Human is basically a lazy race looking for options of minimum inputs and maximum outputs, This is where corruptionn gets in, even America has history of large scale corruption, so iss Europe. But yes, they have learnt from experiences and created systems to minimise it.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-814c4522 data-v-bfed7489><div class="review" data-v-bfed7489><div class="review-title" data-v-bfed7489><span class="icon" data-v-bfed7489>question:</span>it true that the vast majority of Americans truly believe that the USA singlehandedly won the Second World War, and that the British Empire and USSR contributed either nothing or just very little to the Allied victory?</div><div class="divider" data-v-bfed7489></div><p class="review-content" data-v-bfed7489><span class="icon" data-v-bfed7489>answer:</span>I’ve heard a lot of people say that they think a lot of Americans think that, but I don’t know any Americans that actually think that.

Shouldn&#39;t be missed. When it comes to Thrillers, master of the genre Vijay &#39;Goldie&#39; Anand&#39;s films are a case study, they had the most brilliantly crafted and longest climaxes ever, sometimes these climaxes formed the third act of the films and the twists in them will keep you on the edge of your seats even now, whether its Jewelthief or Johny Mera Naam. Most of these films were penned by K.A.Narayan saab, who is again known for writing the longest and most interesting climaxes, one of the most underrated climaxes by Narayan is for Victoria No.203 (that was spoofed wonderfully in the climax of Andaz Apna Apna, one of my most fav. Climaxes in Indian Cinema). As I just spoke about AAA Climax, I think we should also look at some of the funniest and most chaotic climaxes done by Priyadarshan, who brought the house down in the hilarious Hera Pheri climax. But the mother of insanely funny climax for me would be - Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron. Its funny and ironical. Masterpiece of sorts. Another smartly crafted climax was in Waqt, the mother of all lost and found films, this epic film had a climax thats a court room scene and its around 50mins long. Another climax worth mentioning here is Khosla Ka Ghosla - a funny dysfunctional family drama suddenly becomes a con film by the climax and uses the classic &#39;land mine con&#39; and pulls it off with elan. In the recent times, I have enjoyed the very over the top, and unbelievably filmy climax of otherwise realistic - Guddu Rangeela (But thats more like a guilt pleasure).</p></div></div><!--]--><!----></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-814c4522><span data-v-814c4522>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->Neuralink License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 Neuralink</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
