Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author?

The residents are convinced that Nick is in town on an investigation, despite Nick's repeated denials. However, when aircraft factory employee Peter Berton (Ralph Brooks) seeks out Nick and is shot dead before he can reveal anything, Nick is on the case. An old childhood friend, Dr. Bruce Clayworth (Lloyd Corrigan), performs the autopsy and extracts a pistol bullet. Then, when Nick searches Berton's room for clues, he is knocked unconscious by Crazy Mary (Anne Revere), a local eccentric. Nora's innocent purchase of a painting for Nick's birthday present turns out to be the key to the mystery. When she shows it to her husband, it brings back unpleasant memories for him, so she donates it to a charity bazaar. When Edgar Draque (Leon Ames) offers Nora a large sum for the painting, Nick wonders why it is so valuable. Nick learns that Draque's wife Helena (Helen Vinson) bought the artwork, but she is knocked out and the painting disappears. Nick discovers that Crazy Mary is Berton's mother and goes to see her, only to come across her lifeless body. Nick and Nora's dog Asta finds the painting in her shack. Nick puts the pieces together and has the police bring all the suspects to his father's house.

Several people identify it as part of the specifications for a new aircraft propeller worth a great deal to a \\"foreign power\\".

Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice. - Agathocles ( Greek : ; born between 320 -- 310s BC -- died 284 BC ) was a Greek Prince who was of Macedonian and Thessalian descent . He was the son born to Lysimachus from his first wife the Queen consort , Nicaea a daughter of the powerful regent Antipater . His full blooded siblings were his younger sisters : Eurydice and Arsinoe I. Agathocles was sent by his father against the Getae , about 292 BC , but was defeated and taken prisoner . He was kindly treated by Dromichaetes the king of the Getae , and sent back to his father with presents ; but Lysimachus , notwithstanding , marched against the Getae , and was taken prisoner himself . He too was also released by Dromichaetes , who received in consequence the daughter of Lysimachus in marriage . According to some authors it was only Agathocles and according to others only Lysimachus , who was taken prisoner . In 287 BC Agathocles was sent by his father against Demetrius I Poliorcetes , who had marched into Anatolia to deprive Lysimachus of Lydia and Caria . In this expedition he was successful ; he defeated Demetrius I and drove him out of his father 's provinces . Agathocles was destined to be the successor of Lysimachus , and was popular among his subjects . His stepmother Arsinoe II , prejudiced the mind of his father against him and after an unsuccessful attempt to poison him , Lysimachus cast him into prison and had him executed ( 284 BC ) . His maternal cousin - wife and now widow Lysandra with their children fled with Alexander ( Agathocles ' paternal half - brother ) to Seleucus I Nicator in Syria , who made war upon Lysimachus in consequence .

Answer: Although mature clerical script, also called 八分 (bāfēn) script, was dominant at that time, an early type of cursive script was also in use by the Han by at least as early as 24 BC (during the very late Western Han period),[b] incorporating cursive forms popular at the time, well as many elements from the vulgar writing of the Warring State of Qin. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion, but to provide a more detailed and long answer, let's dive deeper into the various scripts used during the Han period in China. The Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) was a time of significant cultural, political, and technological development in ancient China. In terms of writing and scripts, the Han period saw the use of multiple scripts, with some dominating official use and others being popular among the general population. 1. Clerical Script (Lishu, 隶书): As you mentioned, the mature clerical script, also called 八分 (bāfēn) script, was the dominant script in use during the Han period. This script was developed from the earlier seal script and was characterized by its stylized and simplified forms. The clerical script was predominantly used by government officials and scribes for official documents, monumental inscriptions, and stelae, making it the standard script of the time. 2. Cursive Script (Caoshu, 草书): The early form of cursive script was used alongside the clerical script by the Han Dynasty. This script was a faster and more fluid mode of writing, with characters often flowing into one another to promote rapid and efficient writing. It was particularly popular among the educated classes, who might use it for casual correspondence or taking notes. As you mentioned, by at least 24 BC, an early form of cursive script was already in use during the late Western Han period, incorporating elements from both popular cursive writing of the time and vulgar writing from the Warring State of Qin. 3. Seal Script (Zhuanshu, 篆书): Although it was more prevalent during the earlier Qin Dynasty, seal script continued to be utilized during the Han period, mainly for seals, inscriptions on bronze artifacts, and other ceremonial purposes. Seal script is characterized by its elegant, flowing lines and intricate forms, which made it less suitable for everyday use. However, it retained importance for its artistic and historical value. 4. Proto-Regular Script (Kaishu, 楷书): While regular script would not fully develop until the later Wei and Jin dynasties, some early transitional forms between the clerical script and regular script began emerging during the Han period. These proto-regular script forms represented the evolution of Chinese writing toward an even more standardized and simplified script, which would eventually become the standard form of writing in most later dynasties. In conclusion, multiple scripts were indeed used during the Han period, with the mature clerical script being the dominant form. Additionally, early cursive script, seal script, and proto-regular script were used in various capacities, contributing to the rich tapestry of written communication in ancient China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: Blood containing waste products is delivered to the kidneys through the renal arteries. To provide a more detailed explanation, here is the complete process of waste filtration and urine production in the kidneys: 1. Blood containing waste products is delivered to the kidneys through the renal arteries. The renal arteries branch off from the main abdominal artery (aorta) and carry blood to each kidney. This blood contains waste products and toxins that need to be removed to maintain proper body function and acid-base balance. 2. Waste enters the kidneys: The waste-laden blood enters the nephrons, which are tiny filtering units within the kidneys. There are about a million nephrons in each kidney, and their main function is to filter the blood to remove waste products and excess substances. 3. A processing moment in the kidneys lets waste and fluid pass: As blood travels through the nephrons, a process called filtration occurs in the glomerulus - a network of capillaries at the beginning of the nephron. Waste products, excess water, and other small molecules are forced through the filtration membrane, separating them from larger molecules like proteins and blood cells. 4. Prevents larger molecules to pass: The filtration membrane of the glomerulus is a selective barrier, which prevents larger molecules such as proteins and blood cells from passing while allowing smaller molecules like waste products and water to pass into the renal tubules. 5. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: As the filtered fluid moves through the renal tubule, essential nutrients, water, and ions are reabsorbed into the bloodstream through the process of selective reabsorption. This helps to maintain the balance of electrolytes and fluid in the body. 6. Bad waste is removed: The remaining waste products, excess water, and unabsorbed substances continue their journey along the renal tubule and then to the collecting duct. Here, more water is reabsorbed, leading to the concentration of the remaining waste products. 7. The final product is turned into urine: As the concentrated waste products, now called urine, exit the collecting ducts, they enter the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped structure that collects the urine produced by each nephron. The urine then flows from the renal pelvis into the ureters, which are tubes that transport it to the urinary bladder, where it's stored until it's ready to be expelled from the body during urination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This will help you to stay on track, and you can refer back to it when your motivation wanes. For example, if your goal is exercising, on your timeline state that you would like to be able to run a mile in one month. Then make a mini plan for how you will accomplish that goal between now and your one-month mark. Cutting up your goal into increments of time will help you stay focused and keep you from becoming overwhelmed. Control your inner dialogue and practice positive self-talk. Replace negative self-talk such as, “I can't do it,” “I'm not the best,” “I'm not smart enough,” with positive self-talk such as, “I can do it,” “I am the best,” and “I am smart; if they can do it, I can do it.” Stick with your goal by realizing that every process has an ebb and flow. Motivation is not a constant thing. There will be times when you are doing a great job of sticking to your timeline and your goals. However, other times, your motivation will wane, but know that this feeling is not a permanent, lasting feeling. Stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back. When your motivation is low, read a book or a blog about your goal. For example, if your goal is to publish a book or a journal article, read a book about writing for journals and publishers. These books have great tips for staying focused. You can also ask for support when having trouble sticking to your goal. Join an online forum, ask a friend, mentor, or a family member. Remember that talking it out will help you resolve the issue. Summary:","completion":"Creating a timeline for a project or goal is essential to stay on track and maintain motivation. Break down the goal into smaller increments to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Practice positive self-talk by replacing negative thoughts with encouraging statements. Be aware that motivation may fluctuate, and during low-motivation periods, seek inspiration through reading or asking for support from friends, mentors, or online forums.

Answer:","completion":"Henry Chadwick was an English-born American sportswriter, baseball statistician, and historian, born on October 5, 1824, and passed away on April 20, 1908. He played a significant role in the development of baseball and was often referred to as the \\"Father of Baseball.\\" Chadwick contributed immensely to the early days of baseball reporting, which helped the sport gain popularity. He was the editor of the first baseball guide made available for public purchase. This guide provided valuable information about the game, its rules, and its players. The publication of this guide contributed to the growth of the sport among the general public. Chadwick is also credited with the invention of box scores, a statistical summary of a baseball game. Box scores have become an essential part of documenting and understanding a game's progress and outcome. They provide insights into the performance of each player and summarize pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics. He introduced the abbreviation \\"K\\" to signify a strikeout in baseball. The use of this abbreviation has continued to this day as a way to quickly represent the occurrence of a strikeout during the game. Henry Chadwick is said to have created two vital baseball statistics - batting average and earned run average (ERA). The batting average is a measure of a hitter's performance, calculated as the total number of hits divided by official at-bats. The earned run average (ERA) is a pitching statistic that calculates the average number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings pitched. These statistics are fundamental to evaluating player performance and continue to be essential metrics in baseball. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to baseball, Henry Chadwick was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His legacy as an influential figure in the development of baseball and its statistics remains an essential part of the sport's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Anders Behring Breivik admits carrying out a bombing in the capital, Oslo, and going on a shooting rampage on the island of Utoeya, but denies criminal responsibility. The prosecution has asked for the 33-year-old Norwegian to be committed to psychiatric care. The defence insists he is sane. Here is a summary of events in court. The trial ended with defence lawyer Geir Lippestad arguing Breivik should be considered sane, as he had been driven by extreme politics, not violence. He also asked for his client's acquittal - a request regarded as a formality since Breivik considers his actions were justified. When Breivik himself got up to speak about his views, relatives of his victims walked out of the courtroom. The verdict will be announced on 24 August. The government announced that memorials to Breivik's victims would be built at the two attack sites. The prosecution outlined its case for recommending that Breivik should not be sent to prison but confined to psychiatric care. \\"We are not convinced or certain that Breivik is legally insane but we are in doubt,\\" said prosecutor Svein Holden. His colleague Inga Bejer Engh said: \\"We have murderers who have been sentenced to psychiatric care who will probably never get out again.\\" A psychology professor called to testify said he believed Breivik was sane. Svenn Torgersen said he agreed with the conclusions of the second court-appointed psychiatric team. He identified as a weakness the first report's focus on Breivik's childhood. Defence witnesses from the far right backed Breivik's views on Islam in court. They said Norway was threatened by Muslim immigration, an argument used by Breivik in an attempt to justify his attacks. However, the speakers did not condone Breivik's attacks. Breivik's defence said the extremists' testimony proved he was not insane because others shared his views. One of the five judges was caught on camera playing solitaire in court. In a picture published in Norwegian media, Ernst Henning Eielsen could be seen playing the card game on his computer. Breivik told the court he had been slighted by Muslims on several occasions during his childhood. Breivik took stimulants before he launched his deadly attacks, the trial heard. Expert witness Joerg Moerland, a professor of forensic toxicology, said the killer had taken a cocktail of ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin (ECA). \\"You can say that he was lightly to moderately drugged,\\" he added. Experts in far-right ideology told the trial Breivik's ideas should not be seen as the ramblings of a madman. Some of Breivik's former friends testified in court anonymously. At their request Breivik was removed from the court and watched proceedings from a nearby room. One former friend told the court how Breivik isolated himself from friends in the years leading to the attacks, and that he \\"lost the spark of life\\" and became \\"less bubbly\\". Another former friend said Breivik had worried about his looks and had a nose job in 1999 in order to look more \\"Aryan\\". Afterwards Breivik denied this was the case. Norwegian police officers described Breivik's arrest, telling the court he had asked for a plaster to cover up a minor cut and later posed like a bodybuilder when he was stripped of his fake police uniform. Police superintendent Haavard Gaasbakk described the terror of young Utoeya survivors who had mistaken the arrival of police for Breivik's fellow gunmen. He also recalled that Breivik said: \\"You are not the ones I am targeting. I consider you as brothers. It's a coup: I must save Norway from Islamisation.\\" The court heard from another survivor who came to face-to-face with Breivik but was spared because he reminded the gunman of himself. Breivik told the court that he will not appeal agaist a guilty verdict if the court finds him sane. He says he wants to be declared to sane to prove he had rational, ideological motives for the killings. The court also heard more evidence from those who survived the massacre on Utoeya. One, wheelchair-bound Mohamad Hadi Hamed, 21, told the court how his left arm and his left leg were amputated after he was shot by Breivik. Another survivor, Einar Bardal, 17, described how he was trying to escape when he heard a loud bang, followed by a loud beeping noise in in his head. Having shown little emotion during the trial, Breivik acknowledged that the witness testimony was having an effect on him and said: \\"Today I feel almost mentally damaged after having heard these testimonies.\\" Utoeya survivor Tarjei Jensen Bech, 20, likened Breivik to Voldemort, a villain in the Harry Potter novels, saying he had heard him \\"breathing and hissing\\" as he approached the spot where he shot and wounded him in the legs. \\"I like to say I've had more operations than Michael Jackson,\\" he told the court. Ylva Helene Schwenke, now 15, described for reporters how Breivik had shot her in the neck and then several more times as she lay bleeding. \\"He shoots a 14-year old girl from behind, then shoots me twice in the leg,\\" she said. \\"That's the most cowardly thing I've ever heard.\\" Another survivor, 18-year-old Andrine Johansen, told how a boy, Henrik Rasmussen, had thrown himself in the way of bullets meant to kill her. In further testimony from Utoeya survivors, Espen Myklebust told the court how he waited in the water to be rescued, after jumping into the lake and swimming out to a boat that was already full of panicking youths. Mr Myklebust, who suffered a superficial bullet wound in the back, said Breivik was \\"calm as a human being can be\\" during the attacks. \\"He walked around as if nothing had happened.\\" Another witness, Cathrine Troennes Lie, told the court about the last time she had seen her 16-year-old sister before Breivik shot and killed her. The trial continued to hear from survivors wounded during the shooting spree on Utoeya. One, Afghan-born Hussain Kazemi, told the court he saw the waters of the lake around the island red with blood after the attack. During the attack, Mr Kazemi said he briefly met Breivik, who, posing as a policeman, calmly asked him if he knew the whereabouts of the gunman. Mr Kazemi escaped by jumping into the lake as Breivik opened fire. Another witness, Martha Fevang Smith, 18, told the court how she survived being shot in the head while Breivik calmly and deliberately killed 10 others lying nearby. The trial also heard a recording of a panicked emergency call made by witness Renate Taarnes as she hid in a toilet in the camp's cafe while Breivik shot 13 people there. In further evidence from Utoeya survivors, Ingvild Leren Stensrud, told the court that she only lived because she hid under another victim's body as Breivik killed 13 people in the youth camp's cafe. After emerging from her hiding place behind the piano, Ms Stensrud then used the dead girl's phone to try to call emergency services. She also described hearing what she believes was Breivik uttering a battle cry, and that he made sure his victims were dead by delivering a control shot to their heads one by one. The court heard from more people who survived Breivik's attack on Utoeya island. Marta-Johanne Svendsen, who was shot in the arm, described hiding with others in a building known as the school house, and hearing twigs snap as Breivik tried to get in. She said she heard \\"the worst screaming\\". Another, Ina Rangoenes Libak, told how she survived by hiding behind a piano in the cafÃ© building. She was shot four times in the jaw, chest and arms. A man who swam to safety was in tears as he told the court how his friend drowned as Breivik fired on them in the water. The day had a dramatic end when a man set fire to himself outside the courthouse. He was taken to hospital with serious burns to his head and chest. The incident was not thought to be related to the trial. The court hears more testimony from survivors of the Utoeya massacre. One woman, fighting back tears, said she swam more than 600m to safety before realising she had been shot. Another witness who was shot in the lung explained how he hid by covering himself with dirt. A third witness, 20-year-old Frida Holm Skoglund, asked for Breivik to be taken out of court before she testified. She said she fled into woods and removed a bullet from her thigh, before trying to swim to safety along with others - three of whom died. Despite her trauma, Ms Skoglund declared: \\"We won, he lost!\\" There is a dramatic interruption to the trial when a brother of one of those killed throws a shoe at Breivik. The relative screamed at Breivik as he threw the shoe, which missed Breivik, hitting his defence lawyer instead. Members of the public present in the courtroom spontaneously applauded. The incident happened during the presentation of further reports from post-mortems on the victims. It prompted Breivik to reveal that someone had tried to stop him during the attack on Utoeya island by throwing an object at him which hit him in the face. The trial later resumed with more testimony from survivors of the attack on Utoeya island. Eivind Rindal described trying to escape by running through the forest on the island and how Breivik had then shot at him and some other people as they tried to flee in a rowing boat. The survivors of the attack on Utoeya island continue to give testimony. Many relatives, and one of the prosecutors, were reduced to tears as the court heard reports from post-mortems carried out on the victims. Survivor Lars Henrik Rytter Oeberg, who saw Breivik shoot and kill 14 people, described Breivik as having \\"a stone face\\" when he tried to shoot him. For the first time, the court hears testimony from those who survived the attack on Utoeya island. Labour youth leader Tonje Brenna, who organised the event targeted by Breivik, described hiding from the killer in rocks near the lake shore as the bodies of victims fell around her. Local resident Oddvar Hansen told the court how people trying to swim away from the massacre had cried and waved for help. Bjoern Ihler said he and two boys had swum to safety after Breivik approached them, pretending to be a policeman, but then calmly pulled a gun. As on previous days, Breivik remained impassive throughout the survivors' accounts, but complained about being unable to question the witnesses directly. For a third day, the court is told about the autopsies on the Utoeya massacre victims, including that of a 17-year-old girl who was attending her first Labour youth event. Another 17-year-old found dead on the island was a cheerleader at school and planned to go on study in the United States. The Breivik trial continues to hear coroners' forensic reports on those who died on Utoeya. Among the fates detailed where that of a 15-year-old boy who was the youngest to die on Utoeya. Freddy Lie, the father of a 16-year-old girl who died on the island, said his daughter had talked to him on her mobile phone just before she died. The court begins hearing coroners' reports about the autopsies on the 69 people killed on Utoeya Island. Lawyers for their families read out descriptions of those who died and showed pictures to the Oslo court. One young girl, sitting just metres away from Breivik in the courtroom, listened to how her mother died. As on previous days, Breivik seemed unmoved by the evidence. Coroner Torleiv Ole Rognum said the average age of the victims was 18. Witnesses told how they helped Breivik get to Utoeya island because they thought he was a police officer. Breivik was wearing a uniform and showed fake identification papers to a security guard at the quay, who then summoned the ferry. The ferry captain, Jon Olson, described how he helped Breivik carry a case, which proved to be full of weapons, on to the island. Mr Olson's partner was one of the first to die at the youth camp on Utoeya and his daughter was also there. The trial heard harrowing testimony from people wounded in the Oslo bomb attack. Breivik appeared unmoved as a father, Jan Erik Lund, spoke of seeing his daughter Anne Helene seriously injured in hospital. About 40,000 people gathered on a central Oslo square to sing a popular old peace song, Children Of The Rainbow, which Breivik had mocked in court. The singer Lillebjoern Nilsen, accused by Breivik of being a Marxist who sought to brainwash children, led the singing on Youngstorget Square, close to the courthouse. Breivik sought to persuade the trial that he was sane, insisting that his actions were motivated by a political ideology, and that he was accountable for them. He dismissed an initial psychiatric report that found him insane as \\"a lie\\". He said his argument was \\"entirely logical\\" and there was \\"not the slightest possibility\\" he would be judged insane. Breivik said the compilers of the report had no experience in dealing with political extremists and, because they had spoken to him so soon after the attacks, they themselves were still in shock. Security guard Tor Inge Kristoffersen described the moment the car bomb exploded at Norway's government headquarters. He watched on CCTV as a car parked and a man wearing what looked like a guard's uniform got out. Mr Kristoffersen said: \\"Half of our screens, the images disappeared. There was a deep rumbling, the entire block shook, the ceiling bent like water.\\" The police officer who co-ordinated the emergency response, Thor Langli, also gave evidence describing how the bomb squad searched for more bombs. He said a witness saw a small car leave the area, but he felt he could not take any officers away from the site to follow this up. He suggested if CCTV footage had been relayed live to the police, this might have saved vital minutes and could have given them the opportunity to pursue the car. On the last day of giving evidence, Breivik justified his acts as \\"a small barbarian act to prevent a larger barbarian act\\". Saying the killings had been a \\"gruesome\\" experience for him as well, he explained how he had to force himself to do something which felt so \\"against human nature\\". He offered an apology for \\"innocent\\" people who died in the Oslo bombing, referring to those who were passing by and who had no political connections. But asked if he extended that apology to those he killed on Utoeya, he said: \\"No, I do not.\\" He reiterated his belief that they were \\"legitimate targets\\", and added that there were many others in Norway \\"who deserve to be executed, eg journalists and members of parliament\\". He said he understood the loss he had inflicted on victims' families because he had lost his own family and friends after the attack. Breivik described his rampage on Utoeya in chilling detail. Before shooting his first two victims, he said he had \\"100 voices\\" in his head telling him not to do it - but pulled the trigger anyway. Displaying no emotion, Breivik said he proceeded to go to a cafe where several people were hiding, \\"completely paralysed\\" with fear. He said he reloaded his gun after running out of ammunition and killed people as they were begging for their lives. He also shot in the head others who pretended to be dead. Breivik - who was dressed as a police officer - continued his rampage around the island, luring youths from hiding places by telling them he was there to protect them. When they came out, he told the court, \\"I shot towards many of them aiming at their heads.\\" Breivik said he intended hundreds should die in his attack on the Labour Party summer camp, and that a primary target was a former prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland. He claimed he planned to behead Mrs Brundtland, who he thought would be on the island, and post a video of this on the internet. In fact the ex-PM left Utoeya before Breivik arrived. He also hoped his car bomb in Oslo would kill the entire government. Breivik told the court he used computer games to rehearse scenarios ahead of his attacks. He said he had planned three car bombs but opted instead for one bomb attack and one gun attack when he discovered how difficult it would be to make the bombs. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg, at the trial, said Breivik was behaving differently from his irritable performance on Wednesday and he seemed calm. He abstained from giving his usual salute as proceedings began, following a request by the defence team. The prosecution continued its cross-examination of Breivik by trying to disprove his claim of the existence of a far-right European network. They also questioned him on his supposed contacts with Serb nationalists in Liberia, and with English nationalists in London. Breivik was also questioned about his religious beliefs by a lawyer for the victims. He said he wanted to prevent the \\"de-Christianisation of Europe\\". The BBC's Matthew Price, who was in court, said Breivik appeared to be on the back foot - less relaxed than before, and more defensive. Breivik also told the court that there could be only two \\"just\\" outcomes to his trial - acquittal or the death penalty. Proceedings were delayed while the court decided to dismiss a lay judge over remarks made on a social networking site suggesting Breivik should be given the death penalty. Breivik then took the stand and delivered a 13-page statement explaining his political views. In it, he said that he would do it all again, that his actions were \\"based on goodness, not evil\\", and that he had acted to defend Norway against immigration and multiculturalism. The prosecution then began its cross-examination. They cast doubt on his membership of an organisation called Knights Templar, which they assert does not exist. His testimony and that of his witnesses was not broadcast. Anders Breivik pleaded not guilty to the charges. He told the court he \\"acknowledged\\" the acts committed, but said he did not accept criminal responsibility. He said he acted in self-defence. Dressed in a dark suit, he smiled and appeared calm as he entered the court and gave a closed-fist salute. Breivik showed no emotion as harrowing details of how he killed and injured his victims were read out, but later wiped away tears as the court was shown a video he made about multiculturalism prior to the attacks.","completion":"A man named Anders Breivik did some very bad things in Norway. He set off a bomb in a city called Oslo, and then he went to an island and hurt lots of people. He did this because he didn't like some ideas that people in the government had.

Movie plot title: Visitor Q Movie plot: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner.

The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives.

The premise focuses on a specific group of individuals, \\"women,\\" and their action of \\"getting ready for a big concert\\" in a particular setting, \\"a big sub urban town.\\" It offers context to a situation that revolves around the preparation and anticipation of a significant event in a defined locale. This premise sets the stage and tells us who the primary subjects are, and what they are doing. On the other hand, the hypothesis is broader and more general, stating \\"Humans getting ready.\\" It encompasses all humans without gender or locality boundaries and focuses on a universal action of \\"getting ready.\\" This hypothesis could apply to a variety of situations and contexts where humans are preparing for something, from a concert to a party to a business meeting. Now, comparing the two, we can identify certain overlaps. The premise features a specific example where humans (in this case, women) get ready - possibly getting dressed, gathering friends, and making plans, before attending a big concert. The hypothesis, with its general statement, could potentially cover the same ground since women are a subset of humans. However, the premise in and of itself does not directly validate the hypothesis, as it only provides one particular example (women in a specific setting). There might be other examples or timelines where humans aren't \\"getting ready.\\" So, while the premise can be seen as contributing to the overall understanding or discussion surrounding the hypothesis, it cannot single-handedly confirm or refute its truthfulness.

Title: Night of the Living Dead Movie plot: Bickering siblings Johnny and Barbra are traveling by car to a rural cemetery, where they visit their father's grave. Johnny teases his sister's fear of the cemetery after dark, saying \\"They're coming to get you, Barbra!\\" They are approached by a pale-faced man who stumbles toward them and attacks Barbra. Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after tripping and hitting his head violently on the edge of a gravestone. The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it because the keys are in Johnny's pocket. She takes the car out of gear and it begins to drift away on its own, but she accidentally steers it into a tree. She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron. Barbra is further driven into hysteria when she sees Ben violently smashing the skulls of the strange men who keep trying to get into the house. Ben urges her into action and the two of them begin boarding up the doors and windows from the inside with dismantled furniture and scraps of wood. They awkwardly trade their stories; Ben seems to be a drifter who was passing through the area when suddenly a wave of unexplained violence began unfolding.

He took a deep breath, clearly gathering his thoughts before speaking. There was something about his demeanor that told Gwen this conversation was important, perhaps difficult. She nodded, signaling her understanding, and gestured for him to go on. \\"Well,\\" Albertson began, his voice slightly shaky. \\"I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. About us, about our friendship, and about how things have been between us the past few months.\\" He paused, giving Gwen a chance to take in his words. \\"I can't help but feel that maybe... Something's changed.\\" Gwen furrowed her brow, her eyes searching Albertson's face for the meaning behind his words. She couldn't deny that things hadn't been quite the same between them; the warmth and ease in their conversations seemed to have dissipated, replaced by a colder, more distant tone. There had been whispers, too - rumors circulating amongst their coworkers of tension and unresolved feelings. \\"I see,\\" she responded, trying to maintain her usual composure. \\"It's true; our friendship has faced some struggles lately. But that's normal, isn't it? People grow and change, and sometimes relationships need to adjust accordingly.\\" Albertson nodded slowly, perhaps grateful for Gwen's acknowledgment of the situation. \\"Yes, that's true. But I also think it's important for us to address any underlying issues so that we can move forward and continue to have a positive relationship.\\" Gwen considered his words for a moment, noticing a palpable vulnerability in his eyes. She sighed, knowing that he was right. Their friendship, which had once been such a source of support and camaraderie, had begun to feel like a burden. A weariness had settled between them, tinging even the most innocent interactions with an undercurrent of unspoken tensions. \\"Alright,\\" she agreed, \\"let's talk.\\" Over the next few minutes, Albertson shared his concerns and perceptions of where their friendship had gone awry. He spoke of miscommunications and moments of misunderstanding that led to hurt feelings and lingering resentments. Gwen listened intently, her own heart aching as she came to realize the extent of the impact their issues had on Albertson. When he finished, Gwen took her turn, mirroring his honesty with her own forthright admissions. She shared her fears and frustrations, the doubt that had crept into her heart over the course of their strained friendship. As their conversation unfolded, it became apparent to both of them that the root of their difficulties lay not in any particular incident or exchange but in a gradual erosion of trust and openness. They had allowed themselves to become guarded, wary of one another's intentions, and that had led to a deep-seated rift in their relationship. Determined to mend what had been broken, Gwen and Albertson agreed to make a concerted effort to rebuild their friendship. They would be more conscientious about the need for open and honest communication, and commit to resolving disputes and misunderstandings as they arose. Their conversation continued well into Albertson's break, but neither seemed to mind. The sense of urgency that had initially weighed down their exchange gradually lifted, giving way to a renewed sense of hope and anticipation for what lay ahead. As they parted ways, each feeling lighter and more optimistic than they had in months, a mutual understanding passed between them. Though the path to healing would undoubtedly be challenging, they were willing to face it together, side by side, as friends. And if there was one thing that Gwen and Albertson both knew with unwavering certainty, it was that the bond they shared was worth fighting for. After all, true friendship - the kind that transcends time and circumstance - was a rare and precious treasure.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Cosby was born on July 12, 1937 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is one of four sons of Anna Pearl (nee Hite), a maid, and William Henry Cosby Sr., who served as a mess steward in the U.S. Navy. During much of Cosby's early childhood, his father was away from home in Navy service and especially during WWII. As a student, he described himself as a class clown. Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy. He lined up standup jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961. He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on NBC's The Tonight Show. This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, who, in 1964, released his debut LP Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!, the first of a series of comedy albums. His album To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With was number 1 on Spin Magazines list of \\"The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time\\", calling it \\"stand-up comedy's masterpiece\\". While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risque, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, \\"A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\\" In 1983, he released the concert film Bill Cosby: Himself; it is widely regarded as \\"the greatest comedy concert film ever\\". Younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television. Seinfeld said of Cosby: \\"He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote 'comic' and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see on stage.\\" Comedian Larry Wilmore also saw a connection between Bill Cosby: Himself and the later success of The Cosby Show, saying: \\"It's clear that the concert is the template for The Cosby Show.\\" Cosby performed his first TV standup special in 30 years, \\"Bill Cosby: Far From Finished\\", on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013. Cosby's last show of the \\"Far From Finished\\" tour was performed at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia on May 2, 2015. In 2014, Cosby was set to release his new standup special Bill Cosby 77 on Netflix. The release of the film was canceled due to allegations of sexual assault.

King's X is an American rock band that combines progressive metal, funk and soul with vocal arrangements influenced by gospel, blues, and British Invasion rock groups. The band's lyrics are largely based on the members' struggles with religion and self-acceptance. King's X was ranked No. 83 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band was moved up to Megaforce's parent label Atlantic Records for the release of their fourth album, King's X, in early 1992. However, rising tensions with Taylor led the band to eschew the upbeat approach of previous albums and turn out a darker, more introspective effort. Unfortunately, despite critical praise, their new style did not translate well among the record-buying public, thus garnering fewer sales than Faith, Hope, Love. \\"Black Flag\\", the album's lone single, received only moderate airplay on MTV and radio. Not long after the release of King's X, the band parted ways with Taylor. The details of the split were not made public, but it was believed to be rather bitter. Taylor would admit in 1996 that his company Wilde Silas MusicWorks was growing and, as a result, he was no longer giving King's X, whom he considered \\"the top dogs,\\" the attention they deserved. In the aftermath, King's X took over a year off to consider their collective future together. The band members followed other, non-musical pursuits; most notably, guitarist Ty Tabor took up semi-professional motocross motorcycle racing. With grunge at the peak of its popularity, and Pearl Jam's bassist Jeff Ament declaring that \\"King's X invented grunge\\" (despite the group's trademark sound being very different from that of the commercially successful grunge acts), the band went looking for a new sound upon their return. They enlisted veteran producer Brendan O'Brien, who had recently produced albums for Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. The resulting album, 1994's Dogman, showcased a much more muscular and heavy sound from the group, along with less abstract and spiritual lyrics. The record received a heavier promotional push from Atlantic including a compilation promotional CD entitled: Building Blox, as King's X enjoyed a successful tour, capped by an appearance at the Woodstock '94 festival in August. They also toured in support of such bands as the Scorpions, Pearl Jam, Motley Crue and Type O Negative, but despite a return to the Top 100 for the group, the album failed to sell as well as Atlantic had hoped, and the label's support for the group quickly faded. The band's third release under Atlantic, 1996's Ear Candy, would also be their last for the label (not including a subsequent Best of King's X compilation). Although it sold to the band's sizeable core following, it lacked the relative mainstream success of previous efforts. The record was soon out of print, and it seemed that the group's chance for commercial success had come and gone.

Working out tones and firms your muscles, which helps the skin look better. On top of that, exercise aids in circulation which feeds skin cells with oxygen and nutrients, it dilates the skin, and reduces inflammation. There are multiple ways exercise makes you look refreshed. Clean your skin before you work out to help keep your pores unclogged. Keep your skin cooler and cleaner by wearing moisture-wicking clothing to get the perspiration away from your skin. This also helps prevent acne. Exercise in a cool environment that helps keep your body temperature down. This can help prevent flare-ups of some skin conditions. Apply a skin moisturizer. Using skin moisturizer before exercise helps repel sweat, and applying afterwards – especially after swimming – helps fight dry, cracked skin and unhealthy appearance. Exercise reduces stress and anxiety. Feel happy about your condition, your confidence, and your fitness. Even just 15 minutes of exercise can reduce anxiety levels. Studies have shown that alternating hot and cold treatment, even including a sauna, has great benefits. Blood flow is increased, the metabolism speeds up, depression is minimized, and the body is stimulated. After you're cleaned up, alternate between the coldest temperature you can tolerate, then the hottest, and finish with the coldest again. Smoking has been related through studies to a variety of skin aging issues as well as skin conditions like psoriasis. The heat from the cigarette directly affects the skin, and the elasticity is worsened because the blood vessels are constricted. On top of that, levels of vitamin A are reduced. Eat meals healthy for your body, those high in fiber with minimal fats, especially saturated fat. These diets boost energy and mood, while poorer diets make you drowsy and miserable. Choose foods with folic acid and Vitamin B12, like leafy green vegetables and beans, to reduce symptoms of depression. Eat plenty of fruits. Some studies have linked eating fruit to better physical health, and better feelings about personal health. Eat fish often. Multiple studies have linked eating plenty of seafood to lower levels of depression. Try to fit fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids into your daily diet. Drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water per day. Drinking plenty of water has been shown to increase blood flow and elasticity of the skin, making it appear thicker, moister, and healthier.","completion":"Exercise is good for your skin because it helps it look better, keeps it clean, reduces stress, and when combined with a healthy diet, makes you feel good and confident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Gift Movie plot: A young American computer engineer (Shane West as Max Petersen) acquires a mobile phone that receives strange text messages. First they encourage him to miss his flight which he then learns crashed soon after takeoff. Then the messages direct him to buy a certain stock, which he then learns increases by 313%. Next, he is directed to a hotel/casino in Prague to gamble. He first wins one-hundred thousand Euros on a slot machine and then bets the entire amount on a hand of blackjack, getting 21. Both bets are made on the basis of further text messages he receives on his new phone. Max then has an altercation with a beautiful woman (Tamara Feldman) and her jealous boyfriend in the hotel corridor, where he is knocked-out and his mysterious phone is apparently scanned. Max wakes up with the woman, Kamila, smiling above him. He immediately asks her out for a drink.To further his new-found career in gambling, Max enlists the aid of a Russian cabbie/apparent e-gadget enthusiast, Yuri (Sergey Gubanov), who outfits him with an earpiece to wirelessly receive his anonymous and lucrative text messages. His lucky streak continues when he hits the 3 million Euros jackpot on a slot machine but is forced to run away when casino security led by John Reed (Edward Burns) attempts to detain him. This chase is ended by the intervention of FBI Agent Dave Grant (Ving Rhames) who handcuffs Max and interrogates him for information about the phone. Max is frightened, but unable to provide any information.At this point Agent Grant contacts Raymond Burke (Martin Sheen) of the NSA, who is apparently monitoring Max because he is receiving messages from an omniscient communication surveillance computer system known as Echelon. These messages have been responsible for the deaths of several Americans, most recently an IT specialist working in the Pentagon. Burke recently lost a battle to pass a bill in Congress that would allow Echelon to be upgraded by being uploaded into personal computers worldwide. Burke eventually decides that Max knows...

Answer the following question: Process: - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur. suppose less blood pumping occurs happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The scenario provided discusses the process of plant roots breaking apart rocks leading to erosion, and a potential perturbation in the form of less blood pumping, which necessitates examining the effects of this on weathering. Broadly, there are three possibilities: this perturbation can either directly impact a step of the process, indirectly impact a step, or have no impact on any given step of the process. After careful analysis, it can be determined that the supposed perturbation of \\"less blood pumping\\" will not impact any specific step of the process. To understand the reasons behind this conclusion, let's first review each step of the process in detail: 1. A plant grows near or on a rock: The process starts with the growth of a plant in the vicinity of or directly on a rock. This is a natural occurrence, and blood pumping is not an influencing factor. 2. The plant roots begin to grow: As the plant grows, so do its roots, which start to penetrate the rock's surfaces. This root growth is driven by the plant's cells, which contain water and nutrients drawn from the soil. Therefore, blood pumping is irrelevant to the plant's physiological functions. 3. Break apart the rock: As roots continue to expand, they exert pressure on the rock, fracturing it. This process depends solely on the mechanical force exerted by the roots, rather than any biological factor related to blood pumping. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Some plants release organic acids that can dissolve minerals within the rock. These acids are a byproduct of plant metabolism and have no correlation with blood pumping. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As roots continue to grow and the rock weakens, it is broken down further into smaller pieces. This is a result of the pressure exerted by the roots, which, as mentioned earlier, is unrelated to blood pumping. 6. Erosion starts to occur: The smaller pieces of rock eventually become susceptible to erosion by natural forces such as wind or water. Erosion occurs independently of biological influences like blood pumping. Returning to the question of which aspect of the perturbation (less blood pumping) could potentially impact the abovementioned process, it becomes evident that blood pumping does not directly or indirectly affect any of the steps, from plant growth to rock breakdown and subsequent erosion. Blood pumping is a crucial aspect of blood circulation in animals and humans, regulating the flow of nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. However, it is irrelevant to the functioning of a plant, which has a wholly distinct biological system. Consequently, the supposed perturbation of less blood pumping does not influence any part of the process, whether directly or indirectly; it essentially does not impact any step of the weathering process involving plant roots and rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to a source speaking to CNN, the request for the call came from the university's administration. However, backlash from various individuals, including prominent evangelist Franklin Graham, saw the university reverse its decision. Graham took to social media to express his disapproval of Duke University's initial support for the call to prayer, urging donors to withhold their financial support from the school unless it revoked its decision. Graham's post, which quickly gained traction, read: \\"As Christianity is being excluded from the public square and followers of Islam are raping, butchering, and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who doesn't submit to their Sharia Islamic law, Duke is promoting this in the name of religious pluralism. I call on the donors and alumni to withhold their support from Duke until this policy is reversed.\\" The criticism came not just from Graham, but also from thousands who shared his views on social media platforms. Many expressed concern about the potential implications the call to prayer could have for the historically inclusive nature of the university; others wondered why Duke appeared to be endorsing one specific religious tradition when its establishment was built upon religious tolerance and diversity. In light of the backlash, Duke University released a statement indicating its change of course, stating: \\"Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students. However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect.\\" Omid Safi, a professor and the head of Islamic studies at Duke, spoke on his disappointment in the school's decision to reverse its initial support for the weekly call-to-prayer for Muslim students. He expressed his concern that the controversy surrounding the issue could overshadow the more crucial and constructive conversations that need to be had about interfaith relations on college campuses. \\"We need a more nuanced and informed conversation on these important issues,\\" Safi noted. \\"I am disappointed that the call to prayer controversy has become yet another opportunity for certain sectors to depict Muslims as being 'the other,' who don't quite belong to America,\\" he added. Duke University's change of course in allowing the Muslim call to prayer provides insight into the continuing unease surrounding interfaith dialogue and inclusion in higher education institutions. While the initial intent of the university was to demonstrate its support for religious plurality, the resulting uproar served to highlight the difficulties in navigating these conversations. With an increased emphasis on inclusivity, universities across the United States and beyond must grapple with how to acknowledge and respect the diverse religious practices among their student populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This provision authorizes the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to secretly conduct searches of a person's property without providing immediate notice to the property owner or occupants. The \\"sneak and peek\\" provision allows law enforcement officials to request a delayed notification search warrant from a judge, which, if granted, enables them to conduct a search while the residents are away and without their knowledge. The government is then permitted to delay notifying the individual(s) whose premises were searched for a \\"reasonable\\" period of time, which can be extended multiple times by the court if deemed necessary. This controversial provision was originally intended to be employed in terrorism-related investigations; however, over time, its usage has expanded to include other types of criminal investigations as well. Critics of the \\"sneak and peek\\" provision argue that it violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures. They claim that it undermines the requirement for law enforcement agencies to provide probable cause and to obtain a warrant before conducting a search. On the other hand, proponents of the provision argue that it is a necessary tool for law enforcement to effectively combat terrorism and other serious crimes, as it prevents suspects from potentially destroying evidence or alerting co-conspirators. They also maintain that the delayed notification does not mean that the search is warrantless since law enforcement officials must still obtain a warrant from a judge and demonstrate probable cause. Overall, the \\"sneak and peek\\" provision remains one of the most contentious aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act, as it raises significant concerns regarding privacy rights, civil liberties, and the balance between national security and individual freedoms in the post-9/11 era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lip balms come in a variety of forms--tubes, sticks, and pastes. To apply lip balm, rub the tube or stick on your lips (or use your finger to rub on the paste) until they are evenly coated in a thin layer. Apply new lip balm whenever the previous layer wears off.

A strong marketing strategy is also crucial for a film's success. It's important to find ways to create a buzz around the project, encouraging potential viewers to engage with the movie and generate positive word of mouth. This can include social media campaigns, advertising, promotional events, and even merchandise or tie-in products, like soundtracks and novelizations. Lastly, the budget and return on investment are imperative factors to take into account when deciding whether or not to invest in a film proposal. A well-budgeted film that doesn't cost more than what it's expected to make can maximize profit for its investors. Be realistic in estimating production and marketing costs, as well as potential revenue from box office sales, home video releases, streaming deals, and other avenues. In conclusion, when considering whether to invest in a film proposal similar to High School Musical, it's important to examine various aspects like the movie's story, characters, genre, marketing strategy, budget, and long-term financial viability. By carefully weighing the pros and cons, you can make an informed decision regarding your potential investment in the proposed film project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Donny Love was found guilty on 10 charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, for the role he played in the May 4, 2008, attack on San Diego's Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse. No one was injured in the blast that damaged the building's front lobby, shattered a glass door and broke a window in a building across the street. Love could face between 30 years and life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Sheppard. During the two-week trial, prosecutors painted Love as the mastermind behind the blast. He directed two others, Rachelle Lynette Carlock and Ella Louise Sanders to purchase explosive powder and to steal bomb-making materials, they said. Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard. According to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said. Carlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan. At the time of the bombing, Love was in \\"dire financial straits,\\" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases. \\"The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,\\" prosecutors said in a statement. , question: How long could Love get in prison?","completion":"Love could face between 30 years and life in prison."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of James Macpherson's \\"translations\\" of Ossian—from texts that were actually of the \\"translator's\\" own composition.

On the contrary, the premise and the hypothesis seem to contradict each other. Let's break it down and analyze it in further detail. The premise gives us the following information: 1. The subject is a woman. 2. She is wearing shades and a coat. 3. She is looking upward. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the woman is looking at the ground. If we take this at face value, it would mean that the woman is looking downward, as the ground is usually beneath the observer. Upon comparing the premise and the hypothesis, one can notice that the direction in which the woman is looking does not match. The premise clearly states that the woman is looking upward, while the hypothesis suggests she is looking at the ground, which is a downward direction. Therefore, based on the provided information within the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true. Instead, we can infer that the hypothesis is likely false, given the contradiction between the woman's looking direction in the premise and the hypothesis.

Please answer the following question: Marion county used coal and oil to produce electricity, while James county used nuclear energy for its electricity production. Both counties had a flourishing economy. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which county used more nuclear fission to produce energy? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Answer:","completion":"James county used more nuclear fission to produce energy.

It is depicted in the Bollywood movie Mughal-e-Azam that during the Mughal period, she was supposedly ordered to be buried alive between two walls by Mughal emperor Akbar for having an illicit relationship with the Crown-Prince Salim, later to become Emperor Jahangir. Due to the lack of evidence and sources, the story of Anarkali is considered by some to be false for the evidence of her grave and body. The story of Anarkali is not mentioned in the Akbarnama nor in Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri. It was first mentioned by an English tourist and trader William Finch in his journal, who visited India on 24 August 1608.

His power and influence, however, extended over the entire country because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strived to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to himself as an emperor who had near-divine status. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that taught composition at the Leningrad Conservatory? The composer's response to his denunciation was the Fifth Symphony of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his earlier works. Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth brought many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: \\"I'll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about.\\"The success put Shostakovich in good standing once again. Music critics and the authorities alike, including those who had earlier accused Shostakovich of formalism, claimed that he had learned from his mistakes and become a true Soviet artist. In a newspaper article published under Shostakovich's name, the Fifth Symphony was characterized as \\"A Soviet artist's creative response to just criticism.\\" The composer Dmitry Kabalevsky, who had been among those who disassociated themselves from Shostakovich when the Pravda article was published, praised the Fifth Symphony and congratulated Shostakovich for \\"not having given in to the seductive temptations of his previous 'erroneous' ways.\\"It was also at this time that Shostakovich composed the first of his string quartets. His chamber works allowed him to experiment and express ideas that would have been unacceptable in his more public symphonies. In September 1937 he began to teach composition at the Leningrad Conservatory, which provided some financial security but interfered with his creative work.

Please answer the following question: Context: Jordan carefully removed the trap from the trail, so they wouldn't accidentally get caught in it. Question: What will Jordan want to do next? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: look for other traps B: lay out the trap C: walk the trail Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, answer A: look for other traps best answers the question regarding what Jordan would want to do next. This is because Jordan has displayed concern for safety by carefully removing a trap from the trail, which suggests that they want to ensure their own safety and potentially the safety of others. As such, it would be reasonable to assume that Jordan would want to continue looking for other traps along the trail to further reduce the risk of anyone accidentally getting caught. Answer B: lay out the trap is not the most suitable answer. This option implies that Jordan might intend to set up the trap again after removing it, which contradicts their initial action of ensuring safety for themselves and others by removing the trap in the first place. Answer C: walk the trail could potentially be an appropriate answer, but it does not provide the best answer to the question according to the given context. Although walking the trail might be an objective for Jordan, it would make more sense for them to prioritize looking for other traps first, as this action aligns with their concern for safety and their initial action of removing a trap. By checking for additional traps and ensuring a safe passage, Jordan can then proceed to walk the trail with greater peace of mind and a considerably reduced risk of encountering further dangerous traps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The revolt was sparked by the 1541 decree of Châtellerault, which extended a salt tax to Angoumois and Saintonge . It was made compulsory to purchase salt from the salt loft . \\"Gabelle\\" officers took charge of punishing the unlawful trading of salt. But these were salt pan areas where the salt was freely traded. Salt smuggling spread rapidly, especially after the Marennes and La Rochelle revolts in 1542, and the repression by the salt riders is out of the population acceptance. In 1548, riots break out in Angoumois and Saintonge demanding the release of the smugglers . The de Pitauds revolt grew to 20,000 members, led by a lord and joined by priests. Castles were plundered and salt-tax collectors killed. The revolt spread to Bordeaux where 20 salt tax collectors were killed, including the lieutenant governor, on August 21, 1548. King Henry II blockaded Bordeaux and launched his repression. Bordeaux lost its privileges. It was disarmed, paid a fine, saw its parliament suspended, and 1,401 people were sentenced to death. The repression spread to the countryside where the leaders were hanged: neither priests nor gentlemen were spared. The salt-tax was finally abolished in these provinces in June 1549, the provinces became redeemed countries, and the King issued a general amnesty. Answer this question: Which occurred first, the decree of Châtellerault or Marennes and La Rochelle revolts?","completion":"The decree of Châtellerault occurred first. This decree happened in 1541, while the Marennes and La Rochelle revolts happened later, in 1542."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Finding your passion is not always easy, but that doesn't make it any less worth doing. This needs to be one of the guiding principles of your life if you want to make it better-- you only have one life to live, so spend it doing things you love. Make a list of your favorite activities. What is most important to you in life, friends, family, fulfillment, a good job? Plan around these important causes. While everyone has to do things \\"just to survive,\\" these jobs will be easier to get through if you are also working towards a long-term dream. Make a list of tangible, real goals and commit to achieving them. This gives you milestones to reach for and makes bettering your life an attainable adventure, not a series of confused stabs in the dark. Goals can be big, like running your own company, or small, like exercising every day. Just make sure you know what you want to change before you start changing. Once you have goals it's time to make them a reality, one small step at a time. Draft a list of the things you need to do to make your dreams come true. For example, if you want to be a TV show writer, you might: Learn how to write scripts. Write and edit your first TV pilot. Submit your pilot to contests and fellowships. Move to LA to learn the industry. Keep writing new pilots until one gets picked up. The only way to improve is to learn, so find time to teach yourself something new every day. Be humble enough to ask for advice or guidance from friends and experts as you grow as a person and a professional. Read/watch the news daily. Read a book. Learn a new word. Anything that makes you smarter than the day before is something to be proud of. Even people happy with their jobs can benefit from continued education, as it makes you a better person with more insight and wisdom. Consider night school or online classes if you want to change careers but can't afford to quit work just yet. Listen more, talk less. You'll be surprised what people have to offer you. Work for the job you want, not the one you have. When your Manager/Boss realizes that you are eager to learn, you will move up the ladder in no time. Do the best you can on any project or assignment you are given and be willing to help your coworkers when they need a hand. If you exude positive, hardworking vibes, someone will eventually notice. Crafting a happy, fulfilling future does not take place overnight. Some experts have estimated that it takes 10,000 hours to reach true mastery in any subject, which means you have to work hard to reach the future you want. But if you are truly happy doing something, the work required to get there should not feel like a chore. Focus on your goals and the steps needed to reach them. Celebrate little milestones on your way to your better future life. Know that setbacks happen, but handling them positively will bring your closer to your goals.

During this time, she gives a voiceover as if talking to a psychiatrist who she thinks will put her on antidepressants, and she gives a prediction of her life all the way to her old age.At home, Veronika pours herself a drink and takes a number of prescription medications out of her bathroom medicine cabinet. She arranges the bottles in a line on her coffee table, and then lays out a number of pills. Putting on some music, Veronika swallows the pills one by one, washing them down with her drink.As the pills take effect, Veronika starts to type out an email to her parents, ominously telling them that none of what is about to happen, is their fault. Deleting the email, she picks up a fashion magazine and instead begins to type out an email to the Village Voice, lambasting them over a fashion slogan she sees as a lie.

However, underlying tensions and external threats test the unity and resilience of the miners as Barret navigates them through countless trials and tribulations while uncovering shocking secrets from his past. Act One: Hull Barret, the leader of a close-knit group of miners, gets a sudden strike of luck when he discovers a new and untapped vein of gold during a routine excavation. His group revels in the find, and they finally see a light at the end of the unrelenting hardships they faced through their mining years. The news of this valuable discovery quickly spreads through the isolated mining town, and soon enough, the entire community is aware of the newfound riches buried beneath the earth. Act Two: However, with newfound wealth comes the greed of external parties. A ruthless and corrupt mining company known as Rockstone Industries learns of the deposit and is determined to siphon off the gold, no matter the cost. Their arrival in the mining town leads to major conflicts as Barret rallies the miners against the invasive company. Simultaneously, Barret's past comes back to haunt him, as it is revealed that he was once a high-ranking member of Rockstone Industries. He had left the company after realizing their morally corrupt practices and sought redemption by becoming a humble miner. The conflict becomes personal, as Barret is forced to confront his old adversaries while protecting the mining community from their exploitation. Throughout the struggle, in-fighting erupts among the miners, as some are seduced by the promises of Rockstone Industries, while others remain loyal to Barret. Fights break out between the groups, and the community is driven through a civil war as Barret scrambles to maintain order.

In an emotional conclusion, the mining town slowly transitions from a hub of mining activity to a thriving community based on unity and brotherhood, with new industries and opportunities finally replacing the dangerous dependency on gold. Hull Barret remains the heart of the town, remembered as a symbol of integrity and self-sacrifice, thus redeeming himself from his past mistakes and paving the way for a brighter collective future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Guy Fawkes was born and schooled in which English city?","completion":"Guy Fawkes, also known as Guido Fawkes, was born and schooled in the English city of York. York is located in the northeastern part of England, and it is known for its rich history and well-preserved architecture, including the famous historical landmarks such as York Minster, Clifford's Tower, and the city walls. Guy Fawkes was born on April 13, 1570, to Edward Fawkes and Edith Blake-Fawkes. His father was a proctor and an advocate of the consistory court of the diocese of York. Guy Fawkes' family was part of the Church of England, but his maternal grandparents were recusant Catholics, who refused to conform to the Anglican Church. Fawkes attended St. Peter's School in York, which was a prestigious institution known for providing a solid education. It was during his time at this school that Fawkes likely became acquainted with Catholicism, as some of the school's faculty were known to be Catholics or have sympathy for the Catholic faith. Despite his exposure to Catholicism at school, Fawkes initially followed in his family's footsteps and was a member of the Church of England. It wasn't until later in his life, after the death of his father and his mother's remarriage to a Catholic man, that Fawkes became more deeply involved in the Catholic faith and ultimately joined the cause to restore Catholicism as the dominant religion in England. This dedication to the Catholic faith emboldened Guy Fawkes to participate in the infamous Gunpowder Plot. In 1605, along with a group of English Catholics led by Robert Catesby, Fawkes plotted to assassinate King James I, who was a Protestant, by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during its State Opening. The ultimate goal was to replace King James I with his Catholic daughter, Princess Elizabeth, and to end the repression of Catholics in England. However, the plot was discovered before it could be executed, and Fawkes along with his fellow conspirators was arrested, tried, and executed for high treason. In conclusion, Guy Fawkes was born and schooled in York, a city with a rich cultural and historical background. His early exposure to Catholicism at school and in his family eventually led him to participate in one of the most notorious failed plots in British history. Despite the dark legacy associated with Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot, his story remains an important part of English history and serves as a reminder of the religious tensions that existed in 17th-century England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. Question: When did the registration process end? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide a specific date or time for when the registration process ended.

If \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks down the sidewalk.\\", does this mean that \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks outside.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks down the sidewalk\\" implies that \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks outside.\\" To provide a more in-depth analysis and explanation, let's break down the elements of the original statement. 1. \\"A lady\\": This refers to an adult female person. 2. \\"in winter wear\\": This speaks to the clothing the lady is wearing and indicates that she is dressed in clothes suited for cold weather. Winter wear typically includes items such as coats, scarves, gloves, and boots to keep a person warm. 3. \\"carrying a purse\\": This means that the lady is carrying a bag or pouch, typically used to carry personal belongings like a wallet, keys, or phone, and possibly some other personal items. 4. \\"walks down the sidewalk\\": This is the primary action that takes place in the statement. 'Sidewalk' is a paved footpath designed for pedestrians, usually found alongside roads or streets in populated areas. This element suggests that the lady is walking on a pedestrian path outdoors. Now, let's break down the elements of the second statement: 1. \\"A lady\\": This again refers to an adult female person. 2. \\"in winter wear\\": This also indicates that she is dressed in clothes suited for cold weather. 3. \\"carrying a purse\\": This means that the lady is again carrying a bag or pouch, where she might be keeping her personal belongings. 4. \\"walks outside\\": This is the primary action described in this statement. The term 'outside' refers to being in the open air and not within a building or another form of shelter. Walking outside suggests that the lady is in an outdoor environment. Comparing the two statements, we can see that their main difference lies in the terms used to describe the location of the lady. In the first statement, the lady is described as walking \\"down the sidewalk,\\" while in the second statement, she is described as walking \\"outside.\\" Since sidewalks are by their nature located outside, the two statements describe essentially the same action—the lady walking outdoors while wearing winter clothes and carrying a purse. Therefore, \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks down the sidewalk\\" does mean \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks outside.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: Scientists have discovered three new species of dragon-esque woodlizards in the Andes of Peru and Ecuador. The new species differ from their closest relatives in scale features, coloration and DNA. The study was published in the open access journal ZooKeys. Field and laboratory work by Omar Torres-Carvajal (Museo de Zoología QCAZ, Ecuador), Pablo J. Venegas (CORBIDI, Peru), and Kevin de Queiroz (Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, U.S.A) has resulted in the discovery of three new species of dragon-esque woodlizards from Andean cloudforests in Ecuador and Peru. The unusual discoveries took place in areas within the 1,542,644 km2 Tropical Andes hotspot, western South America. Finding three new species of woodlizards is a striking fact given that they are among the largest and most colorful lizards in South American forests. Woodlizards (Enyalioides) are diurnal and live in lowland tropical rainforests, such as the Chocó and western Amazon basin, as well as cloudforests on both sides of the Andes. The new species described by Torres-Carvajal et al. increases the number of species of woodlizards to 15. Recent expeditions to several localities along the Andes of Ecuador and Peru led to the collection of several specimens of woodlizards, which the authors suspected were something new. After comparing the new specimens with those deposited in several natural history museums from many countries, the author's suspicions became stronger. When the authors looked at DNA evidence, there were no doubts that the specimens collected recently belonged to three undescribed species of woodlizards. 'I started working with woodlizards in 2006 as part of my postdoc at the Smithsonian Institution under the direction of Kevin de Queiroz. At that time only seven species of woodlizards had been described, and they were recognized in the literature as one of the less diverse groups of South American lizards. During the last few years we doubled the number of known species of woodlizards, showing that the diversity of these conspicuous reptiles had been underestimated. That more than half of the diversity of a group of large, dragon-looking reptiles from South America has been discovered in recent years should be heard by people in charge of conservation and funding agencies' said Dr. Torres-Carvajal. # Original source: Torres-Carvajal O, Venegas PJ, Queiroz K (2015) Three new species of woodlizards (Hoplocercinae, Enyalioides) from northwestern South America.

Woodlizards are often described as miniature dragons because of their probing eyes, richly patterned skin and rows of spikelike scales. Until now, only 12 species of the genus Enyalioides were known, and five of those were discovered in just the past seven years. They're not exactly \\"Game of Thrones\\" dragons, but woodlizards have occasionally been compared to the mythical beasts because of their spiky scales and probing eyes. This newly discovered species, dubbed Enyalioides anisolepis, is only about 5 inches (13 centimeters) long. It lives in the cloud forests of northern Peru and southern Ecuador. Omar Torres-Carvajal The three new species were found in the cloud forests of Peru and Ecuador, an international research team reported Monday in the journal ZooKeys. These high-altitude tropical forests are permanently shrouded in fog and mist, creating an otherworldly environment that abounds in biological diversity. [In Photos: Life Up in the Clouds] The team, led by Omar Torres-Carvajal of the Museo de Zoología QCAZ in Ecuador, also ferreted out the five other woodlizard species recorded in recent years. \\"The diversity of these conspicuous reptiles has been underestimated,\\" Torres-Carvajal said in a statement. Woodlizards grow to be between 3 and 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) long, making them one of the largest lizards in the Amazon rainforest. The lizards' colors and patterns help them blend into the environment, the researchers said. This adult female specimen, found in Ecuador, represents a new species of woodlizard dubbed Enyalioides altotambo. Both males and females resemble the thick-necked, warty dragon named Gronckle from the 2010 film \\"How to Train Your Dragon.\\" Luis A. Coloma Each of the three new species differs from its relatives by body characteristics such as color, scale shape and size, as well as their mitochondrial DNA, the study reported. The new species were named E. sophiarothschildae, after Sophia Rothschild, a donor to Germany's BIOPAT program; E. anisolepis, which refers to the Greek term for \\"unequal scales\\"; and E. altotambo, after Alto Tambo, the Ecuadorean town where the bright green lizard was found. — Becky Oskin, LiveScience This is a condensed version of a report from LiveScience.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Paragraph: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and context, Jim, who skipped his warm-up before exercising, has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury compared to Tom. To understand why this is the case, it's essential to recognize the importance of warm-ups in physical activities like running. When a person warms up properly, they gradually increase the intensity of the activity, preparing the muscles and tendons for the demands of the exercise, and reducing the likelihood of injury. Warm-ups serve several purposes, including: 1. Increasing blood flow to the muscles: As the heart rate goes up, blood flow improves, ensuring that the muscles receive an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. This boosts muscle and tendon performance during the exercise. 2. Enhancing flexibility and range of motion: A warm-up loosens the muscles and tendons, making them more pliable and less susceptible to strains or tears when they are suddenly stretched during physical activity. 3. Elevating body temperature: Warming up the muscles can help reduce the risk of injury, as warmed-up muscles can absorb shock and load better than cold muscles. 4. Mentally preparing the individual: A warm-up routine also serves as a mental preparation for the physical activity ahead, helping the individual to focus on the task, identify potential sources of strain, and make any necessary adjustments to technique or body mechanics. In the case of Tom and Jim, since Jim did not warm up before engaging in the exercise, his muscles and tendons were not properly prepared for the demands of running. Consequently, his body was more prone to injury, and he had a greater chance of experiencing a tendon injury than Tom, who warmed up appropriately before running."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Jets played a rare road game at home, as they took on their intracity rivals (and stadium co-tenants), the New York Giants. Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown. One last attempt by the Jets to score yielded no positive yardage, and the Giants ran out the clock to preserve the victory. Question: How many yards did Mike Nugent kick for successful field goals?

Movie Title: Disastrous Dreams Disastrous Dreams hit theaters with a tantalizing trailer, promising an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. However, the unrealistic plot, lackluster performances, and poor attention to detail thwarted any potential it may have held. Here is a breakdown of the film's failings: 1. Unbelievable storyline: A step-by-step walk through the plot reveals several glaring inconsistencies. It's hard for any viewer to accept that a time-traveling smartwatch, powered by a potato, can save humanity from an alien invasion. The concept itself is difficult to take seriously, making it challenging for the audience to become immersed in the story world. 2. Lackluster performances: The casting decisions for Disastrous Dreams were, to put it mildly, misguided. The lead actor appeared to be more focused on flexing his muscles than portraying an emotional connection with the audience. Additionally, supporting characters constantly shifted accents, leaving one to wonder about their origins and intentions. This was distracting and further detracted from the storyline. 3. Poorly executed special effects: The visual effects in Disastrous Dreams were a disappointment. The alien invaders appeared almost cartoonish, making it impossible to take them seriously as a threat to humanity. Moreover, the time-travel sequences were jarring, bearing an uncanny resemblance to a PowerPoint presentation. 4. Predictable clichés: The film's script included a plethora of overused movie tropes, constantly reminding the viewer they were watching a subpar attempt at a blockbuster. From the last-minute rescue scenes, to the tacked-on love interest subplot, the unimaginative narrative rehashed tired ideas instead of exploring fresh, compelling ones. 5. Rushed conclusion: In a desperate attempt to wrap up the plot, the climax of Disastrous Dreams was confusing and unsatisfying. The hasty resolution prevented the audience from experiencing the thrill that an action-packed finale should deliver. A baffling, unexplained twist left viewers scratching their heads rather than clamoring for a potential sequel. In conclusion, Disastrous Dreams had all the makings of a thrilling, audience-pleasing film but was undermined by its poorly-executed premise and disregard for credibility. It would be best to avoid this film and invest your viewing hours in a more deserving and well-executed production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \\"Flipper\\" in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.[7] Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world. After meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. In a nearby, isolated cove, however, surrounded by wire fences and \\"Keep Out\\" signs, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. In the cove, a group of Taiji fishermen engage in dolphin drive hunting. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins, female bottlenose dolphins, to aquariums and marine parks and killing the majority of the rest. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets.

Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight. I am facing a new situation today: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right.

Answer:","completion":"To answer the question correctly, we will apply the knowledge from the background article to the fourth row of the periodic table. Step 1: Understand the trends in electron count across the periodic table. The background article states that the increase in electrons across the periodic table causes elements to go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Step 2: Identify the position of metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. Metals are found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are on the right side. Step 3: Determine the electron count for metals and nonmetals within the same row. As we move from left to right across a row (period) in the periodic table, the electron count increases. Thus, elements on the left side (metals) will have fewer electrons compared to those on the right side (nonmetals). Step 4: Answer the question using the determined information. Given two elements in the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process would most likely involve the disruption of the entire ecosystem and its intricate balance, leading to long-term detrimental effects on biodiversity, habitat loss, and ultimately, a decline in the health of the environment. When acid rain alters the pH level of aquatic habitats, it not only directly affects fish, frogs, plants, insects, and other wildlife but also disrupts the food chain. The death of primary producers such as plants and algae reduces the food supply for herbivorous species that rely on these autotrophs for nourishment. This, in turn, affects the carnivorous species that feed on the herbivores, leading to a cascading effect throughout the food chain. In addition, when an ecosystem loses keystone species, those that play a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of the ecosystem, it results in an imbalance. A loss of these key species can cause a domino effect of decline among other species in the ecosystem, ultimately leading to a reduction in biodiversity. As biodiversity decreases, ecosystems become less resilient against other stressors, such as disease, invasive species, and climate change. Habitat loss is another consequence of the acidification of waters, as the death of plants and other organisms alters the physical structure of aquatic habitats. Vital breeding and spawning grounds for fish and amphibians may be destroyed, further exacerbating the decline of these populations and making it more challenging for them to recover. Additionally, when increased aluminum levels are absorbed by plants in the surrounding area, their growth may be stunted or inhibited altogether, resulting in soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and further habitat loss for other terrestrial species. All of these factors combined culminate in a weakened and vulnerable ecosystem, susceptible to further environmental stressors. These changes can lead to a decline in the overall health of the environment, impacting not only the flora and fauna within the ecosystem but also potentially affecting the ecosystem's services, such as providing clean water, storing carbon, and supporting human livelihoods. Thus, the last step of the process involves the widespread destabilization of ecosystems and the degradation of environmental health, ultimately affecting various species, their interactions, and the overall structure and functioning of ecosystems. To mitigate and reverse these adverse effects, it is essential to address the root causes of acid rain, mainly by implementing policies and technologies that reduce emissions of the pollutants responsible for its formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Going back to school is a very exciting event for my two boys. It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Dan learned about the atmosphere of Earth, while Nate learned about planet Venus and its atmosphere. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about the planet with a hotter surface temperature? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"Dan learned less about the planet with a hotter surface temperature. While both students were studying atmospheres and planets, Dan focused on Earth's atmosphere, and Nate studied Venus and its atmosphere. The hint provided states that Venus has a much hotter surface temperature than Earth due to its thick atmosphere, strong greenhouse effect, and a surface temperature reaching 465°C (860°F), which is hot enough to melt lead.

He slowly begins to uncover an enigmatic conspiracy within the city's underbelly while investigating a series of high-profile kidnappings. Unknowingly, Ludlow discovers that his superior officer, Captain Ronald Wander, is the mastermind behind the sinister plot and has been using him as a pawn to execute his diabolic schemes. Act I: Detective Jack Ludlow is assigned to investigate the abduction of a prominent businessman's daughter, Amy Matherson. Working alongside his close friend, Officer Helen Carter and under the supervision of Captain Wander, Ludlow starts unraveling the web of clues surrounding Amy's case. A series of kidnappings start happening throughout the city, leaving a cryptic symbol behind at each scene that appears to be a calling card from the kidnappers. Captain Wander remains supportive throughout, but Ludlow begins to feel like there is more to the story than meets the eye. Act II: As Ludlow digs deeper into the evidence, he discovers a pattern that links the abducted people to a multi-billion-dollar deal being negotiated between the government and a private corporation. Initially, Ludlow suspects that the kidnappings are the work of a rival corporation, aiming to sabotage the deal. His investigations lead him to encounter a disgraced former cop turned informant, who drops subtle hints that point Ludlow in the right direction: Captain Wander. In a thrilling twist, Ludlow finally uncovers the hidden motives of Captain Wander. He learns that Wander has been embroiled in a vast conspiracy with a powerful criminal organization intending to gain control of the city's infrastructure and hold the government hostage.

The climax of the movie involves an intense showdown between Ludlow's team and Captain Wander's forces on a remote island where the remaining kidnap victims are being held. In a high-stakes showdown that tests their loyalty and courage, Ludlow and Wander engage in a physical and psychological battle. In the end, Ludlow manages to save the remaining kidnap victims and exposes the corruption within the police department. Captain Wander is defeated and brought to justice, but not before hinting at the possibility that there might be other conspirators lurking in the shadows. The movie concludes with Ludlow vowing to continue the fight against the criminal underworld and protect his city. This gripping tale of loyalty, betrayal, and justice, set against the city's crime-riddled backdrop, would make for an exhilarating and deeply engaging cinematic experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, several advocates have recently raised concerns about design flaws in some of the newly-introduced taxi models, with critics arguing that these issues compromise the safety, comfort, and convenience of both passengers and drivers. A Glimpse into the New Taxi Designs Leading the charge in revolutionizing the taxi industry are urban mobility pioneers, with manufacturers touting spacious cabins, ergonomic interiors, and cutting-edge features as main selling points for their latest taxi models. Emphasizing fuel-efficiency, accessibility, and state-of-the-art technology, these new taxis are expected to deliver better user experiences and contribute positively to the environment. Design Flaws: Are Passengers and Drivers at Risk? Despite the exciting prospects of these new-generation taxis, recent reports and accounts from various stakeholders paint a less-than-perfect picture. A growing number of advocates, including disability campaigners, safety experts, and regular users, argue that the new taxis come with significant design flaws, which may affect the overall user experience and compromise safety. 1. Limited Accessibility for Passengers with Disabilities One of the major concerns raised by disability advocates is the limited accessibility options in some new taxi designs. Wheelchair users often struggle to find sufficient room to maneuver, while passengers with mobility aids might face difficulty in entering and alighting the vehicle. For a transportation option that is expected to serve all members of the public, such shortcomings can be seen as a significant barrier to inclusivity. Designers must put a greater emphasis on accessibility when creating taxi designs, ensuring that their vehicles cater to users of all abilities. 2. Uncomfortable Seating Arrangements for Passengers Modern taxi designs are not just criticized for their lack of accessibility, but also for their often-uncomfortable seating arrangements. Passengers report limited legroom, awkward seat angles, and uncomfortable ingress and egress in some of the new taxi models. Such experiences deter passengers from choosing taxis as their preferred mode of transportation, leading to a decline in ridership and revenues for drivers. 3. Compromised Driver Safety Drivers have also voiced concerns about the new taxi designs, particularly when it comes to visibility and access to controls. Some vehicles feature small rear windows or an obstructive central console, making it difficult for drivers to maintain full situational awareness and increasing the risk of accidents. Additionally, the layout of controls and buttons in certain models could lead to driver distraction, as drivers might struggle to locate and operate essential functions while on the road. Manufacturers' Responses and the Way Forward In response to the criticism from various stakeholders, some manufacturers have taken steps to address the design flaws by engaging in dialogue with concerned parties, such as disability advocacy groups and road safety experts. A few taxi operators have also initiated pilot programs for testing potential design improvements to enhance accessibility, comfort, and safety. To ensure that the new wave of taxis truly caters to the diverse needs of passengers and drivers, all stakeholders in the taxi industry must collaborate and communicate effectively. By working together, they can identify and rectify design flaws, create more inclusive and functional taxi designs, and ultimately, provide a safer and more enjoyable experience for all users. Conclusion As technological advancements continue to disrupt the transportation landscape, the focus must not shift solely towards innovation and efficiency, but rather, it should prioritize the protection and enhancement of the experiences of passengers and drivers alike. By addressing the current design flaws in new-generation taxis, manufacturers and operators, city officials, and other stakeholders can ensure that the taxi industry remains a viable, accessible, and beneficial option for urban mobility in the years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Ryan Reynold’s “Deadpool 2” is set to take the No. 1 box office crown from “Avengers: Infinity War” this weekend, with 133.5 million from 4,349 North American locations. The third R-rated superhero film from Fox took in 53.3 million Friday, including a record-setting 18.6 million from Thursday previews, the highest Thursday tally for an R-rated film (“It” had previously held the title with 13.5 million). “Deadpool 2’s” 4,349 theaters also mark Fox’s widest launch ever. The “Deadpool” sequel will break its own predecessor’s record as the highest opening weekend for an R-rated film — “Deadpool” stunned the industry two years ago with 132.4 million. The original’s unique take on the superhero genre, with Reynolds breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly, made the film a must-see, and it went on to earn 363 million in North America and 783 worldwide, making it the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. Reynolds returns as the wisecracking mercenary in the 11th title in the X-Men franchise. David Leitch replaced Tim Miller as director, helming from a script by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds. The story sees Deadpool forming the X-Force — comprised of Zazie Beetz’s Domino, T.J. Miller’s Weasel, Terry Crews’ Bedlam, Bill Skarsgard’s Zeitgeist, and Rob Delaney’s Peter — to protect a young mutant from Josh Brolin’s Cable. Related Ryan Reynolds Wants to Explore Deadpool's Bisexuality in Future Films North American Box Office Hits Record 3.33 Billion in Second Quarter “Infinity War” will drop down to the second place slot in its fourth weekend with 27 million from 4,002 domestic sites, down 472 from last weekend. The Disney-Marvel tentpole has become the fourth-highest grossing film at the worldwide box office with 1.710 billion, topping “Jurassic World’s” 1.671 billion. The film has earned 566.3 million domestically in its first 21 days, along with 1.136 billion internationally. In third is the debut of Paramount’s “Book Club,” starring Jane Fonda, Candace Bergen, Diane Keaton, and Mary Steenburgen. The film will top early estimates, which had pegged it in the 7 million to 10 million range, with 13 million from 2,781 cinemas. Fonda, Bergen, Keaton, and Steenbergen star as four women who read “Fifty Shades of Grey” in their book club and are inspired to spice up their lives. The film has received mixed reviews and carries a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Melissa McCarthy’s Mother’s Day opener “Life of the Party” will reel in around 7 million in its second weekend from 3,656 sites to take the fourth place slot. McCarthy plays a mother who enrolls in the same college as her daughter to earn her degree after divorcing her husband. “Show Dogs,” from Global Road, will take in 5 million from 3,212 sites for fifth. Directed by Raja Gosnell, the family film follows a rottweiler police dog and his owner going undercover at a prestigious dog show to stop a crime. Will Arnett stars alongside the voice cast of Ludacris, Jordin Sparks, Gabriel Iglesias, Shaquille O’Neal, Stanley Tucci, and Alan Cumming. POPULAR ON VARIETY: ||||| The sequel doesn't match the opening of the first 'Deadpool' in the U.S., but launches to a record 176 million overseas; the adult-skewing 'Book Club' opens to 12.5 million, while 'Show Dogs' falters. Superheroes continued to dominate the box office over the weekend as Ryan Reynolds and Fox's Deadpool 2 bowed to 125 million domestically and 301 million globally after scoring the biggest foreign debut ever for an R-rated title. After falling off more than expected on Saturday, the sequel couldn't match the North American opening of the first Deadpool, which launched to 132.4 million in February 2016, the best showing in history for an R-rated title. Nevertheless, Deadpool 2 still scored the third-best domestic bow of the year to date behind fellow superhero tentpoles Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther, as well as the No. 2 launch ever for an R-rated film. It is also Fox's second biggest weekend opening in history behind Deadpool. Overseas, Deadpool 2 rocketed to 176 million from 81 markets, Fox's biggest opening of all time internationally — and that's without China, where the film doesn't yet have a release date. X-Men: Days of Future Past was the previous Fox champ (174 million), while Fox's Logan had been the record holder for biggest foreign bow for an R-rated movie (160 million). Playing in a total of 4,349 theaters in North America — the widest release in Fox history — Deadpool 2 was frontloaded. It earned a massive 18.6 million in Thursday-evening previews, followed by 53 million on Friday, the top opening day for an R-rated pic. Like Deadpool, the sequel earned an A CinemaScore from audiences. The film skewed male (61 percent), while a pleasing 38 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25. Deadpool 2, directed by David Leitch, follows the irreverent Deadpool (Reynolds) as he forms an X-Force posse in hopes of stopping the evil Cable (Josh Brolin). Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand and Jack Kesy co-star. Reynolds produced the sequel and co-wrote the script with his Deadpool collaborators Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. \\"The audience's appetite for Merc with the Mouth hasn't waned at all,\\" says Fox domestic distribution chief Chris Aronson. \\"And Ryan Reynolds was tireless in promoting this movie on a global basis.\\" The foreign opening was up 7 percent when comparing like markets to like markets, while Deadpool 2 came in 5.5 percent behind Deadpool's domestic debut. (The first film bowed over the long Presidents Day/Valentine's Day weekend.) Offshore, the U.K. led with 18 million, followed by South Korea (17 million), Russia (11.8 million), Australia (11.7 million) and Mexico (10.1 million). Deadpool 2 — which hit theaters as the Fox film empire prepares for the Disney/21st Century Fox merger — easily toppled Disney and Marvel's superhero mashup Infinity War from the top spot. The latter pic was no slouch, however, grossing 28.7 million in its fourth weekend to finish Sunday with a North American total of 595 million and topping the 1.8 billion mark worldwide. Overseas, Infinity War earned another 84.4 million, fueled by another 53.7 million in China for a foreign total of 1.218 billion and global haul of 1.813 billion, the No. 4 gross of all time. In China, the film cleared the 300 million mark, a feat accomplished by only three other Hollywood titles. Paramount's hit horror film A Quiet Place also made noise in China with an opening of nearly 18 million, bringing that movie's global total to 296.5 million (many think the China debut will end up closer to 19 million). Thanks in large part to the strength of Deadpool 2 and Infinity War, domestic revenue was up a staggering 64 percent over the same weekend last year, when new openers included Alien: Covenant. Infinity War came in No. 2 over the weekend, followed by Paramount's adult-skewing, female-fronted Book Club in third place with 12.5 million from 2,781 theaters, slightly ahead of expectations. An estimated 80 percent of ticket buyers were female, while nearly 90 percent of the audience was over 35 — including 60 percent over 50. Directed by Bill Holderman, Book Club stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen as four friends who decide to read Fifty Shades of Grey with unintended consequences. Craig T. Nelson, Andy Garcia and Don Johnson play the love interests. \\"In a weekend of Deadpool and the Royal Wedding ... we hit the bullseye — we got the underserved audience this movie was made for, and who also don’t tend to come out opening weekend,\\" says a spokesperson for Paramount, which acquired rights to the movie for 10 million. The third new nationwide offering of the weekend, Show Dogs, couldn't quite find its bark. The family film opened in sixth place with 6 million from 3,145 cinemas. Rated PG, the Global Road pic chronicles the adventures of a Rottweiler police dog (voiced by Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges) that infiltrates a prestigious dog show with the help of his human partner (Will Arnett). Other castmembers include Natasha Lyonne, Jordin Sparks, Gabriel Iglesias, Shaquille O'Neal and Alan Cumming. Both Book Club and Show Dogs earned an A- CinemaScore. Back in the top five, Melissa McCarthy's Life of the Party fell a steep 57 percent in its second weekend to 7.7 million for a domestic total of 31 million, and the Gabrielle Union thriller Breaking In fell even more in its sophomore outing, dipping 63 percent to 6.5 million for a 10-day total of 28.7 million. New openings at the specialty box office included A24's First Reformed, directed by Paul Schrader. The critically acclaimed film stars Ethan Hawke as a troubled pastor and Amanda Seyfried as a parishioner who comes to him for help. Opening in four locations, First Reformed posted a solid per-screen average of roughly 25,067 upon grossing 100,270. Days after its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Focus Features' documentary Pope Francis — A Man of His Word debuted in 346 cinemas in select markets across the U.S., grossing 480,000 for a per-screen average of 1,369. That wasn't enough to match another doc about a revered public figure — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — as RBG earned 1.3 million from 375 cinemas in its third outing for a domestic total of 3.9 million. Magnolia and Participant Media partnered on the film's release. A 70mm cut of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey scored the top location average of any film in a special engagement in four theaters. The special 50th anniversary screening, engineered by Warner Bros. with the help of Christopher Nolan, grossed 200,000 for a per-screen average of 50,000. While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on Saturday was a big draw on television, a special viewing in theaters couldn't boast the same. According to early estimates, Fathom's The Royal Wedding grossed roughly 54,000 from 194 theaters for an average of 278.

To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"He understood in Georgia there was a shortage of legal aid lawyers for the poor\\" correctly answer the question \\"What problem did Barnes understand before becoming governor?\\"? Pick from: + no; + yes;","completion":"+ yes; Before becoming governor, Roy Barnes understood there was a shortage of legal aid lawyers for the poor in Georgia. His decision to work as a full-time, pro-bono lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society demonstrates his commitment to the underserved and the accessibility of legal services for the less fortunate. The numbers reported in the passage reveal the stark reality of the situation in Georgia, with only one legal aid lawyer available for every 10,500 eligible poor people. This scarcity of representation was something Barnes recognized and had actively contributed to addressing during his time in private practice. His experience handling pro-bono cases and volunteering at the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society showed that Barnes was well aware of the systemic problem long before he assumed public office. His notable work in securing a 115 million judgment against Fleet Finance for their predatory lending mortgage practices that largely affected vulnerable homeowners, many of whom were senior citizens, illustrates his dedication to fighting injustice and advocating for equal access to legal representation. The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is a widespread issue, and Barnes' decision to return to legal aid work after his time as governor garnered media attention, shedding light on the ongoing struggle to ensure equal access to justice for millions of Americans who cannot afford proper legal representation. Unfortunately, despite the requirement for all practicing lawyers to promote justice and the inclusion of ethical rules in every state's guidelines, the percentage of pro-bono service remains low. In Georgia, only 23% of the state's active lawyers reported reaching the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. Taking these statistics into account, it becomes evident that Barnes had a clear understanding of the problem at hand—the shortage of legal aid lawyers for the poor in Georgia—prior to his time as governor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can also freehand the design if you're confident with your painting skills. 5. Shake the acrylic glass paint bottles well before use. If using multiple colors, plan the order in which they will be applied to avoid color mixing and smudging. 6. Apply the acrylic glass paint carefully, following the lines of your design. Use thin, even layers while avoiding heavy application, which can take longer to dry or cause unevenness. 7. Allow the paint to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, similar to drying times for a canvas. Do not attempt to cure the paint unless the product's guidelines explicitly mention this step. 8. After the paint dries, carefully remove any pencil markings or stencils if used. 9. When cleaning the painted glass or cup, avoid using a scrub brush as it may wear down the paint over time. Instead, gently hand-wash the item with a soft cloth.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: One of the more enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema (or, indeed, most anything done outside these holier-than-thou United States) are the permutations that crop up. In post-World War Two Japanese manga (comics), for instance, are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects, many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion. The same thing happens in genre film-making, as well; though, again, I'm referring to movies made outside the U.. (where we're just too \\"sophisticated\\" in our close-mindedness to appreciate anything that isn't about or by US). Would an American company, for instance, back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler (El Santo) or a werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a real-life martial artist (Bruce Lee)...? As for television: forget it. While I still love the KUNG FU series that starred the late David Carradine, I've always felt that the Americanized version of Asian martial arts was- how to put it kindly- a bit lacking. To this very day, there hasn't been a pay-per-view channel to feature Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia. (There are lots of soft-core porn masquerading as entertainment shows, but the so-called Action Channel, for instance, has yet to import or to produce a True Martial Arts teleseries.) Before Brother Cadfile was investigating murders on the BBC, there was, of all things, at least one Kung Fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery: THE 5 DEADLY VENOMS. In its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit (western, cop show, etc.), this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work. It's now available from Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and the DVD commentary by Bey Logan is EXACTLY the kind of intelligent, thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve. If you're a martial arts movie fan, rejoice: one of the greatest movie genres of all time (specifically, the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s) are getting a long-overdue second life (and greatly appreciated second look) on DVD.","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the review, I will analyze the overall tone and language used by the reviewer. 1. Positive sentiment: The reviewer starts by appreciating the variety and creativity of Asian cinema and manga, stating that these are \\"handled in uniquely imaginative fashion.\\" This shows a positive sentiment towards the content discussed. 2. Negative sentiment: The reviewer criticizes the United States for being \\"holier-than-thou\\" and close-minded. This suggests a negative sentiment towards the contrast being made between the US and Asian cinema industries. 3. Positive sentiment: The reviewer praises the movie \\"The 5 Deadly Venoms\\" describing it as a \\"martial arts masterpiece\\" and a \\"truly superior piece of work.\\" This shows a positive sentiment towards this specific movie. 4.

This statement is focusing on the difficulties faced by Sam Goodman in his childhood. 3. Compare both statements: The original statement talks about the difficulties faced by Xenophanes in his childhood, as expressed through Sam Goodman's biography. The new statement, however, talks about the difficulties faced by Sam Goodman himself in his childhood, through the same biography. 4. Determine if the statement follows: The new statement does not follow the original statement, as instead of talking about Xenophanes' childhood, it is talking about Sam Goodman's childhood. The biography could offer a vivid sense of the difficulties faced by Xenophanes as a Spartan general, but it does not automatically mean that it will do the same for Sam Goodman's childhood experiences. Based on this analysis, it does not follow that \\"Sam Goodman's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties Goodman faced in his childhood.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a herd of zebras together in a savannah.","completion":"In the given sentence, the most important words are \\"herd,\\" \\"zebras,\\" \\"together,\\" and \\"savannah.\\" 1. \\"herd\\": The word \\"herd\\" is important because it signifies a group of animals, in this case, zebras, which tells us that the subject of the sentence is a collective of animals sharing similar characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, this indicates that the focus of the sentence is on the social aspect of these animals in terms of how they form groups to fulfill their needs, such as finding food, seeking protection, or reproducing. 2. \\"zebras\\": The word \\"zebras\\" specifically identifies which animals are present within this herd. It plays a crucial role in understanding the topic and setting the context for further analysis. The choice of species is important since different animals have their own behaviors, appearances, and habitats. Consequently, zebras, as a species, provide a sense of the environment (savannah) and the social structure (herd behavior) essential for the visual and ecological understanding of the scene. 3. \\"together\\": The word \\"together\\" highlights the coexistence and interaction of the zebras within the herd. It implies that there is a collective behavior among these animals as they share the same space and engage in activities as a group. This allows the reader to infer why these particular animals might be together, such as for safety against predators or to find food more efficiently. Understanding this aspect of the sentence deepens the reader's appreciation of the social dynamics and behaviors of the zebras in their natural habitat. 4. \\"savannah\\": The word \\"savannah\\" establishes the setting in which this herd of zebras is found. This provides valuable information regarding their natural habitat and environmental conditions. The savannah is a tropical grassland ecosystem consisting of mixed tree and grass cover, often associated with African wildlife. Mentioning the savannah not only creates a vivid image for the reader but also helps to link the zebras' collective behavior to broader ecological factors and adaptations necessary for survival in their specific environment. In conclusion, the importance of these words lies in their ability to effectively convey key elements in the sentence, such as the subject (herd of zebras), context (together), and setting (savannah). These words enable the reader to grasp the meaning of the sentence while painting a comprehensive picture of the scene described."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Witness for the Prosecution Movie plot: A few years after War War II, in London, Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), is accused of murdering a rich widow, Emily French (Norma Varden), who has bequeathed him a substantial sum of money.Sir Wilfred Robarts (Charles Laughton), a skilled lawyer who has recently been ill, is asked to defend Vole. Sir Wilfred's doctor has instructed him to avoid excitement. After his hand-picked replacement barrister expresses doubt over Vole's innocence, Sir Wilfred decides to handle the case himself, despite protests from his nurse (Elsa Lanchester) and doctor.After a conversation with Mrs. Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich), Sir Wilfred decides not to call on her to testify in defense of her husband.In the courtroom, Christine Vole surprisingly appears as a Witness for the Prosecution. A parade of circumstantial evidence points to murder. Christine's testimony does not provide an alibi for her husband.All seems lost as the defense concludes its case. But a late night phone call reveals new evidence that Christine wrote letters to her lover about denying her husband an alibi. This evidence changes the jury's opinion and Leonard is acquitted. However, Sir Wilfred suspects something is amiss with this sudden reversal and dramatic evidence.All is revealed in the last dramatic court scene, as Christine admits to deliberately sabotaging her own testimony with the letters, to get her guilty husband freed. But in the penultimate twist, Leonard shows his true stripes and reveals his intention to leave his \\"wife\\" for a younger woman.

But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. What is the main reason for the South China tiger becoming one of the world's top ten most endangered species? A) Because it has lost its natural instincts. B) Because there is not a complete eco-chain. C) Because there is no space for it. D) Because of uncontrolled hunting and destroyed its natural living conditions.

The song is by the American rock band Steely Dan, which was formed by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Elliot Randall was not a member of Steely Dan but was brought in as a session musician for the recording of the song. His solo on \\"Reeling in the Years\\" has become one of the most famous and highly regarded guitar solos in rock music history. The impressive solo is often praised for its unique melodic structure, precision, and technical prowess. The story behind Randall's involvement with Steely Dan is quite interesting. One of the members of Steely Dan, Denny Dias, was a mutual friend of Randall and invited him to the session. Initially, Randall came into the studio to help with some equipment, but Dias and producer Gary Katz suggested he give the solo a try. Randall recorded the now-famous solo in just one take, which ultimately made it into the final version of the song. It was also Dias who played the rhythm guitar on the track, with a distinctive staccato style, providing the perfect foundation for Randall's solo. Over time, the popularity and recognition of the guitar solo on \\"Reeling in the Years\\" have continued to grow. Many musicians and critics have praised Elliot Randall's performance, making it a benchmark for aspiring guitarists and an iconic piece of rock history.

Greek flags are seen decorating the facade of a central Athens hotel the day after celebrations marking Greece's Independence Day March 26, 2015. Greece's economy minister said on Thursday he believed the government would reach a deal with its euro zone peers on planned... ATHENS Greece's deputy finance minister said on Monday Germany owes Greece nearly 279 billion euros (204.98 billion pounds) in reparations for the Nazi occupation of the country. Greek governments and also private citizens have pushed for war damages from Germany for decades but the Greek government has never officially quantified its reparation claims. A parliamentary panel set up by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's government started work last week, seeking to claim German debts, including war reparations, as well as the repayment of a so-called occupation loan that Nazi Germany forced the Bank of Greece to make and the return of stolen archaeological treasures. Speaking at parliamentary committee, Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said Berlin owed Athens 278.7 billion euros, according to calculations by the country's General Accounting Office. The occupation loan amounts to 10.3 billion euros. The campaign for compensation has gained momentum in the past few years as Greeks have suffered hardship under austerity measures imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for bailouts totalling 240 billion euros to save Greece from bankruptcy. Tsipras has frequently blamed Germany for the hardship stemming from the imposition of austerity. He has angered Berlin by threatening to push for reparations in the middle of talks to unlock aid for Greece. Germany has repeatedly rejected Greece's claims and says it has honoured its obligations, including a 115 million deutschmark payment to Greece in 1960. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris. Editing by Jane Merriman) ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Tsipras honoured Greek resistance fighters who were executed by Nazi occupation forces The Greek government says Germany owes Greece nearly €279bn (£204bn; 303bn) in war reparations for the Nazi occupation during World War Two. It is the first time Greece has officially calculated what Germany allegedly owes it for Nazi atrocities and looting during the 1940s. However, the German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. Greece's radical left Syriza government is making the claim while struggling to meet massive debt repayment deadlines. Reacting to the Greek claim, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was \\"dumb\\" to link Greece's bailout by the eurozone with the question of war reparations. \\"To be honest I think it's dumb. I think that it doesn't move us forward one millimetre on the question of stabilising Greece,\\" he said. He said ordinary Greek citizens however deserved \\"huge respect\\" for their economic sacrifices under the bailout programme. The Greek elite had \\"plundered\\" the country, he complained. 'Legally closed' Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. The new figure given by Greek Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas includes €10.3bn for an occupation loan that the Nazis forced the Bank of Greece to pay. \\"According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,\\" Mr Mardas told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece's debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece's state general accounting office. Image copyright German Federal Archives Image caption Greece was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941 - here German soldiers raise their flag over the Acropolis Berlin paid 115m Deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation - a fraction of the Greek demand. Greece says it did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990, before Germany reunified. The budget spokesman for Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democrats, Eckhardt Rehberg, reiterated on Tuesday that \\"the reparations issue is for us closed, politically and legally - the same applies to the so-called forced loan\\". Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for Greek citizens' hardship under the austerity imposed by international lenders. Mr Tsipras is trying to renegotiate the €240bn EU-IMF bailout that saved Greece from bankruptcy. Greece has not received bailout funds since August last year, as the lenders are dissatisfied with the pace of Greek reforms. A Greek repayment of €448m to the International Monetary Fund is due this Thursday. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has said that Greece \\"intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum\\". ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A long time ago, there was a big and terrible war around the world.

Please answer the following question: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. Which reservior would most likely have excellent water quality, reservoir A or reservoir B? Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","completion":"Based on the given information and hint, we can break down the reasoning as follows: 1. Both reservoirs have a seasonal water level that is lowered in the winter by around 10 feet. 2.

Reservoir A has an engineer who has let the water out in the fall, following the seasonal pattern. 4. Reservoir B does not have an engineer this year to regulate the water release, so there is no one to let the water out in the fall. 5.

However, there might be some indirect impacts on the process due to the aggravated lava chambers. Let's look at each potential perturbation and analyze its outcome in this scenario: - Directly impacting a step of the process: Unlikely. The process of taking in air, oxygenating blood, and releasing carbon dioxide is conducted internally within our bodies. Volcanic activity or lava chamber pressure build-up would not directly interfere with or alter the biological mechanisms responsible for these actions. - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Possible. An aggravated lava chamber could lead to a volcanic eruption, which may release a significant amount of volcanic ash, gases, and particulate matter into the atmosphere. Some of these compounds, such as sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases, can have negative impacts on air quality and human respiratory health. When these particles and gases are inhaled, they may irritate the respiratory system and hinder the process of absorbing oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the increased particulate matter in the air could potentially make oxygen less accessible and force the respiratory system to work harder, leading to an increased demand for oxygen in the body. While this effect is indirect, it could still have a noticeable impact on the overall efficiency of the oxygenation process. - Not impacting any step of the process: Possible, but unlikely. While the oxygenation process itself may not be directly impacted by volcanic activity or pressure build-up in lava chambers, it would be rare for there to be no connection between the two at all, especially in the case of an eruption. The indirect impact of a volcanic eruption on overall air quality and human respiratory health would make it harder to argue that there is no impact whatsoever. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation related to aggravated lava chambers and pressure build-up would most likely be indirectly impacting a step of the oxygenation process. This impact could stem from the release of volcanic ash, gases, and particulate matter into the atmosphere, which may irritate the respiratory system and hinder the absorption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide. It is essential to consider the wider environmental and health implications of volcanic activity and its potential effects on overall respiratory efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Decide on an eye-catching halo.","completion":"Title: Crafting the Ultimate Angel Costume: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction When it comes to the enchantment of dressing up for Halloween or costume parties - or transforming into heavenly beings for theatrical performances - few things can capture the imagination quite like donning an ethereal angel costume. Here, we delve into the art of creating the perfect angel ensemble, breaking down all the necessary elements to ensure that you soar as a celestial being. From choosing a light-colored gown or long t-shirt to selecting perfect wings and deciding on an eye-catching halo, we've got you covered. 1. Selecting the Ideal Base: Light-Colored Gown or Long T-Shirt The foundation of an exceptional angel costume is vital, and it begins with selecting your ensemble's base attire. Opting for a light-colored gown or a long t-shirt serves as the appropriate canvas to evoke a transcendent aura. • Light-Colored Gown: When choosing a gown, search for flowing fabrics such as chiffon or silk to create a cascading appearance. Stick to lighter shades like white, ecru, or silver to represent purity and light. Long, loose sleeves or angel-sleeve designs amplify the otherworldly appeal. Additionally, consider the length of the gown; a floor-length skirt with a subtle train creates a delicate yet dramatic effect. • Long T-shirt: A more casual, budget-friendly option is utilizing a long t-shirt as your base. Extra-large, knee-length t-shirts in light shades of white, cream, or pastel colors retain the ethereal aesthetic. To make the t-shirt appear more robe-like, you can gather fabric at the back or cinch the waist with a decorative sash or belt. 2. Choosing the Perfect Wings One of the most iconic aspects of an angel costume is the wings. While considering the size, color, and material composition, you must find a pair that complements your gown or t-shirt and doesn't overwhelm your entire ensemble. • Size: Decide between large, sweeping wings for a more striking appearance or smaller, delicate wings for a subtle, celestial charm. • Color: Coordinate the wing color with your base attire - white, silver, or gold are all suitable choices. Some may prefer iridescent or glittery wings for added shimmer and glitz. • Material: Feathered wings can lend an organic, authentic feel to your costume, whereas wire-framed wings with translucent fabric can offer a more fantastical aesthetic. Consider the weight of the wings, ensuring that they are comfortable to wear throughout the event. 3. Deciding on an Eye-Catching Halo No angel costume is complete without the quintessential halo. The perfect halo should look heavenly, yet not distract from the overall outfit. • Material: The halo can be crafted from a variety of materials such as wire, tinsel, or floral accents. Wire halo with beads or crystals provides a minimalist but captivating effect, while tinsel or garland halos can add a touch of sparkle and playfulness. • Attachment: Consider how the halo will be secured to your head. Options include a headband-style attachment, which typically offers a comfortable fit and stable positioning, or attaching the halo to clips or hair combs to nestle seamlessly into your hairstyle. • Additional Embellishments: To elevate your halo, you can adorn it with flowers, ribbon, pearls, or other costume jewels. Coordinate these embellishments with the other aspects of your costume to ensure a cohesive and mesmerizing appearance. Conclusion Pulling off the ultimate angel costume is within your grasp by carefully selecting the ideal base, wings, and halo. By committing attention to detail and focusing on color, material, and style, your celestial transformation will leave an impression that no one will soon forget. Step into your divine role as an angel and make a heavenly statement at any event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

Diaz-Canel, at the age of 57, was the only candidate for the presidential position and has won a five-year term, according to state media. While the appointment of Diaz-Canel as the president of Cuba may not lead to drastic change, his promise to continue the Castros' socialist revolution signifies the faith he has in the political ideologies of his predecessors. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel stated. As a former first vice president, Diaz-Canel is considered to be socially liberal, making him an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who were part of the revolution. Diaz-Canel is succeeding 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after serving 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel Castro, played a significant role in the Cuban political landscape as he served as prime minister and president following the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959. However, his reign ended in 2006 due to health issues. Though the leadership transition is bringing younger leaders like Diaz-Canel to the forefront, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, predominantly because of their stronghold on the Communist Party. As Castro remains the party leader, Diaz-Canel is quoted as saying, \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country.\\" He also emphasized that \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.\\" Castro informed the members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two terms as president and is likely to succeed him as the head of the Communist Party eventually. As the new president of Cuba, Diaz-Canel will face the challenge of improving the country's economic state and bringing prosperity to its Caribbean nation. The present condition of the Cuban economy is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was backed by the former Soviet Union. In conclusion, Miguel Diaz-Canel is excited to take on the role of President of Cuba, succeeding Raul Castro, and is committed to leading the country by continuing the revolutionary principles and socialist vision of the Castros."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Nick Clegg said Lib Dems would pursue higher ratio of tax rises to cuts. Would involve ‘at least’ £8billion in tax rise in shift towards Labour position. David Cameron condemned the move, saying it would hit ordinary families.","completion":"Title: Nick Clegg's Announcement For Higher Tax Rises, A Shift Towards Labour Position, Sparks Reactions From David Cameron Introduction: The political landscape in the United Kingdom has once again stirred up conversations as the Liberal Democrats' (Lib Dems) leader, Nick Clegg, announces intentions to pursue higher tax rises to fund public services. As the British public looks to the upcoming party manifestos for each of the parties, there seem to be a shift in the Lib Dems’ stance, inching closer to the Labour party's position on taxes. Body: Nick Clegg’s statement on pursuing a higher ratio of tax rises to cuts essentially proposes increasing taxes by ‘at least’ £8 billion. This move is aimed at bolstering public services and reducing the country's deficit. Clegg's planned policy appears to align his party with the Labour party, staking a claim in solidarity against austerity measures that have been previously enforced by the coalition government led by the Conservatives. The Lib Dems’ announcement represents an ideological shift toward the center-left, particularly in terms of their economic policies. Traditionally, the Lib Dems have championed a more centrist position; however, this proposed tax rise seems to gravitate toward Labour's stance on taxation and public spending. Speculation suggests that this tactical move may likely be a response to the upcoming general elections, as parties are fine-tuning their political messaging in hope of garnering voter support. However, this proposed tax rise has sparked fierce condemnation from the Conservative Party, specifically their leader David Cameron. He criticized the Lib Dems' proposal, arguing that such a plan would adversely impact ordinary hardworking families in the UK. Cameron's denunciation of Clegg's tax plan signifies that the Conservatives remain committed to their stance on lowering the tax burden and promoting fiscal responsibility. Furthermore, Cameron's disapproval appears to align with the belief that increasing the tax burden on working families during the ongoing recovery from the financial crisis would pose a significant strain on their financial stability. The Conservatives’ concerns over the potential negative consequences of raising taxes seem to underline their core belief in maintaining a competitive business environment, reducing the fiscal burden on working families, and keeping public finances in check. Conclusion: As the UK's political parties gear up for the upcoming general elections, economic policies and party positions are coming under scrutiny. Nick Clegg’s announcement to pursue higher tax rises and aligning Lib Dems closer to the Labour party’s stance has raised eyebrows and invited criticism from political opponents. With David Cameron condemning this proposal, stating that it would harm ordinary families, the ensuing political debate becomes a key reflection of each parties' vision for the country's economic future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed.

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Which city released less livestock waste into the ocean? A:","completion":"To determine which city, Bird city or Pine city, released less livestock waste into the ocean, we must examine their economic practices and geographical locations more closely. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. This means that any waste, including livestock, from the city has a direct route to the ocean through the river. The city relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Conventional agriculture often involves raising large numbers of livestock for food production. The waste generated from these livestock operations usually includes manure and urine. When not managed properly, these waste materials can leak into nearby waterways, eventually reaching the sea. In Bird city, the likelihood of livestock waste reaching the ocean is increased due to its proximity to the river. The use of fertilizers for crops can also contribute to water pollution, as excessive nutrient runoff from fields may reach and contaminate the river. On the other hand, Pine city was located in the mountains and inhabited by nature lovers and people who protected the environment. While the statement doesn't provide information on the specific economic activities of Pine city, it might be reasonable to assume they practiced sustainable agriculture and eco-friendly activities, given their love for the environment. Sustainable agriculture often involves fewer livestock operations and focuses on preserving natural resources, which would contribute to less waste generation. Furthermore, Pine city's mountainous location creates a larger buffer between the livestock waste and the sea, as waste materials would have to travel down the mountain to reach the ocean, lesser the chance of livestock waste reaching the ocean. Given the nature of economic activities and geographical locations of Bird city and Pine city, it can be inferred that Pine city likely releases less livestock waste into the ocean. This conclusion is based on their commitment to environmental protection and sustainable practices as well as their longer distance from the sea. However, it is crucial to consider that making accurate assumptions about both these cities would require more information about each city's specific agricultural practices and waste management systems."},{"prompt":"What is the last name of the person who had several siblings? Answer the above question based on the context below: Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

News article: HARPURSVILLE, NY (WCMH) – A New York petting zoo is sharing the joy as they are expecting a baby giraffe to be born. The Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York is live-streaming as their 15-year-old giraffe, April and her mate, Oliver welcome their baby. The livestream has gained international attention, with several hashtags trending such as #AprilsViewCrew, #TeamEgg and #GiraffeWatch. Saturday, April 8, The Keeper and Vet said there hadn’t been much change but said that’s a good thing! All is well on the giraffe front! April keeps us waiting. Keeper and vet reports today have no remarkable change. Though this may seem redundant – it’s actually a good thing! Full udders, huge belly, mom ready – we just need the labor process to begin – so we are waiting for that final stage. Temperatures will climb tomorrow and then we are off to a beautiful week! Late Saturday, April 1, The Animal Adventure Park said it looked like an April Fool’s Day baby wasn’t the case, but we could see a new baby giraffe any time after midnight! April continues to ignore her grain, zones in and out of awareness, exhibits soft contraction indications, and is even producing manure size and consistency hinting of a birth – though we are not yet in what we will call “active labor”. Our big girl is comfortable, confident, and continues to keep her composure – better than the rest of us! However, as of Tuesday morning, we are still waiting for April. “April has remained off grain again today, toys with her hay, turns up her nose at lettuce, but likes a DR Tim Carrot Treat! Tonight will be another long night as we wait for April to decide just when is right!” Over the weekend, the park’s vet posted the following information on their Facebook page. So the timeline for my 24-48 hour prediction is rapidly coming to an end… not surprising is the fact that we still have no calf and we still don’t have a giraffe in Labor! Pretty much all of her clinical signs from a couple days ago are still true. She just isn’t quite ready to give the world what it wants. To answer a few question I have seen on the web in various places: no, she isn’t late; no, she isn’t overdue; no, I’m not concerned she is “taking so long”, nor should you be. Yes she remains happy and comfortable (considering the circumstances). Yes, she will have this calf when she is good and ready. No, public outcry won’t change that. No, I cannot induce her, nor should we want to… (those are human constructs which don’t apply to large wild animals and only endanger the life of April and her calf )Yes, it will be awesome when the calf arrives. No, watching after April is not my only job. Yes, we have been watching her for a very long time… enjoy the <free> show people. Get more popcorn. On Monday, March 20, April’s zookeepers reported that the calf has been moving and sticking out. A photo accompanied the update on the Animal Adventure Park’s Facebook page. In the photo, you can see a definite lump on April’s round side. “Keeper report is “holy smokes” baby is sticking out. It is very evident in visual observations that the calf is moving up and sticking out! All are happy with progress, we are not in labor at this time,” said the Facebook post. On Tuesday, March 14, April’s zookeepers reported that the baby was very active. A blizzard brought a lot of snow to the Harpursville, NY area where the zoo is located. On Sunday, March 12, zoo officials said there was significant movement from the baby in April’s belly. On Monday, March 6, April’s belly appeared to be larger and she was stealing hay from her mate, Oliver. On Tuesday, Feb. 28, April and her mate Oliver got to spend time together outside. The park reports that there is not much change in April’s physical appearance. She is carrying the baby a bit higher and tighter. On Monday, Feb. 27, the park said that April is not yet labor. April’s condition remains the same. Her baby continues to move and the baby’s kicks are noticeably obvious. April laid down for a while, which helps her get the calf get into a more comfortable position. April will likely get to go outside on Monday because temperatures are warming up a bit. The park shared an adorable photo on Facebook that showed the first time that Oliver and April met, which was about 1 & 1/2 years ago. Jordan Patch, the owner of the park told Spectrum News that April is in the last stage of her pregnancy. Giraffes have a 15-month gestation period, and April’s tentative due date was mid-February, Patch said. But active labor could still be days away. “Giraffes hide their signs as a natural instinct, that is why until we see hooves we will not announce active labor,” Patch told NBC4. “Process can take a few hours or a day or so — once hooves appear it will be 60 minutes before it’s out and on the ground. It’s a very natural process, and we can’t put timelines on that.” READ MORE: The difference between labor in humans and giraffes When the baby is born it will likely stand around six feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds. The mother and father are still getting to enjoy yard time, but the park is now keeping them separated due to April’s condition. “His rambunctious play for an extended period could have negative effects. Boys will be boys,” the park said. On Wednesday, Feb 22, the park says animal rights activists convinced YouTube to pull the live feed “for violating YouTube’s policy on nudity or sexual content.” The park then issued the following statement on its Facebook page. Just after 9:00am Thursday morning on February 23, the feed was back up on YouTube after an appeal. According to CNBC, giraffe populations have been rapidly decimated across Africa and the species is threatened with extinction. Giraffes were moved from Least Concern list to the Vulnerable list by the IUCN due to a dramatic 36-40% decline from approximately 151,702-163,452 individuals in 1985 to 97,562 in 2015. The group cited Illegal hunting, habitat loss and changes through expanding agriculture and mining, increasing human-wildlife conflict, and civil unrest as reasons pushing the species towards extinction. Of the nine subspecies of giraffe, three have increasing populations, whilst five have decreasing populations and one is stable, according to the IUCN. Patch told Spectrum News that he believes the giraffe born at the Animal Adventure Park will be important for the continued viability of the species.

We take pride in our indoor housing and the level of enrichment and care to keep them happy and healthy. The calf will weigh around 150lb and will be about 6' tall at birth. The front hooves will come out first followed by the snout. Mom will naturally raise the calf, with weaning could take between 6-10 months, maybe longer. We will not rush this process – it is just a documented range of captive weaning. Once the calf is born, we will have a contest to name it. The keepers will go in with April, clean her pen, give her treats (but not Oliver). He is a bull - and a bull is a bull is a bull! Giraffes are pregnant for 15 months Upon naturally weaning, the calf will move on to another facility to start a breeding program there. We cannot retain offspring, as it would lead to incestuous mating and undermine the genetics of the program and species. Those \\"things\\" on their heads are called ossicones. Bulls (male giraffes) only really care about two things- fighting and the unmentionable.... Oliver may share space with April, but for short periods. Bulls take no part in rearing young. They eat hay and specialized giraffe diet but love romaine lettuce and carrot treats. April's water source, enrichment, and solo hay feeder are out of sight of the camera view.

Which attack helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite is currently under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft? Answer:","completion":"The attack helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite that is currently under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft is the AH-64 Apache. The AH-64 Apache is a twin-engine, multi-mission attack helicopter developed by the United States Army and used by various countries globally. The Apache was first introduced in 1986 and has since become one of the primary attack helicopters in various militaries, including the United States, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The helicopter is designed to provide firepower and versatility during combat missions. It is often deployed for close air support, armed reconnaissance, and as anti-tank and anti-armor platforms. One crucial feature of the AH-64 Apache is its nose-mounted sensor suite, known as the Target Acquisition Designation Sight, Pilot Night Vision System (TADS/PNVS). This advanced system enables the Apache to navigate and engage targets in low-light or adverse weather conditions, providing it with an edge over other attack helicopters. The TADS/PNVS consists of a number of sensors and systems, including a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera, a Day TV camera, a direct-view optical sight, a laser rangefinder/designator, and a laser spot tracker. These components together allow the Apache's pilots to detect, identify, and engage targets at extended ranges and in various lighting and environmental conditions. In addition to the TADS/PNVS, the Apache is armed with a suite of powerful weapons, including a 30mm M230 chain gun, Hellfire missiles, and Hydra 70 rocket pods. These weapon systems make it a formidable aircraft capable of taking on a range of targets, including tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, and other aircraft. In summary, the AH-64 Apache is the attack helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite that is currently under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft. Its combination of advanced technologies, weapons, and survivability make it a critical asset in modern warfare and a vital part of the US Army and other armed forces worldwide."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side, has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude. Which township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena? Hint: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. A:","completion":"Jolt township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena compared to Burr township. The reason for this difference lies in their altitude and environmental conditions. Burr township, being on the western side and at a lower altitude, experiences more atmospheric convection. Lower altitudes generally have warmer air which rises due to its buoyancy and the presence of temperature differences within the layers of the atmosphere causing instability. This leads to cumulus cloud formation, increased winds, and potentially severe weather events like thunderstorms, hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. On the other hand, Jolt township is situated on the eastern side at a higher altitude and has a less windy and less cloudy environment. Higher altitudes typically have cooler and more stable air masses, reducing the chances of atmospheric convection. The air at higher altitudes does not rise as much as in low altitudes because it is already cooler and more stable, leading to fewer instances of severe weather phenomena.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA.

It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champion (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of each UEFA national association. The final of the 201213 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.

They spend hours together every day. But in a lab, chimpanzees are put in cages alone. There are no families, only cold, hard cages, and loneliness that goes on for so many years that most of them lose their minds at last. Worse yet are the experiments.

Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Process: - A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - The electrical current flows through the wire - The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is not much copper available happens, how will it affect there will be a smaller electrical source produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if there is not much copper available, there will be a smaller electrical source produced. To assess the effect of this change on the process, let's look at each step in the process and consider changes caused by the perturbation. Step 1: A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - Perturbation effect: With less copper available, either the wire is made smaller, the wire will be thinner or a less efficient conducting material may be used as a substitute. Step 2: An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - Perturbation effect: A smaller electrical source is produced, which means lower electric current. Step 3: The electrical current flows through the wire - Perturbation effect: With a smaller electrical source, there will be less electrical current flowing through the wire. If the wire is thinner or a less efficient conductor is used, the current flow may be further reduced due to higher resistance. Step 4: The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - Perturbation effect: Since the electrical current is reduced due to the smaller electrical source and possible increased resistance, the strength of the magnetic field generated will be weaker than it would be with the original amount of copper and electrical source. Step 5: The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source - Perturbation effect: This step is not directly affected by the perturbation, as the functionality of turning the magnetic field on and off remains the same. However, due to the weaker magnetic field generated, the overall effect of turning on and off may be less pronounced. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have indirect effects on the process. The decreased availability of copper and subsequent reduction in the electrical source lowers the electric current, resulting in a weaker magnetic field. This ultimately impacts the effectiveness of the magnetization process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. and the situation: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. Answer the following question: If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, are they closer or farther? A:","completion":"If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, they are farther apart. Step 1: Understanding the background The background information clearly states that electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field, and when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. Step 2: Similarity between the situation and background In the given situation, David observed negative charges (like charge A and charge B) moving from electric field C to electric field D. This movement happens spontaneously from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy. Step 3: Movement of charges The movement of the charges from a higher to a lower potential energy indicates that the charges are being pushed apart by their mutual repulsion, as explained in the background information. Step 4: Conclusion Given the movement of charges and their decrease in potential energy, we can conclude that charge A and charge B are farther apart when the potential energy between them decreases."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Classify each post into the following categories : AUTHOR (if the author of the post is wrong in the situation), OTHER (if any of the others mentioned in the paragraph is wrong), EVERYBODY (if everyone mentioned is wrong) and NOBODY (if no one is wrong in the situation). Input: My (23/F) boyfriend (26/m) has been extremely busy with work this week. A few times during the year, his job is really high stress and he usually reacts by being distant in our relationship. I understand why, it’s happened before and we’ve talked about it. However, I always worry about him when this happens and he reassures me everything is fine. I think I get on his nerves by always checking in to make sure everything is OK. (Ugh, I know. I’m a worrier, I can’t help it sometimes.) He has plans with his friends this weekend to blow off some steam and chill out with them. So, I was planning on getting some of his favorite booze delivered to his house as a little gift to maybe cheer him up. (We live in a major city, so booze delivery is super easy and I wouldn’t be physically going over there - I’m trying to give him space and let him do his thing.) But, I can’t help but think this would be kind of an asshole move. Like I said, he gets distant when he’s in these stressful periods, so I don’t want to encroach on his space and seem like an overbearing girlfriend. So, am I overthinking this or WIBTA if I got my boyfriend a surprise booze delivery? Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation. Usage: The author's boyfriend is very busy and stressed with work, causing him to become distant in their relationship. The author wants to send her boyfriend some of his favorite booze as a gift to cheer him up. However, she is unsure if it would be an overbearing action. This example meets the criteria because it involves actions that create considerations of social and personal responsibilities, and create questions of right or wrong in the situation. Part #2: Classify each post into the category AUTHOR. Usage: In this situation, the author's intentions seem good and she is genuinely concerned about her boyfriend's well-being. While one might argue that she might be a bit overbearing, it's not completely wrong on her part. Therefore, it does not fit into the AUTHOR category, as the author is not clearly in the wrong. Part #3: Classify each post into the category OTHER. Usage: The boyfriend is busy and stressed with work and might become distant in the relationship because of that. However, this reaction is understandable, and it does not make him wrong in this situation. Thus, the post does not fit into the OTHER category, as the other person is not clearly in the wrong either. Part #4: Classify each post into the category EVERYBODY. Usage: In this case, both the author and her boyfriend may have areas for improvement, but neither are entirely wrong in their actions or intentions. Therefore, the post cannot be classified as EVERYBODY, as both parties are not clearly wrong in the situation. Part #5: Classify each post into the category NOBODY. Usage: Since neither the author nor her boyfriend have acted entirely wrong or with ill-intent, the post should be classified as NOBODY. The author shows genuine concern for her boyfriend, and the boyfriend's distant behavior can be attributed to work stress, which affects relationships on occasion. Therefore, it meets the criteria for the NOBODY category, where no one is wrong in the described situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient's body melting (or disolving or being digested) from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being dissolved by the growing Blob and while trying to free him his arm is torn from his body, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious and the Blob oozes out of the hospital and oozes into a nearby manhole into a sewer.After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police who refuses to belive the teens that something is going on, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman is grabbed and pulled head first through the sink drain by the Blob.

Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757. However, it was not yet able to take Königsberg and retreated soon afterward. Still, it was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men. Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts. Q: What caused the Russians based in Memel to be successful deeper into Prussia?","completion":"The success of the Russians based in Memel in advancing deeper into Prussia can be attributed to several factors: 1. Overwhelming numbers: The Russian army invaded Memel with 75,000 troops, which was a considerable force. This large number of troops allowed them to exert pressure on the Prussian defenses. 2. Effective artillery bombardment: The Russian army used a five-day-long artillery bombardment to weaken the defenses of the strong fortress in Memel. This bombardment likely inflicted significant damage and demoralized the defenders, ultimately allowing the Russians to storm and capture the fortress. 3. Taking advantage of the opportunity: After capturing Memel, the Russians used it as a base to launch further attacks into East Prussia. They defeated a smaller Prussian force at the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757, showcasing their tactical prowess and exploiting Prussia's vulnerabilities. 4. Prussian distractions: At the time, Prussia was fighting on multiple fronts, with King Frederick II being forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia and withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. This stretched Prussian resources and made defending against the Russian advance more difficult. In summary, the Russians based in Memel were successful in advancing deeper into Prussia due to their overwhelming numbers, effective artillery bombardment, tactical maneuvering, and taking advantage of the Prussian distractions on multiple fronts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak. Have to say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things. a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that.

Article: Through history, children have played with toys and they help to prepare children for adult life. But the toys are changing all the time. As science and technology have changed the way adults live, the toys children play with have changed as well. Developments in science and technology have had a big effect on the toys that children play with. Today trains and mobile phones are popular toys for young children, but there were no toys of this kind before real trains and mobile phones were invented. The materials that toys are made of have also changed. Today lots of toys are made of plastic. Plastic is a modern, man-made material that did not exist in the past. On the other hand, some other toys that you have might not be all that different from the ones children played with 1,000 years ago. Scientists have found some bone dice in Aberdeen. In medieval times dice were used for playing games as much as they are today. A recent survey found that half of all the children aged from 4 to 6 have played video games, a quarter of them regularly. The increasing use of electronic toys troubles Dr Singer, a professor at Yale. \\"One thing we know is that kids in early years need to be in touch with the real world,\\" he said, \\"No matter how brilliant they are, they're not going to learn to walk, to move or to talk to others unless their hands or feet have a direct role in such activities.\\" Some toy experts argue that the best toys are the ones that increase a child's creativity and imagination. Traditional toys can be used for different kinds of purposes and be used in group settings, individually , and one-to-one. They are also used differently depending on the child's age and skill level. And these toys made of natural materials are valuable for children because they teach children what the world is made of. Question: From the article, we can know that _ .

Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Falcons flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 7 divisional duel with the New Orleans Saints. Due to QB Joey Harrington's ineffectiveness from last week's loss to the Giants, QB Byron Leftwich was given the start. In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 37-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. The Falcons responded with former Saints kicker Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Atlanta began to play well as Andersen got a 33-yard field goal, while Leftwich completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. In the third quarter, New Orleans retook the lead with RB Pierre Thomas getting a 24-yard TD run. On the Falcons' next possession, Leftwich's left leg got injured during a sack by Saints DE Will Smith. Harrington took over for the rest of the game. In the fourth quarter, Andersen gave Atlanta a 21-yard field goal. The Saints sealed the win with Brees hooking up with RB Reggie Bush on a 4-yard TD pass, along with Bush's 2-point conversion run. With their third-straight loss, the Falcons entered their bye week at 1-6.

Article: As long as you complete the requirements (mostly scientific in nature), you can major in anything you would like. For example, you must take courses in biology, chemistry, and physics to prepare for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and fulfill medical school prerequisites. As a result, many pre-med students major in a field of science. Medical schools are looking to diversify their programs, so they are starting to accept more students with less conventional backgrounds that include degrees in fields such as humanities. As of 2015, you will need the background of one semester of introductory psychology and one semester of introductory sociology to be prepared for the Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section of the MCAT. It is important to have a high GPA in order to be a strong medical school candidate. Whatever major you choose, make your performance in the classroom your main focus. Be an exemplary student. Attend all of your classes each time they meet, schedule lots of time for reading and studying and do not hesitate to get help from another classmate or a tutor the minute you realize you are struggling with any of your subjects. Focus on BCPM. BCPM stands for \\"Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics\\"; these are the core classes for a pre-med major because these courses are prerequisites for any medical school program. Your BCPM grades are greatly important that when you apply to medical school, your scores in these classes will be separated out and an additional GPA will be calculated for these classes alone and reviewed along with your cumulative GPA in all of your classes. Do your best to get to know them and learn if they are accessible to offer guidance or answer questions. In a couple of years, you will need letters of evaluation from individuals who know you and your work, and one of your professors might agree to write such a letter if he or she feels they've made a connection with you. Attend department and informal functions where it might be easier to talk casually and openly with instructors. Look for opportunities to meet alumni who have gone on to medical school or those who are working now as physicians. You can learn a lot about what to expect in medical school by talking to someone who has been there themselves. Plan to get involved in activities both related and unrelated to your major and look for opportunities on and off campus to develop personal, leadership, research, and clinical skills. Be sure to join any health-career clubs on your campus and get on the mailing list so that you will receive notices about events and activities. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Premed Navigator is a helpful monthly newsletter which features important topics, resources, tips, and key dates for aspiring physicians. Approach the campus health clinic to look for volunteer positions there, and, if your school has a research facility, check for opportunities to assist in some way. Go off campus to explore ways to get involved in the local community health center, at health fairs or teaching children about basic health topics. See if a local public school might be looking for candidates to take to kids about health care careers. There is a world of difference from learning the fundamentals in a classroom and practicing those skills with actual patients. You must find ways to get hands-on experience in a health care setting. Reach out to your local Planned Parenthood office, HIV clinic, or free clinic to volunteer. The author of an article that appeared in U.S. News and World Report said several admissions committee members he spoke to referred to clinical experience as \\"the unspoken requirement.\\" The occasional one-time volunteer job is fine, but you want to choose a couple of organizations or causes about which you are passionate and make a regular (once-a-week or once-every-other-week) commitment over a sustained period of time. Seek out under-served populations. Medical schools are not only looking for students with great grades, they want people who are caring and want to make a difference. Working to provide health care and health education to under-served or at-risk populations can help communicate your compassion. Being a physician means being in charge of a lot--diagnosis, treatment, medications, follow-ups and on and on. Hone your skills as a leader by heading up a group or a committee and be sure to set, achieve and record your goals for your organization. Internships for pre-med students typically fall into one of two categories: research or clinical. Decide what most interests you and focus your efforts there. Start with your adviser. Your adviser or health-career services office should have a list of internships available. Many times, schools establish relationships with doctors, hospitals, and health care organizations who, in turn, regularly accept student interns from that school. Apply early. The time to be thinking about summer internships is in the fall of the preceding year. At minimum, start three to four months out, but do not be surprised if there are fewer opportunities available. Be proactive. Talk to older students or alumni to find out about internship sites they would recommend or get and review a list of places that offered internships last summer. Contact those organizations on your own before they post or advertise their upcoming internships for the general pre-med population. While you're busy working on your grades, extracurricular activities and internships, you also need to keep in mind about upcoming requirements and deadlines that are a part of the med school applications process. Get familiar with the AAMC Fee Assistance Program. The AAMC Fee Assistance Program assists those who, without financial assistance, would be unable to take the Medical College Admission Test® (MCAT®), apply to medical schools that use the American Medical College Application Service® (AMCAS®), and more. Learn more about benefits and eligibility here. Take the MCAT junior year. There are two factors to consider when deciding on the timing of your Medical College Admission Test (MCAT): whether you plan to take the exam more than once and how prepared you feel. If you think you might want to take the test more than once, plan to make your first attempt before May 1. This will give you plenty of time to get your scores and make a decision about retesting. Most people do not plan on taking the exam multiple times, and some argue that it will hurt your chances. Like all things in life: if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right the first time. If you don't feel prepared academically or there are elements in your personal life that are making it difficult for you to focus, put your efforts into your coursework and on getting in a good place mentally for the test. It would be perfectly fine if you waited until June or July to take the exam. Even people who take the exam in August can apply that cycle.

The premise suggests that if there are changes in the expected system size, then it might be necessary to reestimate the development costs using specific cost models. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that all of the cost models will show the costs skyrocketing. Step 3: Assess if the hypothesis must follow from the premise.

A confident Mitt Romney has said he feels 'pretty darn good' about his six wins on Super Tuesday, dismissing the narrowness of his Ohio victory over Rick Santorum by insisting he would be the Republican nominee. Appearing on CNBC the morning after he increased his delegate lead and won states from Alaska to Massachusetts with Idaho, Ohio, Virginia and Vermont in between he said he was 'getting the kind of support across the party that I need to become the nominee'. Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee while Newt Gingrich claimed his home state of Georgia but the Romney campaign said that it was a virtual impossibility either could win. On the way: Mitt Romney, who claimed at least 212 delegates on Super Tuesday, believes that he is well on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for president. 'All we have to do is keep doing what. we're doing and we can get to the nomination,' a senior Romney adviser. said. 'Those guys, it's going to take some sort of act of God to get. where they need to be to win the nomination.' As if to confirm that President Barack. Obama believes Romney will be his opponent in November, the Obama. campaign held a press conference call slamming the former Massachusetts. governor. David Axelrod, Obama's top strategist. said that Romney 'grinds out tactical victories in a kind of death. march' and added: 'We tried to appeal to the best of people, and they. appear to be trying to appeal to the worst in people' Though critics argue that he is having. trouble 'sealing the deal' with voters, Romney advisers argue that the. rules for apportionment of delegates make it certain that he will be the. nominee. Romney said: “We will come together. because Barack Obama has organised a conservative community…the. community organiser has organised us in a big way. 'When we have a nominee we will come together because Barack Obama has organized the conservative community. 'We're going to come together because we really believe that he needs to be replaced.' As well as winning more states and. securing more votes, Romney also amassed a clear majority of the more. than 400 delegates at stake. But proportional Republican rules meant he. was several hundred away from the 1,144 needed for the GOP nomination. In the bag? Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann greet supporters as they arrive at their Super Tuesday primary rally in Boston tonight. He now leads the field with 415 delegates with Santorum on 176, Gingrich on 105 and Ron Paul on 47. Romney's His wafer-thin margin of. victory in Ohio underlined doubts about his candidacy and his ability to. connect with low-income voters. Santorum's wins in North Dakota,. Oklahoma and Tennessee gave his shoestring campaign a boost but his poor. campaign organisation was revealed in his failure to secure more. delegates. Kansas is set to vote on Saturday. followed by two Southern states Alabama and Mississippi, where. evangelicals are suspicious of Romney because of his Mormon faith. Santorum is expected to do well in all three contests. Gingrich's win in Georgia was a lone. bright spot in a dismal night for him. He vowed to continue but will. face pressure to drop out so that Santorum can consolidate the. conservative anti-Romney vote, especially if victory eludes him in. Alabama and Mississippi. He told supporters in Georgia: 'There. are lots of bunny rabbits to run through, I am the tortoise. I just take. one step at a time.' Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas. congressman whose uncompromising anti-war stances have meant he never. had a realistic chance of the nomination, failed to win a single state. He is likely to stay in the race for the long haul but is not viewed as a. threat by Romney. The results underlined Romney's. continued inability to win over large swathes of the Republican base,. who view his past as a moderate Massachusetts governor with suspicion. Fighting spirit: Rick Santorum rallied his supporters on Super Tuesday at the Steubenville High School in Ohio - before he lost the state to Mitt Romney. Early success: Newt Gingrich makes his victory speech in Atlanta with wife Callista after he won the state of Georgia. Confident: Rick Santorum kisses his wife after he won in Tennessee and Oklahoma on Super Tuesday. Speaking to supporters in Boston, Romney acknowledged that he had not landed a knockout blow. He said: 'Tonight, we are counting up. the delegates for the convention – and counting down the days until. November. We're going to take your vote and our victory all the way to. the White House.' Romney and his allies spent almost. four times the money on campaigning in Ohio compared to Santorum, with. much of that on negative advertising. Santorum waited until Oklahoma and Tennessee fell into his column before speaking to cheering supporters in Ohio. Santorum told supporters in. Steubenville, Ohio: 'We're going to get at least a couple of gold medals. and a whole passel full of silver medals. 'We've won in the West, the Midwest, in the South and we're going to win across this country.' Romney is worth more than 200 million and has at times struggled to connect with ordinary people. But he honed his message in Ohio,. saying that the 2012 election centred around 'whether the stresses on. families are going to be alleviated, where you've got a mom working the. day shift and a dad working a night shift and the kids not sure who's. home when'. He unveiled a new slogan of 'more jobs, less debt, smaller government' that was as much aimed at Obama as his Republican rivals. Party elders fear that a prolonged race would leave Romney damaged against Obama in the general election. In Ohio, Santorum charged: 'The. underlying problem that I hear when I talk to people all over, they say. they just don't trust Mitt Romney to not do what's the fashionable thing. at the moment.' State Gingrich Paul Romney Santorum reporting. North Dakota 8.5% 28.1% 23.7% 39.7% 100%. Oklahoma 27.5% 9.6% 28.0% 33.8% 100%. Virginia - 40.5% 59.5% - 100%. Ohio 14.6% 9.3% 38.0% 37.0% 99%. Massachusetts 4.6% 9.6% 72.1% 12.1% 98%. Georgia 47.4% 6.5% 25.7% 19.6% 97%. Vermont 8.1% 25.5% 39.8% 23.7% 93%. Idaho 2.1% 17.9% 63.7% 16.2% 91%. Alaska 19.9% 25.4% 31.7% 22.6% 13%.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: General health has improved worldwide, thanks to significant progress against infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria in the past decade and gains in fighting maternal and child illnesses. But healthy life expectancy has not increased as much, so people are living more years with illness and disability, according to the analysis, published in The Lancet journal. “The world has made great progress in health, but now the challenge is to invest in finding more effective ways of preventing or treating the major causes of illness and disability,” said Theo Vos, a professor at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington who led the analysis. The study’s main findings were that global life expectancy at birth for both sexes rose by 6.2 years — from 65.3 in 1990 to 71.5 in 2013. Healthy life expectancy at birth rose by 5.4 years — from 56.9 in 1990 to 62.3 in 2013. Healthy life expectancy takes into account both mortality and the impact of non-fatal conditions and chronic illnesses like heart and lung diseases, diabetes and serious injuries. Those detract from quality of life and impose heavy cost and resources burdens. For most of the 188 countries studied, changes in healthy life expectancy between 1990 and 2013 were “significant and positive”, the researchers said. But in many - among them Belize, Botswana and Syria - healthy life expectancy in 2013 was not much higher than in 1990. And in some, including South Africa, Paraguay, and Belarus, healthy life expectancy has dropped. In Lesotho and Swaziland, people born in 2013 could expect to live some 10 fewer healthy years than people born there 20 years earlier. The study also found stark differences between countries with the highest and lowest healthy life expectancies, and in the rates and direction of change. Nicaraguans and Cambodians have seen dramatic increases since 1990, of 14.7 and 13.9 years respectively. People in Botswana and Belize, however, saw declines of two and 1.3 years respectively. In 2013, Lesotho had the world’s lowest healthy life expectancy, at 42 years. Japan had the highest, at 73.4 years.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Percy Robert Miller was born and raised in New Orleans in the Calliope Projects. He is the oldest out of five children. He has one sister, Germaine, and three brothers: Kevin, and platinum-selling rap artists Corey \\"C-Murder\\" & Vyshonne \\"Silkk The Shocker\\" Miller. He attended Booker T. Washington High School & Warren Easton High School. Since 1997, Master P has been in numerous feature and straight to DVD films, and in television shows. His filmography includes Uncle P, Uncle Willy's Family, Soccer Mom, Gone in 60 Seconds, Toxic, Foolish, and I Got the Hook Up. In 1999, he had a small run in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he led a professional wrestling stable called The No Limit Soldiers in a feud with Curt Hennig's The West Texas Rednecks. Master P also starred in Romeo! alongside his son Romeo Miller on the children's network Nickelodeon from 2003 to 2006. He was also a contestant on Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 2), replacing Romeo who dropped out due to an injury. He partnered with Ashly DelGrosso and received a total score of 8 out of 30 for his pasodoble, the lowest score in the show's history. He was eliminated on Week 4. In 2008, Miller has also made history as the first hip-hop entrepreneur to own a cable television network, Better Black Television (or BBTV011, which was meant to promote positive messages and content to the African American culture). The network was launched in 2009. Executives include Denzel Washington, Derek Anderson of the Charlotte Bobcats, DJ Kool Herc, and Bo Derek. As part of the BBTV project, Miller and Romeo teamed up to develop a children's cartoon titled 'Gee Gee The Giraffe. The show is true to the duo's mission to produce positive, educational, and entertaining content for African-American children. Animation has been employed by the Millers on prior occasions such as their February 2008 cartoon version of their music video for the song \\"Black History.\\" As reported in March 2011, Miller planned to star in a new film with his protege Gucci Mane, titled Get Money. The film, set for release through No Limit, would be based on Miller's book of the same name. On June 10, 2015, it was announced that Master P and his family, would be starring in their own reality show titled Master P's Family Empire.

From there, I reconstructed the sentence following Galician sentence structure, choosing the appropriate Galician words and making sure that the overall meaning of the sentence remained intact. Here's a breakdown of the translation process for each part of the sentence: 1. \\"Podejrzewam\\" means \\"I suspect\\" in Polish. Its Galician equivalent is \\"Sospeito\\". 2. \\"więc\\" means \\"so\\" or \\"then\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"entón\\". 3. \\"że\\" means \\"that\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"que\\". 4. \\"prawdziwy początek\\" means \\"true beginning\\" or \\"true start\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"verdadeiro comezo\\". 5. \\"leży\\" means \\"lies\\" or \\"is located\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"está\\". 6. \\"tam\\" means \\"there\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"alí\\". 7. \\"lub\\" means \\"or\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"ou\\". 8. \\"nawet\\" means \\"even\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"incluso\\". 9. \\"wcześniej\\" means \\"earlier\\" or \\"before\\" in Polish. The Galician equivalent is \\"antes\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then squeeze seam sealer (white glue works in a pinch) into the gap, and press the paper to the wall with a roller. Clean excess sealer with a sponge. This method is the best choice because it allows for a proper reactivation of the paste by using warm water, which helps in achieving better adhesion. By gently widening the gap, there's more space to apply the sealer, ensuring a stronger bond. Using a roller ensures even pressure, which helps in creating a seamless finish, and cleaning excess sealer with a sponge prevents any buildup or residue."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Which came first, University of Erfurt or monastic schools?\\" is in \\"European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century.

It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.

Translate to Finnish: Globalisation is here to stay and international competition is becoming increasingly tough.","completion":"Globalisaatio on tullut jäädäkseen, ja kansainvälinen kilpailu muuttuu yhä kovemmaksi. Globalisaatio tarkoittaa maailmanlaajuista taloudellista, teknologista, sosiaalista ja kulttuurista yhdentymistä. Se on prosessi, jonka ansiosta eri maiden rajat ylittävät toimijat voivat toimia yhä tiiviimmin ja helpommin yhdessä. Tämä johtaa maiden keskinäiseen vuorovaikutukseen ja kohtalaisen yhteisen maailmankäsityksen kehittymiseen. Globalisaatio on prosessina ollut käynnissä jo vuosisatojen ajan, mutta sen nopeus, laajuus ja syvyys ovat lisääntyneet huomattavasti viime vuosikymmeninä. Tähän on vaikuttanut monia tekijöitä, kuten teknologian kehitys, lisääntyvä politiikkojen vapauttaminen, uusliberalistisen talouspolitiikan nousu, pääoman kansainvälistyminen ja kulttuurin leviämisen helpottuminen. Kansainvälinen kilpailu on myös muuttunut yhä kovemmaksi globalisaation seurauksena. Tämä johtuu osittain siitä, että uudet taloudelliset suurvallat, kuten Kiina ja Intia, ovat nousseet haastamaan perinteisiä länsimaita, ja yritykset joutuvat kilpailemaan yhä rajummin keskenään kansainvälisillä markkinoilla. Samalla kansainvälisten sopimusten ja järjestöjen merkitys on kasvanut, ja niiden kautta valtioiden välinen kilpailu on tullut helpommin arvioitavaksi. Vaikka globalisaatio on monin tavoin hyvä asia, se on myös synnyttänyt useita haasteita ja ongelmia. Esimerkkeinä näistä ovat eriarvoisuuden lisääntyminen, ympäristöongelmien laajeneminen, kulttuurien välisten ristiriitojen kärjistyminen ja kansalaisten kokema turvattomuuden tunne. Siksi on tärkeää, että niin yksittäiset maat kuin kansainväliset toimijatkin pyrkivät puuttumaan näihin haasteisiin ja tekemään yhteistyötä kestävän kehityksen ja paremman tulevaisuuden luomiseksi. Lopuksi voidaan todeta, että globalisaatio on nykymaailman todellisuus, joka vaikuttaa yhä enemmän kaikkiin elämän osa-alueisiin. Kansainvälisen kilpailun kiristyminen on yksi tämän prosessin seurauksista, ja siitä selviäminen vaatii sekä tehokasta, innovatiivista toimintaa että yhteistyöhakuisuutta kaikkien toimijoiden kesken. On tärkeää, että ihmiset ja instituutiot sopeutuvat tähän muuttuvaan todellisuuteen ja etsivät tapoja hyödyntää sen tuomia mahdollisuuksia samalla takuulla välttäen sen aiheuttamia uhkia ja riskejä."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, you should avoid posting your location. Online predators look for this type of information, and you don't want them showing up at your social event. Don't use the “check-in” tool on sites like Facebook or Yelp. Keep your personal details secure. Don't post things like your full name, phone number, e-mail address, or physical address. This will make it much harder for any creeps to track you down. When you are filling out an online profile, don't feel like you have to complete all fields. Just fill in the parts that you feel comfortable sharing. Use a different screen name. Instead of your actual name, consider using a nickname or pseudonym. You could be “CubsFan29” or “Katie B.” Online predators are great at being sneaky. Today, we're pretty dependent on technology, and a lot of your data is probably digital. In order to keep your information secure, invest in an anti-virus software for your computer. Make sure to use complicated passwords and update them regularly for more protection. Of course it's nice to know that your family is proud of you. But make sure that mom or dad aren't posting a lot of details every time you get a promotion or buy a home.

In addition, don't use the “check-in” feature on sites such as Facebook or Yelp. Secondly, never share personal information such as your full name, phone number, email address, or physical address. This protects from making it easy for potential predators to track you down. When setting up online profiles, it's not mandatory to complete every field. Only fill in what you are comfortable with sharing publicly. Furthermore, consider using a pseudonym or a nickname as your screen name instead of your real name.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving junior with an insufferable air of self-importance. Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed. Against this backdrop, Tracy announces that she is running for student council president. Initially she is unopposed, as she is widely seen as the natural candidate for the job. When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race.

(Associated Press) Results come in at the watch party for Republican candidate for governor Sam Galeotos at his residence on Tuesday, Aug. 21, 2018, in rural Laramie County, Wyo. (Jacob Byk/The Wyoming Tribune Eagle via AP) (Associated Press) CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — President Donald Trump tried his best to appeal to coal country but, amid a truckload of bad political news, the top coal-producing state didn't love him back. Instead, Wyoming voters chose Secretary of State Mark Gordon, a rancher who grew up at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains, over political mega-donor Foster Friess in the state's Republican primary for governor. Calling Friess \\"Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment,\\" Trump had endorsed Friess on Twitter as voting got underway Tuesday. Trump hours later walked back Obama-era environmental regulations viewed as economic warfare in coal country and told a West Virginia rally that miners were headed back to work. About 40 percent of the nation's coal comes from Wyoming — Trump no doubt got heard out West. Wyoming voters had their own ideas. \\"This is a governor's race. This is about the state of Wyoming,\\" Gordon said after winning his six-way primary. \\"President Trump is doing great things that are important for Wyoming in terms of getting our economy going, and all of that. But in the end, I think people in Wyoming concentrated on who's got the experience, who's got the record and who's got the best message going forward for Wyoming.\\" Trump won Wyoming by the widest margin in 2016, but his support here may be seen as a mile wide and an inch deep. After all, Wyoming Republicans by far preferred another candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination that year. Wyoming could even choose a Democrat again. Attorney and former state Rep. Mary Throne, who was raised on a ranch not far from Gordon's and beat three others to win the Democratic nomination for governor, will be a formidable opponent, Gordon said. \\"Traditionally in Wyoming, we focus on the person and not the party when it comes to electing our governors. And that we like our governors to be independent and thoughtful and all about Wyoming,\\" Throne said Tuesday. The winner will succeed term-limited Gov. Matt Mead. Like Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal, who served two terms before Mead and then on St. Louis-based Arch Coal's board of directors, Throne describes herself as pro-coal. There's no good reason to doubt it. Throne grew up in Campbell County, home to some of the world's biggest open-pit coal mines. While Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and attorney Michael Cohen were convicted of felonies Friday, the president did pick a winner in Wyoming. Trump endorsed Sen. John Barrasso over a wealthy opponent, Jackson Hole business investor Dave Dodson. Delayed by thunderstorms, Barrasso barely made it back to Wyoming from Washington, D.C., in time to hear he'd won the Republican primary. Busy traveling, Barrasso said he had read little about the news involving Trump's associates. He declined comment on how Trump's political and potentially legal fortunes could affect his work with the White House. \\"I go to work every day thinking about the people of Wyoming. Every day I wake up I think about Wyoming, jobs, the economy, how we can make life better for the people of Wyoming. I think that the voters saw that,\\" Barrasso said. Barrasso faces Wilson businessman Gary Trauner in the general election. Trauner, who ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination, ran for the U.S. House twice and came within half a point of beating Republican Rep. Barbara Cubin in 2006. Incumbent Liz Cheney easily won the Republican nomination for Wyoming's lone U.S. House seat. Cheney beat two other Republicans, Blake Stanley of Cheyenne and Rod Miller of Buford. Stanley and Miller both characterized themselves as blue-collar conservatives and ran low-key campaigns. Cheney will run against Laramie businessman Greg Hunter, who beat attorney Travis Helm for the Democratic nomination for U.S. House. ___ Follow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver ||||| To the incredible people of the Great State of Wyoming: Go VOTE TODAY for Foster Friess - He will be a fantastic Governor!

A very impressive staging of suspense and action, whichbegins within the first 20 pages.Granted, the ending is too shortand a little anti-climactic, but realistic from a logical point of view.There was a nice exploration of the characteristics of Ticktock's powers, including the Pause. I laughed out loud when Harry has to employ the use of the breaststroke in a manner he never imagined.......... You'll be reading along about an ordinary scene, and he'll sneak in a semi-casual mention of a threat.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up.

In 2003 Jewel released the album 0304. Following the limited success of \\"Serve the Ego\\", Jewel moved to a more pop-oriented sound with the release of the single \\"Intuition\\". The song reached No. 5 on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart and No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. On May 2, 2006, Jewel released her sixth album Goodbye Alice in Wonderland. The album received mixed reviews, but still managed to debut at No. 8 on the Billboard Albums Chart and sold 82,000 copies in its first week. The lead single \\"Again and Again\\" had success on Adult Top 40 Radio, peaking at No. 16.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let us first analyze the statements provided. Premise: \\"No, there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal\\" The premise given asserts that there is an absence of a feeling of accomplishment and that there is no goal present. This can be interpreted as implying a situation where the individual(s) involved did not experience a sense of achievement or success, and there was no specific objective to be attained. Hypothesis: \\"There was a huge sense of accomplishment\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, presents a contrasting scenario. It asserts that there is a significant feeling of accomplishment. This statement implies a situation where the individual(s) involved experienced a major sense of success, satisfaction, or triumph. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Entailment is the relationship between two sentences or statements when one logically follows or can be deduced from the other. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be necessarily true. There should be no contradiction between the two. In this case, the premise states that there was no feeling of accomplishment and no goal, whereas, the hypothesis posits that there was a huge sense of accomplishment. These statements are contradictory and express opposite scenarios. The premise implies the absence of accomplishment, while the hypothesis suggests the presence of significant accomplishment. Therefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise and hypothesis present conflicting scenarios, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee or necessitate the truth of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:James Fenton, 22, left his ward at the Ulster Hospital in July 2010. His body was found in hospital grounds 10 weeks later, less than 40 metres away. Mr Fenton's grandfather said he climbed a fence to search an area that police officers had not searched. The coroner asked a police superintendent who was giving evidence how trained Tactical Support Group officers failed to carry out a successful search in that area on the same day. The officer observed that a controversial decision had been made to search to \\"a natural boundary\\". Earlier, the superintendent told the inquest the PSNI had changed its policy and practices on missing persons, as a direct result of the case. In 2013 the Police Ombudsman issued a report critical of the way the police had handled the case, and 12 officers were subsequently disciplined. During his evidence, the officer issued an apology to the Fenton family for the way the police had handled the search for James. The inquest also heard on Thursday from an expert in psychiatry that he had concerns about James' care. Giving evidence by video link, Professor Seena Fazel, a forensic psychiatrist at Oxford University, repeated the views of a report he wrote for the Coroner's Office in March 2015, and stated that he had \\"a number of concerns about Mr Fenton's medical care\\". In it, he said he believed that James was likely to have been clinically depressed, that he should have been diagnosed as such on assessment at the ward, and that he should have been monitored more closely. \\"I do not think that placing Mr Fenton on routine observation was an appropriate decision,\\" he said. He also repeated his belief that James most likely took his own life. He further stated he felt that the junior doctor who first assessed Mr Fenton should have discussed her findings and actions formally with senior psychiatric colleagues. She has previously told the court she did have an informal conversation with senior colleagues about what she had done. On Wednesday, two other senior consultant psychiatrists told the court they disagreed with Professor Fazel's conclusions. They were Dr Nial Quigley, the Director of Mental Health services at the South Eastern Trust, and Dr Neta Chada, a consultant psychiatrist at the neighbouring Southern Trust. Both doctors' evidence supported the diagnosis and level of observation chosen by the clinical staff at the Ulster Hospital. Professor Fazel told a barrister for the Fenton family that in one matter, Dr Quigley had \\"cherry-picked a lot of evidence that supported his view\\". Coroner Joe McCriskin is due to deliver his findings on Friday. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"A young man named James Fenton, who was 22 years old, left his hospital ward in 2010. Ten weeks later, his body was found close to the hospital. People are trying to understand how this happened and if the police and the hospital could have done more to help James.

Movie plot: Jesse and Chester awaken with hangovers and no memory of the previous night. The television is on, showing an Animal Planet program about how animals use twigs and rocks as tools to get food. Their refrigerator is filled with containers of chocolate pudding, and the answering machine contains an angry message from their twin girlfriends Wilma and Wanda as to their whereabouts. They emerge from their home to find Jesse's car missing, and with it their girlfriends' one-year anniversary presents.

Stoner comedies can be moderately successful, such as \\"Half Baked\\" (1998) or the \\"Harold & Kumar\\" series (2004-2011). However, they may not necessarily be the high-grossing powerhouse that mainstream comedies or action films can be. Keep in mind that the market demand for this type of movie may have changed since the early 2000s. Next, consider the cast and creative team involved in the project. For example, \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" starred Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott, both of whom were well-known in comedy roles at the time. The involvement of recognizable or talented actors can contribute to a film's success and help draw audiences in. Lastly, weigh the risks and potential rewards associated with investing in a film. The film industry can be unpredictable, but it's essential to strike a balance between potential financial gains and the risks involved. Before committing to any investment in this project, take into account the budget, production quality, marketing strategy, and distribution plan to ensure you are making an informed decision. Overall, it's crucial to thoroughly consider these factors and conduct a thorough analysis of the film proposal before deciding if it's worth investing in. With a better understanding of the various aspects of the movie industry and this particular film, you'll be able to make an informed decision regarding your potential investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the hypothesis, \\"it\\" refers to the same subject, but this time in its absence. Step 2: Consider the logical connections The premise is saying that \\"it\\" is an excellent resource or factor for progress. The hypothesis claims that without \\"it,\\" the country would face regression. We can notice here that the hypothesis is built on an assumption of the inverse of the premise. Step 3: Analyze the consequence of the premise When we assume the premise to be true, we consider that \\"it\\" will help the country make progress. If we focus on the absence of \\"it,\\" we could infer that the situation might be different without \\"it.\\" However, this doesn't necessarily mean that without \\"it,\\" the country would be going backward.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Similar to the problems of defining literature and film, no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium, and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions. Theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images, though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history. Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images. Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task. What has not been reached as far as defining comics is concerned?","completion":"In the field of comic studies, several aspects of defining comics have still not reached consensus, mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of the medium. These aspects include the following: 1. Combination of Text and Images: Early theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove point towards the combination of text and images as a defining feature of comics. However, the existence of pantomime comics, which rely solely on images without any accompanying text, invalidates this theory. Thus, it is still unclear whether a combination of text and images is a necessary attribute for a work to be considered a comic. 2. Primacy of Sequences of Images: Critics like Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud have argued for the primacy of sequences of images, emphasizing the idea that it's the sequencing of images that has significance in defining comics, rather than the use of text. However, this definition can be problematic as it doesn't take into account many comics that heavily rely on text to drive narration and those that may break traditional sequence structures. 3. Cultural Perspectives and New Forms: Given the fact that in the recent past, different cultures have discovered each other's comic traditions and have also rediscovered forgotten forms of early comics, defining the term \\"comics\\" has become even more complex. The introduction of digital comics and graphic novels, for example, has broadened the spectrum of what could be classified as a comic, further complicating the task of defining the medium. 4. The Role of Time: Comics often represent the progression of time across panels, and yet, there isn't a unanimous agreement among theorists on how this element factors into the definition of comics. Some argue it's a crucial attribute, others believe it's merely a byproduct of linear storytelling. In summary, the key factors that still lack consensus when defining comics include the role and necessity of text, the sequencing of images, the cultural and historical evolution of the medium, and the representation and passage of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall)âare the enigma that fill the boys' conversations and dreams. The film opens in the summer with the suicide attempt of the youngest sister, Cecilia, as she slits her wrist in a bath. After her parents allow her to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make her feel better, Cecilia excuses herself and jumps out of her second story bedroom window, dying when she is impaled on an iron fence below. In the wake of her act, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from the community and heightens air of mystery about the girls to the neighborhood boys in particular. At the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the school heartthrob. Trip comes over one night to the Lisbon residence in hopes of getting closer to Lux and watches television with the family.

Guilty: Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, pictured today, who got into the Olympic Stadium without a ticket then threw a beer bottle at competitors lining up for the men's 100m final has been found guilty of public disorder. A man who got into the Olympic Stadium without a ticket then threw a beer bottle at competitors lining up for the men's 100m final has been found guilty of public disorder. Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, hurled abuse at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt then threw a plastic beer bottle on to the track before the race on August 5. Gill-Webb, from South Milford, near Leeds, was today found guilty at Stratford Magistrates' Court, east London, of public disorder. Gill-Webb, who suffers from bipolar affective disorder, pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area at the stadium and started shouting: 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an a***hole,' Stratford Magistrates' Court heard last week. He then threw the plastic beer bottle as the race - which Bolt won in 9.63 seconds - started on August 5 last year. The 34-year-old was confronted by Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch, then escorted from the stadium and arrested. The court heard that he used an old ticket to get into the Olympic Park, and then the stadium. Police never found a ticket on him. Gill-Webb was suffering from a manic episode at the time, with an urge to be 'involved' in the Olympics, the court heard. His lawyers argued that his mental state meant he could not have intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress, but the Crown said that, although he was unwell, he knew what he was doing. The court heard that Gill-Webb pushed his way to the front of the exclusive seating area after getting into the stadium. Prosecutor Neil King described him. mingling with members of the Dutch Olympic team, but his 'shouting and. jostling', then throwing the bottle, led to a confrontation with. Ms Bosch. In a statement, she described how he pushed past her to get to the front of the seating. Scroll down to watch. Foolish: The bottle can be seen landing on the track yards from Usain Bolt, far left, after being thrown by Gill-Webb, circled top. Disorder: Gill-Webb threw the bottle, which can be seen bottom centre of this image, onto the track at the start of the Men's 100m Final. 'He was shouting specifically at Usain Bolt. Things like 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an arsehole',' she said. 'He repeated these taunts over and over - it went on and on for about two minutes.' She saw Gill-Webb move his arm behind his head, then forwards in a throwing motion, then saw the bottle hit the track, she said. Ms Bosch confronted him, saying 'Dude, are you crazy?' 'He was trying to walk away so I pushed him hard to stop him,' she said. 'I was angry with what he had done, which was so disrespectful.' Restrained: Gill-Webb is pictured being detained by security after he threw a bottle onto the track just before the men's 100-metre final at the London 2012 Olympic Games. Abusive: Gill-Webb, who suffers from bipolar affective disorder, pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area at the stadium and started shouting at Usain Bolt. Other witnesses saw Gill-Webb shouting at finalists including Bolt, fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake, and US sprinter Justin Gatlin. Student Farzin Mirshahi heard him yell: 'Believe in Blake, no Usain' while her brother, Kiya Mirshahi, heard: 'Usain, no, Justin, you are a druggie, believe in Blake, no Usain, no.' After the incident, Gill-Webb - who the court heard has since lost his job - was escorted from the stadium and then arrested. His behaviour in police custody was said to be 'somewhat unusual', and he told officers that he was Scottish actor Alan Cumming, signing a statement with the star's name. Gill-Webb, who did not give evidence during his trial, originally denied throwing the bottle, but his DNA was later found on it. He later said he could not remember the incident. Guilty: Ashley Gill-Webb, left, is pictured leaving the court earlier in his trial. Champion: Despite the bottle and the abuse he suffered, Jamaica's Usain Bolt still went on to win the 100m final. Summing up his case, prosecutor Neil King said video footage showed Gill-Webb looking left and right, 'shuffling' behind other people, then surreptitiously throwing the bottle, suggesting he knew what he was doing was wrong, and clearly had intent. But Rhiannon Crimmins, defending, said Gill-Webb was mentally ill at the time and the video just showed a man behaving 'oddly'. Finding Gill-Webb guilty of both charges, District Judge William Ashworth said today: 'The video, in my view, clearly shows Mr Gill-Webb checking to see if he is under observation before taking the risk of throwing the bottle. 'I am sure that he was at that point weighing up the chances of being caught.' He said Gill-Webb's actions were 'rational and wrong' and intended to cause harassment, alarm and distress.

The Lions at that time had never beaten the Redskins in Washington, D.C. Though the first quarter was scoreless, the Redskins began what would be a 14-play 80-yard drive in the second quarter that finished with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Jason Campbell to Chris Cooley. The Redskins' next possession began at their own 17-yard line: in summary, an 83-yard drive in 7 plays, culminating in a touchdown for Mike Sellers in a 1-yard rushing play. The first half ended with the Redskins up, 14-0. With 2:27 left in the third quarter, the Lions scored their first and only points with a 39-yard field goal to bring the score to 14-3. The Redskins' next drive was only 9 yards and resulted in a punt, but put the Lions on their own 8-yard line. After a rushing play that resulted in a loss of 1 yard, the Redskins sacked Lions' quarterback Jon Kitna in the end zone for a safety, increasing the Redskins' lead to 13 with a score of 16-3 to end the third quarter. After a fourth-quarter fumble by Redskins' running back Clinton Portis, the Lions took possession at their own 10-yard line. The Lions drove 26 yards before punting to James Thrash, who returned the punt for 62 yards and fumbled towards the end zone, where Rock Cartwright recovered the ball on the 3-yard line. After a Redskins' five-yard penalty, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Mike Sellers and then converted a two-point attempt with a pass to Chris Cooley bringing the score to 24-3.

Q:Information: - Reinhard Haupenthal ( born February 17 , 1945 ) is a German Esperantist , Volapükist ( or Volapükologist ) , translator , and linguist . Donald J. Harlow described Haupenthal 's personal style in a warning to potential readers of Haupenthal 's translation of Goethe 's Young Werther : \`\` the vocabulary used by Haupenthal is far from standard , and at times the Esperanto verges on the incomprehensible . '' - An Esperantist is a person who speaks or uses Esperanto. If its meaning corresponded with its full etymology, an Esperantist would be someone who supports or specializes in those who hope (from Esperanto \\"esperanto\\" \\"a hoping one\\", \\"someone who hopes\\", from \\"esperi\\" \\"to hope\\"). Although definitions of \\"Esperantist\\" vary, according to the Declaration of Boulogne (\\"Deklaracio pri la esenco de Esperantismo\\", declaration about the essence of esperantism), a document agreed at the first World Congress of Esperanto, an Esperantist is someone who speaks Esperanto and uses it for any purpose. An Esperantist is also a person who participates in Esperanto culture. - The Declaration of Boulogne (full name: \\"Deklaracio pri la esenco de Esperantismo\\", declaration about the essence of Esperantism) was a document written by L. L. Zamenhof and endorsed by the attendees of the first World Congress of Esperanto in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France in 1905. It defined \\"Esperantism\\" as a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to natural languages in international and inter-ethnic contexts, not as a substitute for them within their proper realm. It declared that the Esperanto movement as such is politically and religiously neutral. It noted that Esperanto is in the public domain and anyone can use it however they like, as the creator of the language resigned his rights to it at the beginning. It said that the only obligatory authority for Esperanto speakers is the \\"Fundamento de Esperanto\\" (a collection of the early grammar, dictionary and sample text documents), which all speakers of the language are recommended to imitate for the sake of stability in the language. - A volapükologist is a person whose scientific interest is Volapük or who learns the language for hobby reasons. - Volapük (in English; in Volapük) is a constructed language, created in 18791880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany. Schleyer felt that God had told him in a dream to create an international language. Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. In 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents.

Please write a short summary for the following article: How the Yankees gambled big on most glaring weakness The Yankees offseason checklist looked something like this: 1. Find a shortstop – priority one. 5. Avoid further risky, long-term investment. 6. Protect the best of the farm system and add to it when possible. 7. Create roster depth and flexibility. 8. Put safety nets in place for the rotation. The Yankees accomplished seven of the eight objectives – everything but creating a better security blanket for their fragile rotation. Yet, even while checking off so many items on their list, the success of the Yankees’ offseason is, at best, to be determined. This is partly because there might have been no more vital requirement for 2015 success than finding better depth for a rotation in which Masahiro Tanaka, CC Sabathia and Michael Pineda would more fittingly wear red flags than pinstripes. And also because there is so much mystery about what they can expect from nearly every corner of their roster. Here are five thoughts on the Yankees offseason to date: Didi Gregorius at his offseason home in CuracaoPhoto: Berber van Beek / Barcroft USA 1. The Steinbrenner Yankees playbook essentially had been to acquire famous names who have played their five best seasons and hope they don’t fade. In Didi Gregorius and Nathan Eovaldi, the Yankees are trying the opposite approach. Both turn 25 later this month. The Yankees’ hope is they have served their major league apprenticeships, gotten most of the growing pains out of the way and are about to enjoy their five best seasons. That Gregorius can find enough offense to make keeping his glove in the daily lineup easier. That Eovaldi has learned that throwing harder in every crisis is a faulty strategy. The way these two players go ultimately will determine where on the A-to-F grading system this Yankees offseason falls. 2. Aaron Judge and Ian Clarkin are why the Yankees no longer have David Robertson. The Yankees front office adored Robertson, but on a scouting level had him on somewhat equal footing with Andrew Miller. All things being equal, the Yankees probably would have stuck with the player they knew best (Robertson). David Robertson joins the White Sox bullpen.Photo: AP But in the organization’s mind, all things were not equal. Robertson rejected the team’s qualifying offer, which meant the Yankees would get a compensation pick between the first and second round of the draft when he signed elsewhere. Two drafts ago, after Rafael Soriano and Nick Swisher signed elsewhere, they used picks 32-33 overall to take Judge and Clarkin, who are now two of their best prospects — and in the case of Judge, one of the game’s better prospects. Miller plus that pick was more attractive to the Yankees than Robertson. 3. Last July, the Red Sox released Chris Capuano and essentially gave Stephen Drew away in a trade to the Yankees. Capuano was fine as a Yankee, Drew was not, yet the Yankees gave both 5 million to try again. You wonder if either makes it through July 2015 as a Yankee. Both are miscast. Capuano is best utilized as a swingman, but is one of the Yankees’ five starters. Drew is a shortstop playing second. Maybe Capuano is simply a bridge to when (if?) Luis Severino is ready for promotion or when (if?) Ivan Nova is back after Tommy John surgery. But with so much uncertainty in the rotation, Capuano is not the only one who might need to be rescued. Drew went from a .777 OPS championship shortstop in 2013 to a .536 OPS abomination last year. Was 2014 about his disjointed season or has he fallen and can’t get up? 4. Besides Capuano and Drew, the Yankees re-enlisted Chase Headley and Chris Young after both played far better for them than they did with the Padres and Mets, respectively. Were those small-sample size aberrations or signs the Yankees have a quality starting third baseman and a valuable fourth outfielder? The latter is particularly important given Carlos Beltran’s iffy health. 5. The Yankees’ offseason has left them good enough to finish first in the AL East or bad enough to finish fifth. You know who else we can say that about? Every other team in the division. The Red Sox (Hanley Ramirez/Pablo Sandoval) and Blue Jays (Josh Donaldson/Russ Martin) both upgraded their lineups but remain without true aces (maybe without even legitimate No. 2 starters). The Orioles get Manny Machado and Matt Wieters back from injury, but they lost Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis and had the discomfort of their general manager, Dan Duquette, looking for an exit strategy to become Toronto’s team president. The Rays retained the strongest rotation in the division, but dealt Ben Zobrist and Wil Myers to gamble on Asdrubal Cabrera still being able to play shortstop and Steven Souza being ready to hit in the majors. So what kind of offseason did the Yankees have? Everything is by comparison, so the answer could be: How did the rest of the division do this winter? Summary:","completion":"The New York Yankees had a busy offseason, focusing on improving their roster and addressing weaknesses. However, despite accomplishing seven of the eight objectives they set out for themselves, the success of the Yankees' offseason still remains to be determined, largely due to the uncertainty in their rotation. The performance of newcomers Didi Gregorius and Nathan Eovaldi, as well as decisions made regarding player investments, will play a key role in the Yankees' direction going forward. The team's uncertain roster situation leaves them in a position where they could potentially finish first or last in the AL East, with other teams in the division facing similar uncertainty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. Question: \\"The main country that influenced Japan in the region\\" Answer: \\"Chinese\\" Is this answer correct? OPT: 1). no. 2). yes....I think the answer is","completion":"2). yes. The answer is indeed correct. China has been the main country that influenced Japan in the region, especially during the sixth to eighth centuries. Chinese culture, including Buddhism, was introduced to Japanese society through numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists who traveled to China to study various aspects of its civilization. Through figures like Prince Shotoku and the establishment of relations with the Sui dynasty, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, bureaucracy, and even adopted the Chinese calendar for calculating Japan's foundation. Additionally, as mentioned in the description, the Chinese influences permeated into Japanese religion, history, music, literature, and painting, allowing for further development and adaptation within Japan. Thus, it is clear that China played a significant role in shaping the early history and culture of Japan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: I referenced this in my answer to Why do guys pretend they don't understand when the girl they like gives them all hints of liking them too? While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing. We dated another month or two while we were both there. I was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening. Question: Why did the girl want to kiss?

The path to the semi-finals saw England finishing second in Group G, after winning two of their three group-stage matches: 1. England 2-1 Tunisia on June 18, 2018 2. England 6-1 Panama on June 24, 2018 3. England 0-1 Belgium on June 28, 2018 In the Round of 16, England played against Colombia on July 3, 2018. The match ended in a 1-1 draw after extra time, but England emerged victorious (4-3) in a penalty shootout, breaking their long-standing curse of losing in penalty shootouts in major tournaments. In the quarter-finals, England faced Sweden on July 7, 2018, and secured a comfortable 2-0 victory, advancing to the semi-finals. The semi-final match took place on July 11, 2018, in Moscow, where England faced Croatia. England initially took the lead with an early goal scored by Kieran Trippier. However, Croatia managed to equalize in the second half with a goal from Ivan Perišić and ultimately won 2-1 after a goal was scored by Mario Mandžukić during extra time. This result brought England's journey to an end, and they subsequently lost the third-place play-off game against Belgium (2-0) on July 14, 2018, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.

Samuel struggled, trying to keep up with Brett's seemingly natural ability to disconnect and move on. For as long as they had been friends, Samuel was known to easily form and cultivate strong emotional ties with people. This characteristic of Samuel's seemed to be the opposing force to Brett's self-sufficient nature. As Samuel tried to understand and cope with the distance that Brett could easily place between them, he began to question what made Brett so different. Was it something inherent in his personality, or had he simply learned to adapt that way over time? Deep down, Samuel knew he had to accept and appreciate his own strengths and weaknesses, even if it meant coming to terms with the differences between him and his best friend. One day, he decided to have an honest conversation with Brett about it. \\"Hey, Brett,\\" Samuel called as they walked together in the park. \\"Yeah?\\" Brett replied, glancing over at him. \\"I've been thinking... how do you manage to be so independent? I mean, you have no problem detaching yourself from family and friends when needed.\\" Brett thought for a moment before responding. He had never really considered why he was this way, but discussing it with Samuel might help both of them understand it better. Step 1: Reflecting on upbringing and past experiences \\"I guess it has to do with how I was raised. My parents always encouraged me to be self-reliant and do things on my own. Plus, we moved around a lot when I was a child, so I never really got too attached to one place or group of friends.\\" Step 2: Analyzing personal traits \\"As for my personality, I think I've always been more introverted and independent. I enjoy spending time alone and don't feel the need to constantly be surrounded by others. That's not to say I don't value my relationships, though.\\" Step 3: Providing advice based on shared experiences \\"Samuel, it's important to recognize that we all have different strengths and ways of dealing with things. While I may be more independent in some respects, you have a gift for connecting with others and building strong bonds. That's something I envy about you.\\" Step 4: Reassuring the importance of the friendship \\"Don't worry about trying to change who you are. We all need to embrace our own characteristics and make the most out of what makes us unique. And, even though I might be more detached at times, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate or value our friendship.

Context: In 1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of \\"State Sponsors of Terrorism\\", while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.

No; Based on the given product review, it appears that the reviewer has mixed opinions about the \\"Napkin Folding\\" book. While they find some aspects of it positive, such as visually appealing folds, they are also struggling with the incomprehensible instructions that come with those folds. The title of the review, \\"Some good-looking folds, but incomprehensible instructions,\\" already gives an indication that there are both positive and negative elements to the reviewer's experience with the product. This observation is reinforced by the content of the review, which highlights the fact that the author, Ginders, is fine when writing conventional text but seems to have made his explanations too brief, leading to confusion and difficulty in understanding the instructions. The reviewer also mentions that the appealing folds are a small percentage of those included in the book, suggesting that the product may not have entirely met their expectations or provided enough value for their interest in napkin folding. On the one hand, the positive aspect of the review is the good-looking folds, which the reviewer finds compelling and can be considered an attractive feature of the product. The appreciation for the visual aspect of the folds could appeal to potential buyers who prioritize aesthetics in their napkin folding projects. On the other hand, the main issue mentioned by the reviewer is the incomprehensible instructions, which significantly hinder their ability to enjoy and make use of the product. This could be a major concern for potential buyers, as it indicates that even those with experience in napkin folding, like the reviewer, might struggle to make practical use of the book. Taking both the positive and negative aspects of this review into account, the answer to the question, \\"Is this product review positive?\\" would be option I. No. The reason for this choice is that the review's negative elements, namely the lack of clarity and usefulness of the instructions, outweigh the positive aspect which is the visually appealing folds.

The town's dead, led by Melissa's great-great-great-great-grandmother Lucinda Cavender, a witch who was put to death 300 years earlier, rise up from their graves and roam the town. As Melissa, Vinnie, Mitch, and Mary enjoy themselves at their annual Halloween costume party, Phil encounters a mysterious girl, named Sandra \\"Sandy\\" Matthews, dressed in a vintage 1950's cheerleader outfit, who warns him that the whole town is in danger. Meanwhile, Lucinda and the various undead crash the costume party. At first, nobody pays much attention to them since everyone is in costume. However, Lucinda begins turning the party guests into vampires, starting with her great-great-great-great-granddaughter Melissa. When Sandy discovers that Phil and his friends recited the ancient spell in the cemetery, they realize that the whole town is being overrun by the living dead and decide to team up to break the curse. The only way to do so is to find the Grenville Spirit Ring inside the grave of a witch-hunter Nathaniel Grenville - who, coincidentally, was Phil's great-great-great-great-grandfather and slave owner of Lucinda Cavender, her arch-nemesis - and use it to undo the curse. Phil and \\"good ghost\\" Sandy must restore the town to normal by midnight before it is too late and the curse becomes permanent.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences essentially convey the same meaning while using slightly different wordings and structures. To provide a detailed comparison and analysis, let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. Both sentences refer to a specific type of bias, described as \\"cultural liberal bias\\" in the first sentence and \\"culturally liberal bias\\" in the second sentence. The use of \\"cultural\\" versus \\"culturally\\" is a minor grammatical difference, but the meaning remains the same. In both cases, the sentences discuss a bias that leans towards cultural liberalism. 2. Both sentences mention the same individual, former BBC director Roger Mosey. The first sentence uses \\"former BBC director\\" as a title preceding his name, while the second sentence places a hyphen between \\"former\\" and \\"BBC\\" and uses \\"director\\" as a separate part of his title. Despite these slight formatting differences, the intended meaning is the same - to identify the person who made the classification. 3. Both sentences refer to an alternative classification of the bias as \\"liberal defensive.\\" The first sentence uses single quotes (\`\` '') to set this phrase apart, while the second sentence employs double quotes (\`\` \\"\\"). The use of single or double quotes in this context is a stylistic choice and does not alter the meaning being conveyed. In conclusion, the two sentences are paraphrases because they convey the same idea - that the bias in question can be characterized as both a cultural (or culturally) liberal bias and a liberal defensive bias, as stated by former BBC director Roger Mosey. The primary differences between the sentences are stylistic and do not impact the overall meaning being communicated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which trader would most likely be engaged in black market trading, trader A or trader B? In the beginning of this century there was scandal in the financial market regarding black market trading. A trader named Trader A was working for Bank A. He noticed country M has pegged its currency to a fixed price while country N did not do that. He opted to trade country M currency. Across the aisle his colleague trader B was working for bank B. He traded country N's currency. Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","completion":"Trader A would most likely be engaged in black market trading. This is because Trader A is trading country M's currency, which has a fixed exchange rate set by the government. The hint provided suggests that foreign exchange controls, such as a fixed exchange rate, can lead to the creation of black markets for exchanging the weaker currency for stronger currencies. In this scenario, the exchange rate for the foreign currency might be much higher in the black market than the rate set by the government, making it more appealing for traders like Trader A to participate in black market trading. Meanwhile, Trader B is trading country N's currency, a currency that does not have a fixed exchange rate, which makes it less likely for black market trading to occur in that context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth. - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages. - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines. - A simple suspension bridge (also rope bridge, swing bridge (in New Zealand), suspended bridge, hanging bridge and catenary bridge) is a primitive type of bridge that is supported entirely from anchors at either end and has no towers or piers. However, it may have saddles. In such bridges, the deck of the bridge follows the downward and upward arc of the load-bearing cables, with additional light ropes at a higher level used to form a handrail. Alternatively, stout handrail cables supported on short piers at each end may be the primary load-bearing element, with the deck suspended below. Suspended well from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward catenary arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads. Owing to practical limitation in the grade (i.e. the deck being an arc, not flat) and the response to dynamic loads of the bridge deck, this type is quite restricted in its load-carrying capacity relative to its span. This type of bridge is considered the most efficient and sustainable design in developing countries, however, especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete. - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms and how they integrate with natural or man-made features. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world. - Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning. For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least: - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - A footbridge (also called a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed for pedestrians and in some cases cyclists, animal traffic, and horse riders, instead of vehicular traffic. Footbridges complement the landscape and can be used decoratively to visually link two distinct areas or to signal a transaction. In many developed countries, footbridges are both functional and can be beautiful works of art and sculpture. For poor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets, which would otherwise be unreachable when rivers are too high to cross. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructible in such rural areas using only local materials and labor. - A polymer (Greek \\"poly-\\", \\"many\\" + \\"-mer\\", \\"parts\\") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Kingsgate Bridge is a striking , modern reinforced concrete construction footbridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building .

Hypothesis: A man wearing a hat and a red shirt is looking at someone else. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise. The premise provides a detailed description of the situation: \\"A man with a red shirt and black hat stares at another man.\\" This statement presents a clear picture of a man who is dressed in a particular attire, specifically, a red shirt and a black hat. Furthermore, the premise states that this man is staring at another man. Moving to the hypothesis, it states: \\"A man wearing a hat and a red shirt is looking at someone else.\\" This hypothesis seems to be a more generalized version of the premise. Here, too, we have a man donning a hat and a red shirt. While the hat's color is not explicitly mentioned, it doesn't contradict the premise – the possibility of this man wearing a black hat is still valid. Additionally, the hypothesis asserts that the man is fixated on (or looking at) someone else. When comparing both the premise and the hypothesis, they share similarities in terms of the man's clothing and his action of staring or looking at another person. The presence of a red shirt, a hat (potentially black), and the man's engagement with another individual aligns with the asserted hypothesis. Taking the provided information into account, it can be concluded that the hypothesis generally aligns with the given premise. The man's clothing, the color of his hat, and the fact that he is observing another man are consistent between the premise and the hypothesis. While there are slight differences in their wordings, such as \\"looking at\\" versus \\"stares at,\\" and the slightly less detailed hat description in the hypothesis, these differences are not significant enough to negate the hypothesis.

Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle.

A prime integer is defined as an integer that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The task is to remove any integer that is not prime from a given list of integers and return the list of prime numbers. To accomplish this task, I would follow these steps: 1. Create an empty list called 'prime_list' to store the prime integers found in the input list. 2. Loop through each integer in the given input list. 3. For each integer, check if it's a prime number. To do this, I can implement a function that takes the integer as input and returns True if it's prime and False otherwise. 4. Inside the prime checking function, since 1 is not considered a prime number, return False if the input is 1. If the input is 2, return True since 2 is the smallest prime number. For other integers greater than 2, check for divisibility by the integers in the range of 2 to the square root of the number + 1. If any of them is a factor, return False, otherwise, return True. 5. If the prime checking function returns True, append the integer to the 'prime_list'. 6. Continue the loop until all integers in the input list have been checked. 7. Return 'prime_list' as the output. If no prime numbers were found, the output will be an empty list. For the given input [877, 463, 540], applying the mentioned steps, I find that 877 and 463 are prime integers, while 540 is not prime as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

He could potentially become a famous treasure hunter or explorer, using his newfound wealth to live a life of luxury, with a grand house and numerous servants and companions as described in his thoughts. 2. Manifestation of Evil Thoughts: Although Malone tells himself not to think evil thoughts, the allure of material wealth may lead him down a darker path. It is possible that he could become involved in illicit activities such as smuggling, piracy, or criminal operations in order to obtain the riches he dreams of. This may result in him living a life of opulence but also constantly being in danger and potentially falling afoul of the law. 3. Disappointed Dreamer: Alternatively, Malone might not find the anticipated treasure or be able to attain the wealth he desires. He could end up disillusioned by the harsh realities of life and struggle to make ends meet.

He could choose to reassess his priorities and focus on building a life filled with love, friendship, and personal growth. Malone might find contentment in a modest lifestyle, appreciating the simple pleasures and relationships that enrich one's life.

However, this year was slightly different, as Tanya's family decided to invite Katrina's family to their home to celebrate Hanukkah together. This made Katrina not only excited but also a little nervous as she did not know much about Hanukkah traditions. Before going into the story, let's establish the background for our two main characters: [+] Katrina practices Judaism; [+] Tanya practices Judaism. Since both Katrina and Tanya practice Judaism, it was not odd for them to share their cultural practices. This year's joint celebration would be a heartwarming experience where both families could learn more about each other's customs, embrace the similarities, and respect the differences. As the day approached, Katrina and her family decided to do some research to learn about Hanukkah, its rituals, and the traditional food served during the eight-day celebration. They wanted to be prepared and respectful when participating in the festivities with Tanya's family. On the first night of Hanukkah, Katrina's family arrived at Tanya's house, bringing some traditional Christmas treats as a gesture of goodwill. Tanya's family warmly welcomed them, and the two families began their evening by lighting the menorah together. Step 1: Lighting the Menorah The families gathered to light the menorah. Tanya's father handed Katrina's father the shamash, the special candle used to light the other candles on the menorah. This was an opportunity for both families to bond while participating in an important Hanukkah ritual. Step 2: Reciting prayers While lighting the menorah, Tanya's mother led the families in reciting the Hanukkah blessings. Katrina's family listened carefully and tried their best to follow along, showing their respect for Tanya's family's traditions. Step 3: Sharing the Meal After lighting the menorah and reciting the prayers, it was time for dinner. Tanya's family had prepared various traditional Hanukkah dishes, such as latkes and sufganiyot. They explained the significance of these dishes to Katrina's family, and everyone sat down to enjoy the delicious food. Step 4: Playing Dreidel As the meal came to an end, Tanya suggested playing the dreidel game, a traditional Hanukkah activity. Tanya's family taught Katrina's family the rules, and everyone got involved in the game, laughing and having a great time. Step 5: Gift Exchange As a way to combine the two celebrations and show appreciation for each other's traditions, the families decided to have a small gift exchange. Katrina's family gifted Tanya's family a lovely set of Christmas ornaments, while Tanya's family gave Katrina's family a beautiful menorah. This year's combined celebration of Hanukkah and Christmas was a unique and meaningful experience for both families. By embracing each other's traditions, they not only deepened their friendship but also enriched their understanding of each other's beliefs. As they vowed to continue such gatherings in the future, the bond between Katrina and Tanya grew stronger, and the love and respect between their families blossomed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen). That night, D'Artagnan is pleasantly surprised when Bernajou's ward Constance (Heather Angel) enters the room. It turns out that it is actually her chamber, though she is rarely there, as she spends most of her time at the palace as lady-in-waiting to the Queen. Constance has arranged a rendezvous between Queen Anne (Rosamond Pinchot) and her lover, the English Duke of Buckingham (Ralph Forbes). Buckingham threatens to wage war to obtain Anne, but she dissuades him by appealing to his love; she gives him her diamonds as a pledge for peace.

After a very stressful day I went to the barber for a relaxing shave. I love the hot towels, the pre-shave oil and the hot lather. The short, definite, confident strokes of a barbers straight blade moving across my face is great. I find it all very relaxing. But, I found nothing relaxing about this barber shop. When I walked in, the music was very loud latin music. It reminded me of music you hear at a night club. The towels felt more warm than hot. When I mentioned the towels weren't hot, she argued they were hot!! I'm not sure, but I think the towel might have been hot. I think she pulled it out of the hot box and ran it under hot water. The hot water isn't nearly as hot as the towel when it comes out of the hot box, so it actually would cool the towel. Not positive if that is what happened, but the towel should have been much hotter and the barber should not have argued with me. The barber was a very young woman. She took no care in applying the pre-shave oil. She did not slap it on, but I doubt I would have noticed too much of a difference if she had slapped it on. There was a quickness that felt rushed. Now the worst part....the blade across my face HURT!!!!! It hurt a LOT!!!! I made her stop. I just couldn't take it. I left with only a 1/4 of my face shaved.

Answer the following question: This article: Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?, what is it ?

That’s according to a new report from Microsoft Canada, which included an online survey of more than 2,000 Canadians, as well as an observation of more than 100 study participants doing tasks while their brainwaves were measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The larger survey group was also asked to perform game-like tasks that measure different types of attention, such as looking for patterns in a series, or spotting differences in a set of images. The research found that more digitally savvy consumers have high bursts of intense attention at the beginning of a task, but that attention falls over time. By contrast, less frequent digital users tend to have lower bursts of attention out of the gate, but increased attention over a sustained period of time. However, researchers caution that this does not necessarily mean that digitally connected people don’t register information mentally: When observed while connected to EEG, that group showed high instances of brain signals associated with encoding information to memory, even though they have lower attention spans over all. And shortened attention spans are not just a phenomenon among younger people; people who are highly digitally engaged, no matter the age, showed similar results. The point of the research, in part, is to help advertisers understand how to craft marketing communications in a changing media environment. It’s important that ads adjust for digital Canadians’ front-loaded attention spans, which drop off quickly, said Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead at Microsoft Canada. “We need to be more clear and concise with messaging as early as possible – almost crafting headlines,” Ms. Gausby said, suggesting that marketers take their cues from billboards, which have always had to compete to be noticed in environments with plenty of stimuli. The research also looked at how people behave in multiscreen environments, such as the common habit of picking up a smartphone during a lag in entertainment. It showed that people are becoming effective at multitasking, and paying attention to more than one thing at a time. “They were on their phones, and … they were reacting to what was happening on the TV even when they weren’t watching it,” Ms. Gausby said. “They were still laughing at the jokes, or when there were auditory cues, such as a tense moment, they would all look up. … It’s great news for marketers that multiscreening doesn’t reduce the potential impact of marketing.” Canadians’ digital behaviours When nothing is occupying my attention, the first thing I do is reach for my phone 65+: 10% agree 18 to 24 y.o.: 77% agree I check my phone at least every 30 minutes 65+: 6% 18-24: 52% The last thing I do before I go to bed is check my phone 65+: 18% 18-24: 73% I often use other devices while watching TV 65+: 42% 18-24: 79% I watch more TV programs through catch-up/streamed TV than live 65+: 13% 18-24: 74% I often watch a number of episodes of a show back-to-back 65+: 43% 18-24: 87% How changing attention spans affect people at work/school Really have to concentrate hard to stay focused on tasks at work/school All: 44% Highest among: Early tech adopters: 68% Heavy social-media users: 67% 18- to 24-year-olds: 67% Heavy multiscreeners: 57% High-volume media consumers: 55% Get sidetracked from what they’re doing at work/school by unrelated thoughts or daydreams All: 45% Highest among: Early tech adopters: 66% Heavy social-media users: 65% 18- to 24-year-olds: 61% Heavy multiscreeners: 60% High-volume media consumers: 55% Don’t make the best use of their time so sometimes they have to work late/weekends All: 37% Highest among: 18- to 24-year-olds: 71% Early tech adopters: 62% Heavy social-media users: 62% Heavy multiscreeners: 51% High-volume media consumers: 48% Source: Microsoft attention spans online survey, Spring 2015, 2,000 Canadian respondents Report Typo/Error ||||| People now have shorter attention spans than goldfish — and our always-on portable devices may be to blame, a new study suggests. The study from Microsoft Corp. draws on surveys of more than 2,000 Canadians who played games online in order to determine the impact that pocket-sized devices and the increased availability of digital media and information are having on everyday life. Researchers also did in-lab monitoring, using electroencephalograms (EEGs) to monitor brain activity of 112 people. Among the findings of the 54-page study was that, thanks to our desire to always be connected, people can multi-task like never before. However, our attention spans have fallen from an average of 12 seconds in the year 2000 to just eight seconds today. A goldfish is believed to have a nine-second attention span on average, the study says. “Canadians with more digital lifestyles (those who consume more media, are multi-screeners, social media enthusiasts, or earlier adopters of technology) struggle to focus in environments where prolonged attention is needed,” reads the study. “While digital lifestyles decrease sustained attention overall, it’s only true in the long-term. Early adopters and heavy social media users front load their attention and have more intermittent bursts of high attention. They’re better at identifying what they want/don’t want to engage with and need less to process and commit things to memory.” Microsoft’s data is supported by similar findings released by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information and the National Library of Medicine in the U.S. Among the most concerning findings of the study is our declining ability to sustain our focus during repetitive activities: Forty-four per cent of respondents said they had to concentrate really hard to stay focused on tasks, while 37 per cent said they were unable to make the best use of their time, forcing them to work late evenings and or weekends. The study further found evidence to suggest that people are increasingly displaying “addiction-like behaviours” when it comes to their devices: • 77 per cent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 24 reported they reach for their phone or mobile device when they feel bored; • 52 per cent check their phone every 30 minutes or less; and • 79 per cent reported using their portable devices while watching television. Bruce Morton, a researcher with the University of Western Ontario’s Brain & Mind Institute, said it’s actually a natural reaction that the human brain is having. The brain is remarkable when it comes to collecting information and processing it, Morton said. The more you feed it, the hungrier it gets. Technology is now feeding it an ever-expanding diet. “When we first invented the car, it was so novel. The thought of having an entertainment device in the car was ridiculous because the car itself was the entertainment,” he said. “After a while, travelling for eight hours at a time, you’d had enough of it. The brain is bored. You put radios in the car and video displays. Why? Because after the first 10 minutes of the drive I’ve had enough already. I understand this.” “Just because we may be allocating our attention differently as a function of the technologies we may be using, it doesn’t mean that the way our attention actually can function has changed,” he said. “Digital technologies dovetail seamlessly into the information processing abilities of our brain.” Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead with Microsoft Canada, said the company conducted the research on behalf of marketing firms to help them better understand how people are using today’s mobile technologies. “We know that consumers’ lives are increasingly digital whether at home or at work, or anywhere in-between. We see now that news is reduced to 140 characters, some conversations are condensed to emojis and we wanted to understand how this affecting the way that Canadians see and interact with the world,” said Gausby. “It’s our new ‘newsfeed reality,’ as I like to put it.” Microsoft’s study is considered accurate to within plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. ||||| The Kimpton hotel chain across Canada and the US will put a goldfish in any guests hotel room for the duration of their stay if they are feeling a bit lonely. It is called the 'Guppy Love' program and hotel staff will make sure it is fed and cared for. Ever wonder if that device that never leaves your hand is taking a toll on your attention span? A 54-page Microsoft study that looked at surveys of more than 2,000 Canadians — and monitored 112 people’s brain activity — says it is. In fact, we now have shorter attention spans than goldfish, a fact researchers believe can be linked to our inability to put down our smartphones and other portable devices. A study in 2000 revealed that Canadians had 12-second attention spans, on average. That number has now dropped to 8 seconds, an entire second shorter than that of goldfish. “Canadians with more digital lifestyles (those who consume more media, are multi-screeners, social media enthusiasts, or earlier adopters of technology) struggle to focus in environments where prolonged attention is needed,” reads the study. The study found a number of concerning statistics and “addiction-like behaviours” from the always-connected respondents: 44 per cent of respondents claimed they had to concentrate really hard to stay focused on tasks, 37 per cent said they were unable to make the best use of their time (often leading to working late in the evenings and on weekends), 77 per cent of respondents admitted to reaching for their phones when they feel bored, and 79 per cent reported using portable devices even when watching TV. The study was intended to help marketers reach their multitasking audience. Apparently using your smartphone while you watch TV is a good thing for advertisers. “They were on their phones, and…they were reacting to what was happening on the TV even when they weren’t watching it,” Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead with Microsoft Canada, told the Globe and Mail of observing participants in a multiscreen environment. “They were still laughing at the jokes, or when there were auditory cues, such as a tense moment, they would all look up.” “It’s great news for marketers that multiscreening doesn’t reduce the potential impact of marketing.” Gausby said Microsoft conducted the research to better understand how people are using today’s technologies. “We see now that news is reduced to 140 characters, some conversations are condensed to emojis and we wanted to understand how this affecting the way that Canadians see and interact with the world,” she said. “It’s our new ‘newsfeed reality,’ as I like to put it.” Bruce Morton, a researcher with the University of Western Ontario’s Brain & Mind Institute, told the Ottawa Citizen that the more we feed the brain, the hungrier it gets. “When we first invented the car, it was so novel.

Morton added, “digital technologies dovetail seamlessly into the information processing abilities of our brain.” Last year, advertising researchers tracked 200 British people’s gadget habits and found that the average person switched devices a whopping 21 times an hour. How often do you put down your devices? Have you noticed your attention span shortening since you started carrying a smartphone with you everywhere? ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A new study by Microsoft Canada reveals that the increasing usage of digital devices is changing our attention spans, finding that more digitally inclined individuals, regardless of age, tend to have high bursts of intense focus at the beginning of a task, but their attention quickly diminishes over time.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is: The Caribbean island where a test match was abandoned in 2009 after only 10 balls were bowled is Antigua. The event took place during the second Test match between England and West Indies at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua. This match was scheduled from February 13th to 17th, 2009 as a part of the 2009 Test series between the two teams. On the very first morning of the match, February 13th, 2009, England's captain Andrew Strauss won the toss and chose to bat first. However, the match got off to an unusual start as West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards slipped several times while delivering the first over. After only 10 balls were bowled, it became evident that the sandy and soft outfield conditions were dangerous for the players. Umpires Tony Hill and Rudi Koertzen, along with match referee Alan Hurst, decided to abandon the game because of the unsuitable playing conditions. This became the second shortest Test match in history, with the shortest being the 1995 Test match between West Indies and England in the Guyana National Stadium, which was abandoned after only 2 balls due to a wet and dangerous pitch. The abandonment of the 2009 Antigua Test was a significant moment in cricket history as it raised concerns about the standard of pitch preparation and highlighted the importance of player safety. The rest of the series was played without any further interruptions, and the replacement third Test match was held at the Antigua Recreation Ground from February 15th to 19th, 2009. The series concluded with West Indies winning 1-0, after winning the first Test in Jamaica and drawing the remaining matches in Antigua, Barbados, and Trinidad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

OPT: (A). intoxicated (B). foolish (C). very cavalier with their partying Answer:","completion":"Quinn's behavior, as described, can be characterized in various ways, encompassing aspects of all the given options. To provide a comprehensive understanding of Quinn's behavior, it is essential to analyze each aspect individually. (A) Intoxicated: Quinn had too much to drink, which most likely led to a level of intoxication. When a person consumes excessive alcohol, their behavior, motor functions, and decision-making abilities are impaired. This impairment could have contributed to Quinn being kicked out of the bar. (B) Foolish: Quinn's decision to overindulge in alcohol with friends can certainly be described as foolish. By consuming too much alcohol and being unable to control their behavior, Quinn put themselves and possibly others in an uncomfortable or even dangerous situation. It is important to consume alcohol responsibly and prioritize one's well-being and safety, as well as the well-being and safety of others. Failing to do so is a display of poor judgment, which can be considered foolish behavior. (C) Very cavalier with their partying: The described scenario indicates that Quinn did not demonstrate proper restraint or consideration for the consequences of their actions. By engaging in excessive and potentially reckless partying, Quinn exemplified a cavalier attitude toward consuming alcohol and socializing with friends. This lack of seriousness and responsibility can have various negative implications, such as jeopardizing personal relationships or facing legal consequences. In conclusion, based on the provided information, Quinn can be described as intoxicated, foolish, and very cavalier with their partying. It is crucial to understand the importance of responsible drinking and the potential consequences of uncontrolled alcohol consumption. Engaging in reckless behavior can have long-lasting, negative effects on one's personal and social life, and may even result in legal problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Dead Snow Movie plot: A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II Nazi SS uniforms. Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie. The next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin. They eventually return the rest of the treasure to the box. Erlend goes to the outhouse where he and Chris have sex. Afterwards, Erlend return to the cabin, and drops a gold coin.

Movie title: La Moustache Context: This synopsis is especially detailed in the hope that it will help interpret this enigmatic film.La moustache starts with a view of waves in darkness. The first words, in darkness, are \\"What if I shaved my moustache off?\\" Now, we see Marc (Vincent Lindon) shaving, and his girlfriend Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) responds \\"I don't know you without it\\". She leaves, and he submerges in his bath water for a moment. Only then is there music as background to his shaving the moustache and thoroughly washing it down the drain. Later, there is a ring, and he starts for the door. She comes in asking \\"why didn't you let me in?\\". He waits in vain for her to notice his clean lip. Instead, she says he hasn't commented on her \\"tarty look\\". They drive to their friends Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and Nadia's (Macha Polikarpova) house, and he says to go in while he parks. Even Serge's little girl doesn't notice the missing moustache.Marc overhears Serge call Agnes two-faced, and insists on hearing the story. About 10 years ago, Serge and Agnes (Serge's ex) spent a weekend with two other couples. Serge insisted that it was clear that Agnes arranged to hog the heat, and Agnes still adamantly maintains that she didn't. This suggests Agnes might be a liar. On their drive home, Marc says \\"the joke has gone far enough\\", her pretending not to notice he shaved the moustache. She adamantly insists \\"I don't understand?.Finally in bed she yells \\"You know you've never had a moustache\\". He says she plotted with Serge and Nadia, so she phones them and they deny it. He checks their Bali trip photos which show a moustache, but she is asleep by then. Next morning, he sees her take the photos while she thinks he is asleep. He sees them later, but takes no actionThroughout the whole movie, he has proofs of his moustache but never uses them. It seems almost deliberate.

The servers were very attentive and did everything possible to make our experience memorable, and the food was wonderful. I started with the blue cheese gorgonzola souffle, which right now is being served with a stone fruit salad. (Mine was almost all peaches with a few plum slices.) By itself the souffle would have been too overpowering, but alternated with bites of the salad, it made for a very balanced dish. My main course was chicken two ways, which has been described here by others, so I'll just say that it was a wonderful choice and surprisingly filling. For dessert, I had peach-sage sorbet, which was divine! My husband is never quite as sure of himself in a fancy place like this, but he had a very good experience as well. He started with the prawns and cantaloupe, which he liked very much (although he was a little freaked out that the prawns were served entire). Next, he had the barbecued brisket, which was served with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and coleslaw. He thought the coleslaw, which contained red peppers and several other unusual vegetables, was a little strange, but he ate it all, and he thought the other components of the entree were very good.

While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700Â mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\\"The Mighty One\\"). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July. During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \\"haves\\" (to which they belong) and the \\"have-nots\\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs.

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\". In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly. Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957). In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he win any other awards?","completion":"Yes, he won several awards. For example, after his performance in the film \\"From Here to Eternity,\\" he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Most people are never really alone. Living here in New York, we're constantly surrounded by others. Even in the state's biggest wilderness, the Adirondacks, you can't get more than 15 miles or so from civilization. Similar levels of population density can be found in most of the lower 48 states. So when we heard about Heimo and Edna Korth, a couple who live 150 miles above the Arctic Circle and 60 miles from their nearest neighbors, we had to go meet them. The Korths reside in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area about the size of South Carolina in the northeast corner of the state. It is bordered by the Beaufort Sea on the north and Canada's Yukon to the east. There are other people living in the refuge -- Inuit in Kaktovik and the Gwich'in of Arctic Village -- but as far as we know, the Korths are the most isolated humans in the area. They live in the most remote location in America and sustain themselves by hunting, fishing and trapping. They've lived like this for more than 30 years, raising a family in the process and all the while dealing with grizzly bears and temperatures that dip as low as minus-50 degrees Fahrenheit. Their home turf is inhospitable in the truest sense of the word. See the rest of Heimo's Arctic Refuge at VBS.TV. As much as Heimo Korth truly is the Final Frontiersman, he's no Luddite. He uses lots of modern tools: guns, the radio, a satellite phone, a chainsaw and, most important, a gasoline-powered snow machine (a snowmobile in recreational terms) to check his miles of traps. In the wake of the BP spill, the refuge has received renewed attention from the \\"drill, baby, drill\\" crowd, which refuses to ever let a good crisis go to waste. Their claims that the refuge is uninhabited will ring particularly hollow after you watch the above video and catch a glimpse inside the Korths' lives. They are, after all, Americans and seem to be doing their own thing in their own time, which is perhaps the most American activity of all. Still, we didn't set out to make a documentary about the politics of oil drilling. That's boring and has been done a million times already. What we wanted was to tell the story of a pair of the last Americans who use well-honed skills to survive solely off the land, skills that we are losing at our own peril. The Korths supplement their myriad abilities with the benefits of oil-based products and machines. They understand the necessity of oil. We all do.

Write a summary based on this article: A half-loaded handgun, an underground bunker accessible from a wooden hatch camouflaged with dirt, and more than 1,000 bicycles tucked in a separate tunnel were discovered along the Santa Ana River trail near a former homeless encampment where residents were recently displaced, Orange County Sheriff’s Department officials said this week. The county began clearing more than 150 homeless people from the area between Warner and Edinger avenues on Nov. 7 after months of complaints from nearby condominium residents about unsanitary conditions and other nuisances at the encampment. Sheriff’s Lt. Jeff Puckett said the recent finds seem to add credence to Fountan Valley neighbors’ complaints that conditions along the river were unsafe. “We’ve collected data over the last 2½ months that shows there’s a large criminal presence in the encampments, and this evidence would seem to back that data up,” Puckett said. He said the Sheriff’s Department has made more than 260 arrests in the past several months in various encampments along the river trail in connection with crimes such as robbery, assault and trespassing. However, homeless advocates have contended the county is criminalizing homelessness and shuffling the camps’ population around instead of solving the growing problem. The county plans to permanently close the west side of the flood control channel between 17th Street in Santa Ana and Adams Avenue in Huntington Beach as it prepares to start maintenance of Orange County Flood Control District property along the trail, officials have said. Before maintenance begins, Orange County Public Works officials have been tasked with cleaning debris and trash from the former encampment in Fountain Valley. Puckett said officials found a .357 Magnum containing three empty shell casings — indicating to authorities that it had been fired — near the camp. The Sheriff’s Department is investigating where the gun came from. Courtesy of the Orange County Sheriff's Department A .357 Magnum with three expended shell casings was found along the Santa Ana River trail in Fountain Valley, police say.

(Courtesy of the Orange County Sheriff's Department) When public works crews arrived to clean up trash two weeks ago, they discovered more than 1,000 bicycles tucked into a tunnel along the concrete river bed in Santa Ana, just south of the river’s Fairview Street overpass. “I’ve been doing this job for 20 years and even I was stunned by that one,” Puckett said. Workers dragged out the bikes and hauled them to a storage yard. Puckett said the department at some point will likely allow the public to look at the bikes in an effort to reunite people with lost or stolen property. Authorities said there were indications that someone was living in the area of the bikes, but they haven’t identified whom that might have been or how and why the bikes were obtained. Authorities said they don’t know how many of the bikes might have been stolen. “Common sense would usually dictate if you have 1,000 bikes in a tunnel, some of them could be stolen,” Puckett said. On Thursday, county officials found a man-made bunker six feet underground along the trail. A plywood trap door opened to wooden steps, which led to a 10-by-10-foot living space reinforced with wood beams. The room was tall enough for an adult to stand in, authorities said.

(Courtesy of Orange County Sheriff's Department) Puckett said the bunker was empty when authorities stumbled upon it. Kris Gillan, who lives in the New Chase condominiums near the river trail in Fountain Valley, said that of all the items found, she was most surprised to hear about the bunker. “Nothing like guns, trash and needles would shock me, but the fact that someone had a whole downstairs living arrangement … it’s weird that they built it without us knowing,” she said. Gillan said she can’t believe it took officials months to begin clearing the area. “It’s like, ‘Shame on you, county — look what was going on,’” she said. “We tried to tell you.” The trail was deserted Friday afternoon. Orange bags filled with trash were lined up waiting to be hauled away. Nearby residents said most of the homeless people who had set up camp there packed up and left within three days of the county’s enforcement effort. Gillan said the area is quiet and getting cleaner every day. County officials hope to keep it that way. The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to pay California Panther Security 450,000 over the next two years to have unarmed security guards open and close gates along the trail and report trespassers to the Sheriff’s Department, according to a county staff report. hannah.fry@latimes.com Twitter: @HannahFryTCN ||||| The makeshift bunker beneath a recently-displaced Fountain Valley homeless encampment was big enough for a grown person to stand inside, replete with wood-paneled walls and a support beam, and accessible only via a small hatch camouflaged to blend in with its dirt surroundings. The half-loaded .357 Magnum found near the same camp, along the Santa Ana River, contained three empty shell casings – meaning it had been fired. More coverage: Were 1,000 hidden bikes linked to homeless? Advocates say no, county says yes And the 1,000 bicycles discovered hidden away in the flood-control channel’s dark tunnel system in Santa Ana, two miles north of the encampment, could suggest a large-scale theft ring.

Homeless men ride past a bunker that was discovered by Orange County Public Works near the Fountain Valley homeless encampment. (Photo courtesy of OC Sheriff’s Dept.) Orange County sheriff’s deputies and public employees said they uncovered unusual and dangerous conditions in the recently cleared homeless camps on the riverbed in Fountain Valley and in portions of the river to the north. The findings, they said, posed public safety risks and indicated that the area was rife with crime. “It just backs up the data that we’ve collected, which says there is a significant criminal element in the homeless encampments,” sheriff’s Lt. Jeff Puckett said. The sheriff’s department provided no evidence linking the gun or bicycles to any individuals living in the Fountain Valley encampment but said the investigation is ongoing. County employees discovered the bunker Wednesday, Nov. 16, as part of a cleanup effort after the county forced about 200 people to move out of the area five days earlier. The cavern’s hatch was concealed beneath a thin layer of dirt. But once workers opened the plywood trapdoor, they found a series of wooden steps that took them six feet underground, to a reinforced, 10-foot-by-10-foot room big enough for a 5-foot-7-inch person to stand upright. Officials don’t know how the bunker was built or who used it. “We’re not sure what (the room) was for – probably some type of living situation,” Puckett said. “It’s nothing I’ve ever seen before.” The county moved to clear the encampment, located between Warner and Edinger avenues, following months of complaints from neighbors that homeless people were trespassing, harassing residents and stealing from nearby homes. Some of the discoveries, officials said, add credence to those neighbors’ complaints and fears. The gun, for example, is of interest to investigators. Puckett declined to say where the gun was found, though he indicated it was discovered a week ago. He also couldn’t discuss if the gun was used in any open crimes or other details of the investigation. The bicycle collection also is being investigated. Though makeshift chop shops where bicycles are taken apart, cleaned and reassembled are a common sight along several portions of the lengthy riverbed homeless encampments, Pucket said he’d never seen a collection as big as the 1,000 bicycles hidden in Santa Ana. The bikes were found just south of the river’s Fairview Street overpass. Puckett wouldn’t speculate how many of the bikes were stolen, citing the ongoing investigation, saying “common sense would dictate that if you have 1,000 bikes in a tunnel… some of them were stolen.” After Public Works employees discovered the stockpile two weeks ago, workers labored to drag the bicycles out of the tunnels before hauling them off in four large trucks to a nearby storage yard. Puckett said at some point the department probably will let the public look at the cache in an effort to reunite lost or stolen bikes with their owners. Fountain Valley police Sgt. Kham Vang said the city hadn’t recently experienced an increase in bike thefts, though he noted that most bicycle thefts go unreported. But neighborhood residents offer a different story, saying they’ve noticed an increase in bike thefts and other crimes. “I’m not surprised at any of these things they found, other than the bunker,” said Kris Gillan, who owns a condo near the riverbed. “This is why we tried and tried to get (sheriff’s deputies and Fountain Valley) out there, but nothing was done for a long, long time.” She said a neighbor’s bike was stolen recently off a patio, and that she regularly saw people lurking in the complex and looking inside parked cars. As the encampment grew, she said, so did crime. “I feel safer now that they’re gone,” Gillan said. “But how did it get this bad? I hope the county has learned their lesson.” Earlier this year, the sheriff’s department and local police departments disputed which agency had jurisdiction over portions of the riverbed, leaving some areas largely unpatrolled. That changed in September, when the sheriff’s department began patrolling the Santa Ana River encampments, making hundreds of arrests. And during the past week, the county began enforcing a public-access curfew to the river trail, hiring private security guards to help enforce it. Supervisor Todd Spitzer said Thursday that the bicycles and the recovered gun were proof that “the riverbed encampments are a serious public safety concern and the county must continue to clear out these trespassers.” But as the county worked last Friday to clear the Fountain Valley encampment, many homeless people said they didn’t know where they would move. Social service workers said the action will simply push some people back to the streets of adjacent cities and force others to move to the already-crowded riverbed encampments in Anaheim and Orange, where neighbors and businesses also are complaining. Editors note: A previous version of this story quoted the sheriff’s department as saying the bicycles were found near the Fountain Valley homeless encampment. OC Public Works later clarified that the bikes were found two miles northeast of the camp, just south of the river’s Fairview Street overpass in Santa Ana. This story has been updated to reflect that information. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Police found a hidden underground bunker, a half-loaded gun and more than 1,000 bicycles near a former homeless place in Santa Ana River trail, Orange County. They have been cleaning the area after moving more than 150 homeless people due to complaints about unsafe and unhealthy conditions. The police think that the large number of bicycles could mean that some of them were stolen, but they are still investigating it.

Q:Title: Sweet Surprise Product review: If you thought 'Little Willy' and 'Ballroom Blitz' was all this band had to offer this album will make you think again. All 10 tracks are taken from the mid seventies period when Chinn/Chapman had been discarded in favour of their own compositions and some pretty muscular stuff resulted. I was never a fan of bubblegum or glam rock and that's why this collection is very agreeable. No singles. No filler. No nonsense, this is good.The guitar work is very good bordering on Purple-esque at times, especially 'Sweet F A' which reminded me of 'Speed King'. Rhythm section is tight and hard working and the vocals excellent with great harmonies. You may not recognise any of these songs but don't let that put you off.Do yourself a favour and discover the other side of The Sweet. If you like your rock hard, heavy with a mix of intellegence, then this is for you. Check out the Zep type riff of 'White Mice' just one of many delights on this album. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review certainly depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer seems pleasantly surprised by the album's content, especially since it moves away from what they perceive as the band's bubblegum or glam rock image. They highlight the strong guitar work, tight rhythm section, excellent vocals, and great harmonies, comparing the tracks to famous bands like Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. By stating that there are no singles, no filler, and no nonsense in the album, the reviewer implies that the entire collection is filled with quality tracks, showcasing the band's creative and versatile side. They encourage others to explore this lesser-known aspect of The Sweet's discography and appreciate the intelligent and heavy rock music offered by the album. The review emphasizes the album's multiple delights and recommends it to those who enjoy hard, heavy rock music with a mix of intelligence. Overall, this review paints a very positive and flattering picture of the product, indicating that the band has more to offer than just their famous hits like 'Little Willy' and 'Ballroom Blitz,' thus possibly attracting new listeners or convincing existing fans to give this album a chance."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After Arghun's death, he was followed in rapid succession by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam when he took the throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia. In 1299, he made the first of what were to be three attempts to invade Syria. As he launched his new invasion, he also sent letters to the Franks of Cyprus (Henry II, King of Cyprus; and the heads of the military orders), inviting them to come join him in his attack on the Mamluks in Syria. The Mongols successfully took the city of Aleppo, and were there joined by their vassal King Hethum II, whose forces participated in the rest of the offensive. The Mongols soundly defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, on December 23 or 24, 1299. This success in Syria led to wild rumors in Europe that the Mongols had successfully re-captured the Holy Land, and had even conquered the Mamluks in Egypt and were on a mission to conquer Tunisia in northern Africa. But in reality, Jerusalem had been neither taken nor even besieged. All that had been managed were some Mongol raids into Palestine in early 1300. The raids went as far as Gaza, passing through several towns, probably including Jerusalem. But when the Egyptians again advanced from Cairo in May, the Mongols retreated without resistance.In July 1300, the Crusaders launched naval operations to press the advantage. A fleet of sixteen galleys with some smaller vessels was equipped in Cyprus, commanded by King Henry of Cyprus, accompanied by his brother Amalric, Prince of Tyre, the heads of the military orders, and Ghazan's ambassador \\"Chial\\" (Isol the...

It has launched a new campaign focusing on the social side of sport to encourage more women to get involved. The Our Squad site lets people register activities and contact organisers. The online community unites a variety of sports, from roller derby to softball, and encourages women to get involved and try out the site's different sporting offerings. Sport Wales chief executive Sarah Powell said the campaign was about seeing sport in a different light and \\"putting fun at the forefront\\". \\"We're not telling people about sport, rather we're tapping into what motivates them to take part,\\" she said, adding a lot of women and girls surveyed said they took part for social reasons. Ms Powell added barriers women faced getting into sport included children, career and lack of confidence, but she hoped the campaign would encourage them to \\"take the first steps\\". The body drew on research from the National Survey for Wales highlighting the lower levels of female participation in sport. Sara Phillips, 12, plays for Wales' female under-13 team, and also for Carmarthenshire under-13 boys, Llanelli Cricket Club's under-15 years team, the second team and last Saturday she played for first team too. It is the first time in Llanelli's 178-year history a female has been chosen to play for the first team. Sara hopes she will inspire other girls to play cricket. \\"Sometimes they only see boys playing, but girls have more of a chance to play because there aren't many of us, so it helps us improve in sport,\\" she said. Second team captain Rhys Westcott said: \\"The point was discussed by the two club captains who felt it was the right time to bring the first girl into the teams, and Sara was the one who was chosen... we hope as more women come through, it will start a trend through the club now.\\" Our Squad is supported by ambassadors, who each have their own reason for taking part in sport. Among them is Angeline Tshiyane, 53, from Newport, who has set up a number of groups to help encourage an active lifestyle among the region's black, minority and ethnic (BME) communities. She launched her own weekly swimming sessions for children and adults from BME backgrounds, as well as the country's first female only BME walking group. \\"More women need to recognise the benefits of taking part in sport,\\" she said. \\"Not only is it great for your health, but it's a great way to make friendships and raise your confidence.\\" Angharad Sian Roche, 34, is a softball player who set up Wales' first Welsh-language team, Teirw'r Taf, which competes in the Cardiff Softball League. Ms Roche said friendship was the driving force behind the team's success. \\"You have an instant common interest and everybody taking part wants every member of the team to enjoy themselves,\\" she said, adding it was also good for \\"burning a few calories\\". Despite being told by doctors at 26 she would never run or jump again due to osteoarthritis, basketball player Caroline Matthews went on to represent Team GB at two Paralympic Games and then took up the wheelchair version of the sport. Ms Matthews, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, now coaches her own wheelchair basketball squad, Archers Wheelchair Basketball Club. Emily Roberts, 16, from Llandudno, Conwy county, suffered with low self-esteem as a result of years of bullying at school, before taking up karate aged 10 to build her confidence. Emily credits karate with helping her \\"break down the barriers she put up when she was bullied\\" and helping her to make friends. Skater Stephanie Howarth, 30, has represented Cardiff's Tiger Bay Brawlers at UK, European and American roller derby tournaments after taking up the sport five years ago following a trip to watch a game. \\"Seeing women involved in a contact sport, and witnessing the level of skill instantly made an impression on me,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable?, using the article: Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and St Michael and All Angels..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer to your friend's question is that John Douglas, the architect, showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable.

Le dysprosium se trouve généralement avec l'erbium, l'holmium et d'autres terres rares dans certains minerais comme le sable monazite. Translate to English.","completion":"This translates to: \\"It's a reducer. Dysprosium is usually found with erbium, holmium, and other rare earths in certain ores like monazite sand.\\" To provide you with a more detailed explanation: Dysprosium is a chemical element represented by the symbol Dy in the Periodic Table. It belongs to the group of Lanthanides, which are often referred to as rare earth elements. Dysprosium is characterized as a metal that is soft, lustrous, and silvery-white. One of the properties of Dysprosium is that it serves as a reducing agent, which means it donates electrons to another species in a chemical reaction. This property is often applied in various chemical reactions, particularly in laboratories and industries. The statement also mentions that Dysprosium is usually found with Erbium and Holmium, which are also part of the rare earth elements. This is true as most of the rare earth elements are often bundled together in the Earth's crust, making their separation quite a complex process. Monazite sand is a significant source of these elements. Monazite is a reddish-brown phosphate mineral that contains rare earth metals. It is an important ore for thorium, lanthanum, and cerium and contains significant amounts of other rare earth elements. Because it is highly resistant to weathering, it often accumulates in placers along with ilmenite, rutile, quartz, hematite, and other heavy minerals. These are then mined for the extraction of the rare earth elements. Therefore, the original sentence in French indicates that Dysprosium, a reducer, is usually mined alongside other rare earth elements such as Erbium and Holmium from certain ores, including monazite sand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: who was identified as the lord of misrule??","completion":"The Lord of Misrule is a term that has been used in different contexts and at different times in history, referring to a figure who presided over the chaos and revelry associated with festivals and celebrations. While there isn't one universally agreed-upon figure identified as the \\"lord of misrule,\\" the tradition typically involves the appointment of a person to oversee the festivities, games, and disorderly behavior during specific events. This individual would serve as the master of ceremonies or king for a day, presiding over wild revels that often included drinking, feasting, and the temporary inversion of social hierarchies. Here, we will cover multiple traditions where the Lord of Misrule appeared in history, each with its distinct context. 1. Ancient Rome: The concept of the Lord of Misrule can be traced back to the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which was celebrated in late December. During these festivities, Romans would engage in feasting, gambling, and general debauchery in honor of the god Saturn. In this context, the Lord of Misrule would be referred to as the \\"Saturnalicius Princeps\\" or \\"master of the Saturnalia.\\" A person was elected to hold this position and was responsible for organizing the festivities and presiding over the chaos. 2. Medieval Europe: In Medieval Europe, the Lord of Misrule often presided over winter celebrations and the Feast of Fools, which took place around January 1. The tradition was particularly popular in England and France throughout the late Middle Ages. Appointments were typically made within religious or secular institutions, and the lords of misrule held their positions for a limited time, usually from All Saints' Day (November 1) to Candlemas (February 2). During this time, the established order was temporarily overturned, and the Lord of Misrule could command even high-ranking officials to perform whimsical tasks. 3. Renaissance England: The Lord of Misrule was particularly prominent in England during the Tudor era, with Henry VIII being a notable enthusiast of the tradition. The Lord of Misrule presided over the Christmas festivities at the English court and was responsible for organizing and overseeing various entertainments such as music, plays, and masquerades. This individual was often a courtier chosen by the reigning monarch to answer to the Lord of Misrule, and their duties typically extended from All Hallows' Eve to Twelfth Night. During this period, the Lord of Misrule represented a temporary inversion of the social hierarchy and an opportunity for people to vent frustrations through indulgence and chaotic behavior. 4. Modern Revivals: Although the role of the Lord of Misrule diminished over time, some modern revivals and reinterpretations of the tradition still occur. For example, during the Mardi Gras Carnival season in New Orleans, the 'King of Mardi Gras' or 'Rex' shares some similarities with the Lord of Misrule, acting as a figurehead for the wild celebrations that are an essential part of the festival. In conclusion, the Lord of Misrule represents a figure that embodies misrule and chaos, temporarily overthrowing established social order and presiding over wild, disorderly, and indulgent celebrations. Different figures identified as the Lord of Misrule have appeared and evolved throughout human history, primarily associated with ancient Roman festivals, Medieval and Renaissance European winter celebrations, and even some modern festivities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a short story: A scientist is playing with a wind-up monkey when he notices that it goes faster over one surface than another. The surface with the most friction is (A) a marble countertop (B) a cedar coffee table. What is the most sensical answer between \\"a marble counter\\" and \\"cedar coffee table\\"? A:","completion":"The most sensible answer between \\"a marble counter\\" and \\"cedar coffee table\\" in terms of the surface with the most friction would be (B) a cedar coffee table. To elaborate, friction is a force that acts between two surfaces in contact with each other, resisting their relative motion. The amount of friction is generally influenced by the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces in contact. In general, the frictional force is greater between rough surfaces and lower between smoother surfaces. Let's examine each of the two surfaces mentioned: A) A marble countertop is a surface typically made from the metamorphic rock, marble. Marble is often polished to create an extremely smooth texture, which is a desirable quality for kitchen countertops. The polishing process involved in creating marble countertops reduces the surface roughness and, consequently, the friction between objects in contact with it. B) A cedar coffee table, on the other hand, is generally made from cedarwood. Although cedarwood is considered a softwood, it has a natural rough texture. Wood surfaces, in general, tend to have a higher friction coefficient due to the presence of microscopic grooves and fibers on the surface. Furthermore, a coffee table is less likely to be polished as smooth as a marble countertop. The natural characteristics of cedarwood and any potential lack of polishing contribute to a higher surface roughness, leading to greater friction between the cedar coffee table and any object that comes in contact with it, such as the wind-up monkey. Considering these factors, it is logical to conclude that the wind-up monkey would experience a higher level of friction on a cedar coffee table (B) than on a marble countertop (A). Thus, the most sensible answer is (B) a cedar coffee table."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

Translate to English","completion":"In this regard, they develop action plans in the field of sustainable energy. Sustainable energy refers to the production and consumption of energy resources in a manner that is environmentally friendly, economically feasible, and socially acceptable. The concept encompasses a wide range of energy sources, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies designed to minimize the negative impacts of energy generation on the planet. As countries around the world look for ways to address pressing global challenges such as climate change, air pollution, and energy security, many have turned to the adoption of sustainable energy action plans. These plans serve as blueprints for how a country or region can transition to a more sustainable energy future, with specific goals, targets, and strategies outlined for achieving these objectives. The plans often address multiple challenges simultaneously, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing energy security, and supporting economic growth and social welfare. In developing sustainable energy action plans, governments and organizations typically follow several key steps: 1. Assessment of the current energy situation: This involves an in-depth analysis of current energy use patterns, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks, as well as an evaluation of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of existing energy systems. 2. Identification of opportunities: Based on the initial assessment, stakeholders identify potential areas for improvement, such as energy efficiency measures, renewable energy deployment, or grid modernization. 3. Setting of objectives and targets: The plan establishes clear, measurable goals and targets for increasing the share of sustainable energy in the overall energy mix, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving energy security, among other aims. 4. Development of strategies and policies: The action plan outlines specific policies, programs, and initiatives that will help achieve the set objectives and targets. These may include financial incentives, regulatory changes, or public awareness campaigns, among others. 5. Implementation and monitoring: Once the plan has been finalized, it is implemented, and progress towards the set goals is monitored and reported on a regular basis. This allows for adjustments to be made as needed in response to changing circumstances or new information. 6. Evaluation and revision: Periodic evaluations of the plan's effectiveness are conducted, and any necessary revisions are made to ensure that the goals and objectives remain relevant and achievable.

'It's about his attitude now, he needs to... prove the public wrong and to win his place back for the Six Nations. \\"There's going to be a lot of pressure on him so he needs to get it right back at club level.\\" Cuthbert scored 15 tries in his first 29 appearances for Wales, including two against England in the match that clinched the 2013 Six Nations title. That form earned him a British and Irish Lions tour in 2013, where he scored a try in the first Test win over Australia.

Answer the following question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Why will stress be detrimental to a person? === The answer to the above question is Options: [-] not enough information. [-] Not allowing time for recovery. [-] Focusing on varied and interesting life experiences. [-] Allowing it to be a part of life balance. Answer:","completion":"Not allowing time for recovery. Stress can be detrimental to a person when it becomes relentless and constant, with no room for recovery and replenishment of one's mental and physical resources. While a certain amount of stress is necessary for growth and development, chronic stress can lead to burnout, negatively impacting both personal and professional life. When stress is not managed effectively and recovery time is neglected, the individual's mind and body constantly operate under pressure. This constant state of tension can result in several adverse consequences, including: 1. Physical health problems: Prolonged stress can cause a variety of health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and weakened immune system. 2. Mental health problems: Chronic stress can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and even an increased risk of developing more severe psychiatric disorders. 3. Decreased productivity: When stress is not kept in check, it can impair one's focus, creativity, and ability to make sound decisions, which can negatively affect job performance and personal life. 4. Relationship issues: Persistent stress can cause a strain on relationships, leading to conflicts, miscommunication, and emotional disconnection from loved ones. 5. Lowered life satisfaction: Living in a state of constant stress can diminish overall happiness, as the individual may feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and unable to enjoy life's simple pleasures. The key to preventing the harmful effects of stress is finding a balance between work and personal life, allowing ample time and opportunity for recovery and self-care. By actively managing stress and nurturing a balanced lifestyle filled with varied and interesting experiences, individuals can safeguard their mental and emotional well-being while still achieving professional success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Scooter\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the word \\"scooter\\" can be translated as \\"potkulauta.\\" The Finnish language, which is a member of the Finno-Ugric language family and mostly spoken in Finland and parts of Sweden, has its own unique vocabulary and grammar. While \\"potkulauta\\" specifically refers to a scooter, the word itself can be broken down into two parts for a better understanding of its meaning: 1. \\"Potku\\": This part of the word refers to the action of \\"kicking.\\" When riding a scooter, the rider usually propels themselves forward by pushing off the ground with one foot to create a kicking motion. 2. \\"Lauta\\": This portion of the word signifies \\"board\\" or \\"plank.\\" This is a reference to the flat surface on which the rider stands while operating the scooter. Together, they create the term \\"potkulauta.\\" It is important to keep in mind that, like many other languages, Finnish has numerous dialects and regional variations that might result in slight differences in pronunciation or usage. However, potkulauta is the standard and accepted term for a scooter in Finnish. The language is known for its agglutinative structure, meaning that words are often formed by attaching multiple morphemes (smaller units of meaning) together.

The man continues to aim at the sides of the cabin and shoots another man walking outside. Repeated shotgun blasts blow through the roof of the cabin but the man is out of shots for his revolver.

He also looks at the horses, seeing a familiar brand emblem. Emmett leaves the cabin and continues his journey.Far out in the desert, he comes across another man, lying on the ground in his long underwear. He gives the man some water and takes him along.

While an amazing personality could very well be one of those factors, there might also be other reasons that influence this affection.

Here is a question about this article: The Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered cease-fire was put in place in 1994. The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture 16% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself. Since then, Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks, mediated by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The status of Karabakh has yet to be determined.

In Nigeria, Oil Spills Are a Longtime Scourge Perhaps no place on earth has been as battered by oil, experts say, leaving residents here astonished at the nonstop attention paid to the gusher half a world away in the Gulf of Mexico. It was only a few weeks ago, they say, that a burst pipe belonging to Royal Dutch Shell in the mangroves was finally shut after flowing for two months: now nothing living moves in a black-and-brown world once teeming with shrimp and crab. Not far away, there is still black crude on Gio Creek from an April spill, and just across the state line in Akwa Ibom the fishermen curse their oil-blackened nets, doubly useless in a barren sea buffeted by a spill from an offshore Exxon Mobil pipe in May that lasted for weeks. The oil spews from rusted and aging pipes, unchecked by what analysts say is ineffectual or collusive regulation, and abetted by deficient maintenance and sabotage. In the face of this black tide is an infrequent protest — soldiers guarding an Exxon Mobil site beat women who were demonstrating last month, according to witnesses — but mostly resentful resignation. Small children swim in the polluted estuary here, fishermen take their skiffs out ever farther — “There’s nothing we can catch here,” said Pius Doron, perched anxiously over his boat — and market women trudge through oily streams. “There is Shell oil on my body,” said Hannah Baage, emerging from Gio Creek with a machete to cut the cassava stalks balanced on her head. That the Gulf of Mexico disaster has transfixed a country and president they so admire is a matter of wonder for people here, living among the palm-fringed estuaries in conditions as abject as any in Nigeria, according to the United Nations. Though their region contributes nearly 80 percent of the government’s revenue, they have hardly benefited from it; life expectancy is the lowest in Nigeria. “President Obama is worried about that one,” Claytus Kanyie, a local official, said of the gulf spill, standing among dead mangroves in the soft oily muck outside Bodo. “Nobody is worried about this one. The aquatic life of our people is dying off. There used be shrimp. There are no longer any shrimp.” In the distance, smoke rose from what Mr. Kanyie and environmental activists said was an illegal refining business run by local oil thieves and protected, they said, by Nigerian security forces. The swamp was deserted and quiet, without even bird song; before the spills, Mr. Kanyie said, women from Bodo earned a living gathering mollusks and shellfish among the mangroves. With new estimates that as many as 2.5 million gallons of oil could be spilling into the Gulf of Mexico each day, the Niger Delta has suddenly become a cautionary tale for the United States. As many as 546 million gallons of oil spilled into the Niger Delta over the last five decades, or nearly 11 million gallons a year, a team of experts for the Nigerian government and international and local environmental groups concluded in a 2006 report. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 dumped an estimated 10.8 million gallons of oil into the waters off Alaska. So the people here cast a jaundiced, if sympathetic, eye at the spill in the gulf. “We’re sorry for them, but it’s what’s been happening to us for 50 years,” said Emman Mbong, an official in Eket. The spills here are all the more devastating because this ecologically sensitive wetlands region, the source of 10 percent of American oil imports, has most of Africa’s mangroves and, like the Louisiana coast, has fed the interior for generations with its abundance of fish, shellfish, wildlife and crops. Local environmentalists have been denouncing the spoliation for years, with little effect. “It’s a dead environment,” said Patrick Naagbanton of the Center for Environment, Human Rights and Development in Port Harcourt, the leading city of the oil region. Though much here has been destroyed, much remains, with large expanses of vibrant green. Environmentalists say that with intensive restoration, the Niger Delta could again be what it once was. Nigeria produced more than two million barrels of oil a day last year, and in over 50 years thousands of miles of pipes have been laid through the swamps. Shell, the major player, has operations on thousands of square miles of territory, according to Amnesty International. Aging columns of oil-well valves, known as Christmas trees, pop up improbably in clearings among the palm trees. Oil sometimes shoots out of them, even if the wells are defunct. “The oil was just shooting up in the air, and it goes up in the sky,” said Amstel M. Gbarakpor, youth president in Kegbara Dere, recalling the spill in April at Gio Creek. “It took them three weeks to secure this well.” How much of the spillage is due to oil thieves or to sabotage linked to the militant movement active in the Niger Delta, and how much stems from poorly maintained and aging pipes, is a matter of fierce dispute among communities, environmentalists and the oil companies. Caroline Wittgen, a spokeswoman for Shell in Lagos, said, “We don’t discuss individual spills,” but argued that the “vast majority” were caused by sabotage or theft, with only 2 percent due to equipment failure or human error. “We do not believe that we behave irresponsibly, but we do operate in a unique environment where security and lawlessness are major problems,” Ms. Wittgen said. Oil companies also contend that they clean up much of what is lost. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil in Lagos, Nigel A. Cookey-Gam, said that the company’s recent offshore spill leaked only about 8,400 gallons and that “this was effectively cleaned up.” But many experts and local officials say the companies attribute too much to sabotage, to lessen their culpability. Richard Steiner, a consultant on oil spills, concluded in a 2008 report that historically “the pipeline failure rate in Nigeria is many times that found elsewhere in the world,” and he noted that even Shell acknowledged “almost every year” a spill due to a corroded pipeline. On the beach at Ibeno, the few fishermen were glum. Far out to sea oil had spilled for weeks from the Exxon Mobil pipe. “We can’t see where to fish; oil is in the sea,” Patrick Okoni said. “We don’t have an international media to cover us, so nobody cares about it,” said Mr. Mbong, in nearby Eket. “Whatever cry we cry is not heard outside of here.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article highlights the devastating impact of oil spills in Nigeria's Niger Delta, which has faced severe pollution for decades due to oil extraction and spills. The situation is exacerbated by aging infrastructure, ineffective regulation, and sabotage. The local population experiences little to no benefit from the oil revenue despite their region contributing nearly 80% of the government's revenue. The pollution has destroyed the once-abundant local marine life, with shrimp and crab populations disappearing. Environmentalists argue that there is potential for restoration with intensive efforts, but the issue remains largely unaddressed, sparking resentment and resignation amongst the local communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the husband of the Palestinian Christian woman's sister? is inside the article: Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle.

News article: The Senate just voted to roll back your online privacy protections. Speak up now to keep the House from doing the same thing. ISPs have been lobbying for weeks to get lawmakers to repeal the FCC’s rules that stand between them and using even creepier ways to track and profit off of your every move online. Republicans in the Senate just voted 50-48 (with two absent votes) to approve a Congressional Review Action resolution from Sen. Jeff Flake which—if it makes it through the House—would not only roll back the FCC’s rules but also prevent the FCC from writing similar rules in the future. That would be a crushing loss for online privacy. ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online. They shouldn’t be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent. We can still kill this in the House: call your lawmakers today and tell them to protect your privacy from your ISP. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. March 23, 2017, 11:36 PM GMT / Updated March 23, 2017, 11:42 PM GMT By Alex Johnson The Senate took the first step Thursday toward blocking rules that would restrict how some big tech companies share and sell your personal data, a prospect that digital activists said would be a huge loss for online privacy. On a party-line vote of 50-48, the Senate passed a joint resolution that would bar the Federal Communications Commission from enforcing rules it approved last year — when it was under Democratic control — that sought to ban internet service providers like cable and cellphone companies from selling your data without your consent. AP The vote has little immediate impact: The measure would have to pass the House and be signed by President Donald Trump before it could become law. No timetable for House action has been set. In the meantime, the FCC rules that the measure would overturn aren't scheduled to go into effect until December. If it becomes law, the measure, in effect, would preserve a two-track regulatory system that treats ISPs — the companies that connect you to the internet, which are overseen by the FCC — differently from web companies like Google and Facebook, which are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. The rules passed last year by the Democratic majority on the FCC would require ISPs to ask you explicitly to \\"opt in\\" to letting them share personal information. On web-based ad networks, data sharing is usually turned on by default and you have to dig through menus and setting and opt out of it. Related: How the Trump Administration Could Reshape the Internet Here's why that's important: Just by themselves, Google and Facebook take in 54 percent to 60 percent of all U.S. digital ad revenue, depending on who's doing the counting. More tellingly, Google and Facebook snapped up 90 percent of all new online ad spending in the first half of 2016, the last period for which complete figures are available, according to data compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers U.S. for the Internet Advertising Bureau. That leaves everybody else to fight it out for the remaining 10 percent of new ad spending. And the big cable and phone companies said the Senate vote was a step toward keeping that tiny playing field somewhat level. CTIA, formerly the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, applauded the measure's sponsors Thursday for \\"seeking a common-sense and harmonized approach to protecting Americans' privacy.\\" \\"Wireless carriers are committed to safeguarding consumer privacy, and we support regulatory clarity and uniformity across our digital economy,\\" it said in a statement. Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the newly Republican-led FCC, also welcomed the Senate vote, telling reporters afterward: \\"My own core goal is to make sure that [the] uniform expectation of privacy is vindicated through the use of a regulatory framework that establishes a more level playing field.\\" But advocates for online privacy slammed the vote. Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel specializing in surveillance and privacy issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Senate was content to \\"sacrifice the privacy rights of Americans in the interest of protecting the profits of major internet companies, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon.\\" (NBC News is a division of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corp., the nation's largest cable provider.) MACH: Protecting Your Internet Presence in the Age of Donald Trump Others noted that the measure would also bar the FCC from advancing \\"substantially similar\\" rules in the future, which Kate Tummarello, a policy analyst for the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said \\"would be a crushing loss for online privacy.\\" \\"ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online,\\" Tummarello said. \\"They shouldn't be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase and more without your consent.\\" They were joined by Mignon Clyburn, the only Democratic member of the FCC, who said the Senate measure would \\"frustrate the FCC's future efforts to protect the privacy of voice and broadband customers.\\" The vote, she said, opens up \\"a massive gap in consumer protection law.\\" ||||| The US Senate yesterday voted to eliminate privacy rules that would have forced ISPs to get your consent before selling Web browsing history and app usage history to advertisers. Within a week, the House of Representatives could follow suit, and the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission last year would be eliminated by Congress. So what has changed for Internet users? In one sense, nothing changed this week, because the requirement to obtain customer consent before sharing or selling data is not scheduled to take effect until at least December 4, 2017. ISPs didn’t have to follow the rules yesterday or the day before, and they won’t ever have to follow them if the rules are eliminated. But the Senate vote is nonetheless one big step toward a major victory for ISPs, one that would give them legal certainty if they continue to make aggressive moves into the advertising market. The Senate vote invoked the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress eliminate regulations it doesn't like and prevent the agency from issuing similar regulations in the future. For ISPs, this is better than the FCC undoing its own rules, because it means a future FCC won't be able to reinstate them. Unless the House or President Donald Trump oppose the Senate's action, ISPs will not have to worry about any strong privacy rules getting in the way of using your browsing history for profit. There won’t be any specific rules requiring them to get opt-in consent before sharing browsing history, even if that data is related to just one customer instead of being aggregated with other customers’ data in order to anonymize it. Senate Democrats warned before yesterday’s vote that ISPs will be able to “draw a map” of where families shop and go to school, detect health information by seeing which illnesses they use the Internet to gather information on, and build profiles of customers' listening and viewing history. The Senate vote was 50-48, with every Republican senator voting to kill privacy rules and every Democratic senator voting to preserve them. ISPs can’t see encrypted traffic, so if you visit an HTTPS site, ISPs will see only the domain (like https://arstechnica.com) rather than each page you visit. But that’s still plenty, said Dallas Harris, an attorney who specializes in broadband privacy and is a policy fellow at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. ISPs might be able to figure out where you bank, your political views, and your sexual orientation based on what sites you visit, Harris told Ars. “You don’t need to see the contents of every communication” to develop efficient ad tracking mechanisms, she said. \\"The fact that you’re looking at a website can reveal when you’re home, when you’re not home.” An ISP might notice that a particular tablet often visits children’s websites. From that, “they can infer that this tablet then belongs to a child” and deliver advertising targeted to kids. “The level of information that they can figure out is beyond what even most customers expect,” Harris said. How the rules have changed The legal changes all stem from the FCC's decision in February 2015 to reclassify home and mobile ISPs as common carriers. The reclassification had numerous effects: it allowed the FCC to impose net neutrality rules, but it also stripped the Federal Trade Commission of its authority over ISPs because the FTC's charter from Congress prohibits the agency from regulating common carriers. Before the February 2015 reclassification, ISPs could have been punished by the FTC for violating customers' privacy. But following the FTC rules wasn't too onerous—the FTC recommends opt-in consent before selling or sharing the most sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, the content of communications, financial and health information, information about children, and precise geo-location data. But ISPs could use an opt-out system for everything else, including Web browsing and app usage history. ISPs “want to be the advertising powerhouse.” The FCC's reclassification of ISPs removed FTC authority but imposed privacy requirements from Title II, Section 222 of the Communications Act. The problem is that Section 222 was written in 1996 for telephone service, so the FCC said it would write new broadband-specific rules explaining exactly how Section 222 would be enforced on ISPs. Those rules, including the opt-in requirements, were finalized in October 2016. Theoretically, Congress and the FCC could return jurisdiction to the FTC by eliminating the privacy rules and eliminating the ISPs' common carrier classification. But even that might not work, because a federal appeals court ruling in August 2016 said that any company with a common carrier business cannot be regulated by the FTC at all, even when they're offering non-common carrier services. The common carrier designation is also used for landline phone and mobile voice service; that means ISPs like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint could be entirely exempt from FTC oversight. Comcast and other cable companies are only common carriers for Internet service because their VoIP phones are regulated differently, so they could more easily go back under FTC oversight. But even if the FTC regains jurisdiction, its guidelines are weaker than the FCC's privacy rules. Thus, yesterday's Senate vote could leave us with no rules preventing ISPs from selling your Web browsing histories to advertisers and data brokers without obtaining opt-in consent. When AT&T charged extra for privacy The most prominent example of an ISP monetizing customers' browsing history comes from AT&T. Starting in 2013, AT&T charged fiber Internet customers at least 29 extra each month unless they opted in to a system that scanned customers' Internet traffic in order to deliver personalized ads. AT&T killed this \\"Internet Preferences\\" program shortly before the FCC finalized its privacy rules. But that doesn't mean ISPs are giving up on advertising. ISPs “want to be the advertising powerhouse, which is why they fought so hard against these rules,” Harris said. “They want to compete with Google and Facebook and other edge providers in the advertising space. This is going to be their new frontier, a new way for them to increase their profits.” ISP lobby groups have argued that privacy rules would prevent them from showing Internet users more relevant advertising via “data-driven services” and would prevent ISPs from competing in the online advertising market. They’ve argued that Web browsing and app usage history should not be classified as “sensitive” information. Advertising lobby groups, knowing that they could end up working more closely with ISPs, recently thanked Republican lawmakers for taking steps to kill the privacy rules. AT&T sells advertising via its AdWorks division, which boasts of “more targeted” ads to “more screens,” via TV set-top boxes and online video. Comcast sells online advertising that can appear on xfinity.com and NBC sites. Verizon boosted its online advertising technology when it purchased AOL and is trying to finalize a purchase of Yahoo. Because these ISPs operate their own advertising networks, they don't need to share individuals' browsing history with third parties in order to serve targeted ads. But they can use customers' browsing history to sell targeted ads. Businesses would pay the ISPs to have their advertising reach people who are more likely to buy their products, but only the ISPs would know exactly who those customers are. “They’ve already begun marketing [to advertisers], explaining how they have the ability to track you on four devices,” Harris said. “Because they’re also your cable [TV] providers, they can combine what you’re watching on TV with what you’re doing on the Internet and looking at on your phones and your tablets. They’re heavily invested in this idea that they have a lot of data that can be valuable to advertisers and want to build up that part of their business.” For ISPs that don't operate their own ad networks, getting into the targeted advertising business could involve sharing customers' browsing with third parties. The FCC privacy rules would have prevented both the internal use and sharing of such information without opt-in consent. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The US Senate has voted to abolish privacy rules which would have required internet service providers (ISPs) to secure customers’ permission before selling their web browsing history and app usage history to advertisers.

Group Brown gained a lot of weight. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. To elaborate on the reasoning behind this conclusion, we need to consider the calorie intake for each group, the storage of unused energy as fat, and the general context of obesity and BMI. Group Brown consumed 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, which translates to a significant amount of additional energy intake. As mentioned in the hint, any unused energy in food, irrespective of its source, is stored as fat in the body. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in storing almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. On the other hand, Group Yellow maintained a normal diet, which indicates that their calorie intake was likely appropriate for their energy needs. Consequently, they would not have experienced the excessive energy storage that Group Brown did, resulting in lesser fat accumulation in their body. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m2 or higher, and it increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. BMI is an estimate of the fat content in the body, calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person's height (in meters). Given that Group Brown consumed more energy than they required daily and stored these unused calories as fat, they are predisposed to a higher likelihood of gaining weight and increasing their BMI. In comparison, Group Yellow, with their normal diet, would not face the same risk of excessive weight gain and elevated BMI levels. Therefore, Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Drinkwater, now 52, of Maidenhead, Berkshire, carried out a campaign of terror over three weeks in Berkhamsted in November and December 1984. He was found guilty at St Albans Crown Court of seven charges he denied, including rape and possessing a knife. New DNA evidence helped secure the conviction. Judge Marie Catterson remanded him in custody for sentencing on 30 January. Drinkwater was convicted of the rape and robbery of a 15-year-old girl in Durrants Lane on 25 November and possessing a knife. He was found guilty of raping an 18-year-old woman and indecently assaulting another 18-year-old woman on 16 December in Bullbeggers Lane. During the attacks, in which Drinkwater wore a woollen mask, he kept saying: \\"I hate slags, tarts and lesbians,\\" the court heard. Prosecutor Ann Evans said: \\"This is a case about every woman's worst nightmare. \\"They are knife-point rapes where the perpetrator wore a balaclava and took young girls off the street late at night.\\" Mrs Evans said on 14 January this year a DNA profile from Drinkwater was provided to a forensic scientist. A swab from the 15-year-old victim was matched as \\"seven million more times likely to come from Paul Drinkwater, rather than a person unrelated to him,\\" she said. Samples taken from the trousers worn by the 18-year-old rape victim matched Drinkwater. \\"The likelihood of this sample coming from someone unrelated to the defendant was put at 1 in 43 million,\\" she said. Drinkwater lived with his girlfriend in Berkhamsted at the time and had been linked to the crimes since 1984. \\"Through advances in DNA analysis, forensic scientists were able to match the DNA from these two crimes to this defendant,\\" Mrs Evans said.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Anorexia becomes common in males.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, we cannot conclusively state that \\"Anorexia becomes common in males.\\" The information provided in the paragraph only states that anorexia in males accounted for approximately six percent of cases seen in an eating disorder clinic. This data needs to be analyzed in context with other relevant information on anorexia to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of anorexia in males. Anorexia is a serious eating disorder that affects both males and females. It is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, distorted body image, and extreme food restriction leading to significantly low body weight. In general, eating disorders are typically more prevalent in females, but cases among males also exist. The paragraph cites that around six percent of the cases seen in an eating disorder clinic were male. This figure indicates that males do indeed experience anorexia and seek treatment for it. However, to determine if anorexia is becoming common in males, we need to consider multiple factors and a wider range of statistics, such as: 1. Prevalence rates of anorexia among males in different age groups, geographic locations, and cultural backgrounds. 2. Comparisons between prevalence rates of anorexia in males and in females. 3. Trends or changes in these prevalence rates over time. Are the numbers rising, falling, or remaining steady? Furthermore, it would be helpful to analyze the contributing factors for anorexia in both genders to determine if there are any unique risk factors or protective factors associated with males. Investigating potential influences such as biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors will assist in painting a more complete and accurate picture of the prevalence of anorexia in males. In conclusion, the given paragraph highlights that anorexia is not exclusive to females and that males accounted for six percent of cases seen in an eating disorder clinic. However, this information alone does not allow us to definitively conclude that anorexia is becoming common in males. Further investigation, analysis, and contextualization of various factors and prevalence rates among different populations are required to more adequately assess the current state and trends of anorexia among males."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a \\"table\\" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing \\"sparse\\" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty.

In Europa would the state of water in higher or lower denstiy than in Earth? Scientists are finding more and more evidences of water in the outer space. Earth has mostly liquid water. But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state. On the other hand, water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in frozen state. Hint: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. The answer is:","completion":"The state of water in Europa is at a lower density than on Earth. The explanation for this lies in the differences between the water states on each celestial body. On Earth, water exists predominantly in its liquid state due to its high boiling point, which is a result of hydrogen bonds. These bonds give water the ability to support life, as liquid water is essential for all living organisms. On the other hand, water on Jupiter's moon Europa exists in a frozen state. When water freezes, its hydrogen bonds cause it to expand, leading to ice having a lower density (mass/volume) compared to liquid water. This is why ice floats on top of water, such as in lakes during winter, creating a habitat for aquatic life like fish to survive beneath the ice layer. As the water on Europa is primarily in its frozen state, its overall density is lower than that of liquid water on Earth. This difference in density results from the distinct impact of hydrogen bonds on water when it is in its frozen state compared to its liquid state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Break them down into smaller, manageable parts, and tackle each part systematically. This approach enables you to track your progress, identify errors, and understand how each component contributes to the overall solution. 6. Review mistakes: When solving problems, don't ignore your mistakes; they are valuable learning opportunities. Analyze where you went wrong, identify the cause (e.g., a misunderstanding of a concept or a calculation error), and strive to rectify the issue in future problems. 7. Use multiple resources: Supplement your math textbook with other learning resources, such as online tutorials, videos, and practice problems. Different resources may provide alternate explanations or perspectives, broadening your understanding and exposing you to different problem-solving techniques. 8. Create a study schedule: Develop a study schedule that encompasses various aspects of math study, including reviewing notes, solving practice problems, and revisiting challenging concepts. A well-rounded schedule ensures balanced progress in both understanding and application. 9. Work with others: Collaborate with classmates or join a study group to discuss concepts, solve problems, and clarify doubts. Collaborative learning promotes deeper understanding and can help you develop your problem-solving skills. 10. Seek help when needed: If you find a concept or problem particularly challenging, don't hesitate to ask for help. Reach out to your teacher, classmates, or tutor for assistance. Sometimes, a different perspective can clarify your understanding and make a seemingly complex problem straightforward. Incorporating these strategies into your math study habits will help you develop a solid understanding of the subject, enhance your problem-solving abilities, and increase your overall confidence in math. Remember, persistence and consistency are essential to success, so commit to your study plan and keep learning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is slated to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto as he tries to clarify his past comments about Mexico and immigration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is slated to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto as he tries to clarify his past comments about Mexico and immigration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Donald Trump will travel to Mexico City on Wednesday for a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, just hours before he delivers a high-stakes speech in Arizona to clarify his views on immigration policy. Peña Nieto last Friday invited both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to visit Mexico, his office said in a statement provided to The Washington Post on Tuesday night. Trump, sensing an opportunity, decided over the weekend to accept the invitation and push for a visit this week, according to the people in the United States and Mexico familiar with the discussions. Late Tuesday, Trump and the Mexican president confirmed on Twitter that they will meet Wednesday. “I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow,” Trump wrote Tuesday night. Shortly after, Peña Nieto’s office wrote that “El Señor” Donald Trump has accepted the invitation and will meet privately on Wednesday with Peña Nieto. 1 of 13 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × How Mexicans are reacting to Trump’s rhetoric View Photos Politicians, comedians, artists and developers hit back at Trump’s inflammatory speech.

Peña Nieto later tweeted that he believes in dialogue in order to “promote the interests of Mexico in the world and, principally, to protect Mexicans wherever they are.” The visit comes after Trump has wavered for weeks on whether he will continue to hold his hard-line positions on the central and incendiary issue of his campaign, in particular his call to deport an estimated 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. The people informed of Trump’s plans spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the matter. They said earlier Tuesday that talks between the Trump campaign and Mexican officials were ongoing, with security concerns still being sorted out. [Trump risks alienating voting blocs with wavering on immigration] Trump is scheduled to hold fundraisers Wednesday morning in California and deliver his immigration speech in the evening at the Phoenix Convention Center. His trip to Mexico will come between his events. The Clinton campaign shrugged off Trump’s trip as a distraction from his policies. “What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions,” wrote Jennifer Palmieri, a senior Clinton campaign adviser, in a statement. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border if he wins the election. Here's what people living along the border have to say about that wall. (Zoeann Murphy,Samuel Granados,Kevin Schaul,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) A Clinton campaign official confirmed that Clinton received a letter requesting an in-person meeting with the Mexican leader. Clinton has not yet accepted. “Secretary Clinton last met with President Peña Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials,” the aide said. “She looks forward to talking with President Peña Nieto again at the appropriate time.” The aide requested anonymity to discuss the potential meeting. The invitation is a stunning move by Peña Nieto, given the grief that Trump’s campaign has caused the Mexican government over the past year. From calling Mexican illegal immigrants rapists and criminals, to vowing to build a wall along the Southern border, to threatening to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump has caused growing alarm in Mexico. Peña Nieto himself likened Trump’s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, in a March interview with a Mexican newspaper. To the delight of his U.S. rally crowds, Trump has repeatedly promised to force Mexico to pay for his proposed border wall. Peña Nieto and other Mexican leaders have dismissed the idea as preposterous. “There is no way that Mexico can pay [for] a wall like that,” Peña Nieto said in a July interview on CNN, adding that he did not agree with Trump’s frequent characterization of illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists and killers. Trump’s newly installed campaign chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, played a key role in devising the Wednesday stop while Trump met Sunday with his aides and family at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., according to two people who have been briefed on the campaign’s deliberations. Bannon, who previously headed the conservative website Breitbart News, made the case to the group that Trump must underscore his populist immigration views in the final weeks of the general-election campaign, perhaps with an audacious gesture. [Donald Trump calls for ‘deportation force’ to remove undocumented immigrants] Peña Nieto’s invitation was brought up, and Bannon said it offered Trump an opening to make headlines and showcase himself as a statesman who could deal directly with Mexico. Trump was intrigued by Bannon’s proposal and agreed, but not all aides and allies were as enthusiastic, the people said. Trump appointed Bannon to his post and veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager this month after sidelining campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who subsequently resigned. He has been navigating a flood of conflicting advice this summer about where to land on immigration as he has publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his position. Following Sunday’s strategy session, plans came together quickly but not without hurdles and some tensions. Early this week, representatives for Trump contacted the U.S. Embassy in Mexico about his intentions, according to a person in Mexico familiar with the communications between the two sides. Trump’s representatives were told privately by officials that it would be logistically difficult for Trump to visit. But the businessman’s proxies insisted that Trump would not delay his plans, the person said. Overseas visits by senior U.S. officials normally require weeks of intricate planning on both sides, as every movement and meeting is plotted. When more security is required, such trips become even more complicated. Security staffs traveling with the visitor are usually beefed up. While Mexico is not considered a hostile place, the crime level is high, and Trump, should he appear in public, would require significant protection. The invitation — and particularly a visit — seems certain to cause a backlash in Mexico City, where Trump is widely disliked. Mexicans have bashed Trump piñatas, burned him in effigy during public street parties and staged plays about him as a comic villain. [Trump on undocumented immigrants: ‘We are going to get rid of the criminals’] When Trump declared his candidacy in 2015, he was seen by many in Mexico as insulting but not to be taken very seriously. Mexican diplomats back then scoffed at the notion that Trump was a serious candidate or that the government was worried about his ascent. That’s all changed now. Many of Mexico’s government and business elite have grown skittish about the potential of a Trump presidency and the economic damage that his policies might inflict. The United States is Mexico’s most important trading partner. Earlier this year, Peña Nieto swapped out key diplomats, including the Mexican ambassador to the United States, to have a more aggressive presence advocating for the importance of a strong relationship between the two countries. Several Mexican officials were surprised to learn on Tuesday that Peña Nieto had extended an invitation to Trump. “Wow,” one said, when reached by The Post. “This is an extraordinarily surprising, but welcome, development, whether it ends up happening or not,” said Andrew Selee, a Mexico expert at the Wilson Center in Washington. “Mexico is a vital country for U.S. foreign policy and economic interests. The second destination for exports and the country of origin of a tenth of all Americans.” Several Mexican politicians were quick to criticize the meeting. Miguel Barbosa, an opposition senator with the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution, tweeted about Trump: “Your presence in Mexico is not welcome. Get out! You come to take a photo with those you’ve offended.” “It is a political error by [Peña Nieto] to use this lying anti-Mexican,” Barbosa wrote in another tweet. A Mexican presidential hopeful with the right-wing National Action Party, Margarita Zavala, tweeted that even though Trump was invited to Mexico, he was not welcome. “Mexicans have dignity and we reject your discourse of hate,” she wrote. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox tweeted “Adios, Trump!” Trump’s Phoenix speech later Wednesday is expected to add to the day’s drama, with declarations by candidate about where exactly he stands on his immigration policy and border security. Bannon and Trump speechwriter Stephen Miller have had a heavy influence over the speech’s contours, the people familiar with the campaign said. Miller is a former aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a Trump confidant who has urged him to hold to his tough positioning and rhetoric on immigration. And while Trump’s associates have framed his speech and trip as presidential moves, the surprise gambit also fits his career-long tendency for theater and confrontation.

Moments before taking the stage for a rally in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle, Trump tweeted that he had “accepted the invitation of President Enrique Peña Nieto, of Mexico, and look[ed] very much forward to meeting him tomorrow”. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow. The meeting will happen hours before Trump is scheduled to deliver a major address on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he will aim to clarify his increasingly murky stance on the issue. It was confirmed by the official Twitter account for the Mexican presidency, which said: Presidencia México (@PresidenciaMX) El Señor @realDonaldTrump ha aceptado esta invitación y se reunirá mañana en privado con el Presidente @EPN. Translated, the tweet says that Trump “has accepted the invitation and will meet privately tomorrow with the president”. Peña Nieto – who has previously compared Trump to Hitler and Mussolini – said via Twitter that he had invited both presidential candidates to Mexico “to discuss bilateral relations”, adding: “I believe in dialogue to promote the interests of Mexico in the world and to protect Mexicans wherever they are.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto said he had invited Trump, despite having previously compared him to Hitler. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP The Trump campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment. However, Josh Green, a reporter for Bloomberg News, said Trump would be accompanied on the trip by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. Trump surrogates: Republican's position on immigration has not changed Read more Trump, who launched his campaign in 2015 with the announcement that Mexico was “bringing their worst people”, including “rapists”, to the US, had been scheduled to appear at fundraisers in California on Wednesday morning, before delivering his immigration address in Phoenix at 6pm local time (9pm ET). The trip to Mexico City to meet Peña Nieto – who has previously invited Trump to debate him in Mexico – will likely occur sometime in the middle of the day. The proposal was first broached with the US embassy in Mexico City earlier this week, a fast-tracking of an international visit by an American presidential candidate that is typically planned over the course of weeks. In recent days, Trump has been increasingly vague on his position about the legal status of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the US. During the Republican primary, Trump appealed to the conservative base by calling for a “deportation force” to remove all undocumented immigrants from the country. However, on a recent trip to Iowa, Trump said the policy issue was driven by the media. “In recent days, the media – as it usually does – has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,” he said at a fundraiser for Republican senator Joni Ernst. In front of a crowd in Everett on Tuesday evening, Trump made no mention of his upcoming diplomatic mission, focusing instead on campaign speech favorites, including a rambling story in rhyming couplets about an ungrateful and poisonous snake, intended as an allegory about Muslim refugees to the US. Also notably absent from the speech was perhaps Trump’s most essential motif: the wall he proposes to build along the US-Mexico border. Trump’s approval ratings among Latino voters are historically bad, and his relationship with Peña Nieto’s government is even worse. Trump has long pledged to force Mexico to pay for the proposed 2,000-mile (3,220km) border wall, a suggestion the Mexican president responded to coldly. “No way,” Peña Nieto told CNN earlier this year. Peña Nieto has fallen on hard political times in recent months. The latest polls put his approval rating at just 23%, according to Mexico News Daily, as the president has been hit by personal scandals, as well as allegations of human rights abuses by police officers. Protests by teachers opposed to his educational reforms have led to widespread unrest and several deaths. It is hard to see how inviting Trump to meet him would help Peña Nieto domestically, as Trump is, unsurprisingly, considerably less popular in Mexico than the president. In March, city legislators passed a non-legally binding bill to ban Trump from Mexico’s capital. Peña Nieto’s predecessor, former president Vicente Fox, has been considerably more vocal in speaking out against the Republican nominee, calling Trump’s ideas “racist” and saying “I declare: I’m not going to pay for that fucking wall.” Trump reveals plan to finance Mexico border wall with threat to cut off funds Read more A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, said the focus should remain on Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona. Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for Hillary for America, said: “From the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as ‘rapists’ and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and US citizens. He has said we should force Mexico to pay for his giant border wall. He has said we should ban remittances to families in Mexico if Mexico doesn’t pay up. “What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.” Launching his presidential bid last year, Trump claimed “the US has become a dumping ground for everyone else’s problems”, pointing the finger at Mexico. “They’re sending us not the right people,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing their problems. “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has accepted Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's invitation to visit Mexico on Wednesday, just hours before Trump is set to deliver a major immigration speech in which he is expected to clarify his stance on the issue.

Napoleon Bonaparte, having kept his guardians from killing the pair, exchanges his physicianâs services with Edmond for the delivery of a letter to a Monsieur Clarion. In Marseille, the company owner Morrell commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over First Mate Danglars, who gave Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba. Edmond states his intention to marry his girlfriend, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, whom Fernand lusts after. Fernand and Danglars inform on Edmond, concerning the letter Fernand saw Napoleon hand him, to the cityâs Magistrate, Villefort, who has Edmond arrested. Villefort prepares to exonerate Edmond until he learns the letter is addressed to his father, a Bonapartist; he burns the letter and orders Edmond locked up in ChÃ¢teau d'If. Edmond escapes, and turns to Fernand for help, but Fernand holds him up and turns him over to the pursuing gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac. Villefort has Fernand assassinate his father in exchange for persuading MercÃ©dÃ¨s that Edmond has been executed for treason and that she should take comfort in Fernand. Six years later, Edmond is startled in his cell by an eruption in the ground; another prisoner, AbbÃ© Faria, has dug an escape tunnel. For seven years Faria educates Edmond in all facets of scholarship, including swordplay, in exchange for his help in digging a new escape route.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Watch: New video shows how the Islamic State destroyed an ancient city Over the weekend, the Islamic State released a new video that seemed to confirm the extremist organization's role in the destruction of antiquities in the ancient fortress city of Hatra, a UNESCO heritage site in northern Iraq. The video shows militants chipping away at Hatra's walls, attacking carvings and statues with pickaxes and sledgehammers. In one scene, a militant wildly fires his automatic weapon at the growing debris and ruin. According to the Islamic State's puritanical creed, the \\"idols\\" of pre-Islamic civilizations are heretical, false images of divinity that must be destroyed. Iraqi authorities in March confirmed that the extremists had set about smashing and vandalizing a number of key ancient sites in the Nineveh plain, a region around the Iraqi city of Mosul that is steeped in centuries upon centuries of rich history. The international condemnation even led U.S. military officials to ponder some sort of targeted response to protect these antiquities. The Islamic State appears undeterred. \\"Islamic State has sent us to these idols to destroy them,\\" says one of the militants in the video, according to the Guardian. \\"Some of the infidel organizations say the destruction of these alleged artifacts is a war crime. We will destroy your artifacts and idols anywhere and Islamic State will rule your lands.\\" \\"Praise to God, who enabled us and the soldiers of Islamic State to remove the signs of polytheism,\\" says one Islamic State fighter toward the video's end. Until its ravaging at the hands of the extremists, Hatra was a remarkably well-preserved ancient site. It first rose to prominence in the 3rd century, probably as a garrison town for the Seleucid Empire, one of the quasi-Greek kingdoms that emerged after the death of Alexander the Great and the splintering of his short-lived empire in Asia. According to UNESCO's listing, Hatra bears the traces of a series of ancient cultures, including Roman influence as well as a succession of Persian empires. \\"The perfect condition of the double wall,\\" details the United Nations' cultural agency, \\"in an untouched environment sets it aside as an outstanding example\\" of the architecture of this period, more than 2,000 years old.

Confused council officials stormed a village pub thinking they were busting an illegal late-night gig - only to realise 4AM was the name of the band, not the starting time. Three licensing officers and two police officers raided The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, after spotting an advert promising ‘music from 4am’. The name of the band - billed as a two-piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am, and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm. 'Very confused': John Adams (left) and Joe Becket were baffled after council officials mistook their band name, 4AM, for a late-night stage time. Kate Dillon, landlady of The Feathers, said she was ‘amazed’ at the ‘sting’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from Spelthorne Borough Council. She said it was like ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’, adding: 'They turned up with two police officers and three council officers. 'I was outside at the time collecting glasses (and) I came into the pub and said: \\"What on earth is this all about?\\". 'They wanted to know if there was going to be music on until 4am and I was absolutely speechless for the first time in my life. 'I’m too old to stay up that late.' The duo, named 4am after a song by jazz legend Herbie Hancock, is made up of singer John Adams and drummer Joe Becket. Mr Adams said everyone was ‘very confused’ about the raid, adding: 'This has never happened to us before. Raided: Customers and staff at The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, were stunned to see police and council inspectors charge in. 'We’re called 4am after one of our favourite tracks by Herbie Hancock. That’s how we got the name, it’s from the album Mr Hands. 'When we were looking for a name that was our favourite album. We play stuff to get the ladies dancing, it’s all dance and soul.' Simon Freeman, 32, was at the gig when the raid took place - and said it was ‘totally ridiculous’. He said: 'These two police officers came in with these three guys from the council and they were very confrontational. 'You should have seen their faces when they realised the name of the band was 4am, not the time of the gig - they shot off with their tails between their legs. 'It will take quite a while for them to live this one down.' A spokesman for Spelthorne Borough Council admitted yesterday that its officers had made an error after spotting a poster for the gig earlier this month. He said: 'Following a visit to The Feathers, there was no cause for concern. The visit was carried out after seeing an advertisement which mentioned 4am.

Let's analyze the sentence in detail to ensure both syntax and semantics are adhered to: 1. Syntax: Syntax in a sentence refers to the grammatical rules and structure that dictate how words are combined to create meaningful phrases, clauses, and sentences. A sentence must follow basic rules of syntax, such as subject-verb agreement, coherent word order, and proper tense usage, to be considered acceptable. Let's examine the sentence elements: - Subject: \\"Fanny\\" - It is a proper noun, which serves as the main subject of the sentence. It provides information on the person who is engaging in the action mentioned. - Verb: \\"loved\\" - This verb acts as the predicate of the sentence, which describes the action the subject performs. In this case, we have the past simple tense of the verb \\"love,\\" which indicates a completed action or a general preference in the past. - Gerund: \\"talking\\" - Derived from the verb \\"talk,\\" it functions as a noun to describe the activity that Fanny loved. - Preposition: \\"to\\" - This preposition indicates a direction or the recipient of the action of the verb. It connects the object of the sentence, \\"Mary,\\" with the gerund \\"talking.\\" - Object: \\"Mary\\" - Another proper noun, which serves as the recipient of Fanny's action, making the sentence meaningful. The sentence features proper subject-verb agreement, correct word order, and appropriate tense usage, making it syntactically acceptable. 2. Semantics: Semantics refers to the meaning conveyed by words, phrases, and sentences. A semantically acceptable sentence should provide clear meaning, without contradictions or ambiguities. In the sentence \\"Fanny loved talking to Mary,\\" it is evident that the subject, Fanny, had a fondness for the specific activity of talking to another person - Mary. The meaning is clear and coherent, without any ambiguities or contradictions. There is a logical relationship between the words and the ideas they represent, which contributes to the overall meaning. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Fanny loved talking to Mary\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable as it adheres to grammatical rules and conveys a clear and coherent meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These compounds are generally stable and less reactive due to the presence of strong C-C single bonds and C-H bonds. The simplest hydrocarbons are Methane (CH4), Ethane (C2H6), Propane (C3H8) and Butane (C4H10). Methane is the simplest of them all with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. On the other hand, unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one carbon-carbon double or triple bond which makes them more reactive than saturated ones.

Part #2: Understanding the concept of a neutral choice. Usage: A neutral choice is a sentence that neither agrees nor disagrees with the statement. It should not echo what is stated, nor should it contradict it. In this case, choice number 1, \\"Records such as these are very valuable, but are not seldom available to the public for review.\\" is the neutral choice because it neither affirms nor denies the value of records in risk assessments and budgetary decisions.

The Sanada-maru was an earthwork barbican defended by Sanada Yukimura and 7,000 men, on behalf of the Toyotomi. The Shogun's armies were repeatedly repelled, and Sanada and his men launched a number of attacks against the siege lines, breaking through thrice. Ieyasu then resorted to artillery as well as men to dig under the walls. On 22 January the Winter Siege was ended, with Toyotomi Hideyori pledging to not rise in rebellion. He also allowed Ieyasu to tear down the walls of the outer layer of defenses, and fill in the outer moat of Osaka Castle. What did Ieyasu's forces do later, destroy the fort by the Kizu River or attack Imafuku?","completion":"Ieyasu's forces first destroyed the fort by the Kizu River on 19 November, and then a week later, they attacked the village of Imafuku."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Based on the premise \\"It took him five shots to hit what had taken Jon five hundred.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"He shot and hit it way quicker than Jon could. \\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"It took him five shots to hit what had taken Jon five hundred,\\" we can examine and evaluate the hypothesis \\"He shot and hit it way quicker than Jon could\\" by taking a closer look at the context and the details provided. Firstly, let us consider the numerical differences in the shots taken by both individuals. By taking only five shots to achieve a specific goal, when Jon had taken 500 shots to achieve the same, \\"he\\" displays a significantly better result in comparison to Jon. In fact, there is a 100-fold difference in the number of shots taken by both. This disparity in their performance supports the hypothesis that \\"He shot and hit it way quicker than Jon could.\\" However, before drawing definitive conclusions, it is essential to consider the potential factors that can affect the results. Some of these factors could include: 1. Skill level: The person who took only five shots might have a higher skill level or is more experienced in the task than Jon, which would drastically impact the results' accuracy in supporting the hypothesis. 2. Context: The context in which these shots are taken is crucial, as it could provide critical information about the circumstances. For example, if Jon faced adverse conditions while attempting the task or was taking blindfolded shots, it might not be a fair comparison. 3. Repeated attempts: We must also consider whether this premise refers to a single instance or multiple instances. If it was a lone occurrence and \\"he\\" replicated this feat consistently, the hypothesis would be strongly supported. However, if Jon outperforms him on other occasions, the hypothesis might not be as solid. 4. Other external factors: Factors such as luck, equipment used, or psychological state are also worth considering while evaluating the hypothesis, as these can impact the overall performance of both individuals. In conclusion, based on the premise given, we can tentatively agree that the hypothesis \\"He shot and hit it way quicker than Jon could\\" is true. However, a more comprehensive analysis involving the variables mentioned above would be required to solidify this assertion and eliminate potential biases resulting from the performance comparison."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What is a child's reaction likely to be when going to play?

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"In a later symbol, we will return to the explanation of these cosmic spiral sections. As we delve deeper into the understanding of cosmic spirals and their sections, it is essential to note that these fascinating formations are among the many wonders of the universe. Cosmic spirals can be found in various celestial bodies, including galaxies and planetary systems, and they have a significant influence on the formation, structure, and evolution of the cosmos. Cosmic spiral sections, which can be observed and studied through varying symbols, serve as a visual representation of these spirals. These sections provide important information about the geometry, dynamics, and interactions within the spiral structures. Understanding the intricacies of these sections will enable us to gain a better grasp of the forces governing the universe and our place within it. To comprehend the concepts behind cosmic spirals and their sections further, let’s look at some fundamental ideas: 1. Formation and structure: Spiral galaxies, such as the Milky Way, exhibit a flat, rotating disk containing a mixture of stars, gas, and dust. This disk displays a spiral pattern that can extend outward from the central nucleus, creating a series of spiral arms that are separated by gaps. The exact process involved in the formation of these spiral structures is still a point of active research and remains somewhat of a mystery. 2. Dynamics: The spiral patterns visible in galaxies are not static features; instead, they are continually changing and evolving. The motion of stars and interstellar material within these spiral arms is influenced by various forces, such as gravity, galactic rotation, and the presence of dark matter. Understanding how these forces interact within the cosmic spiral sections will provide insight into the mechanics governing these structures. 3. Wave patterns and resonances: One popular theory for the formation of spiral arms in galaxies is the density wave theory. According to this concept, spiral arms are the result of density waves propagating through the galactic disk. These waves trigger the formation of new stars and aggregations of matter within the spiral arms. The resonance between these density waves and the motions of individual celestial bodies within the spiral sections contributes to the maintenance and development of the spiral pattern. When we return to the explanation of cosmic spiral sections at a later point, it is crucial to explore these key points and other factors that contribute to the vast complexities of the universe. By examining the science behind these fascinating phenomena, we will continuously enrich our knowledge of the cosmos and the many intricacies of its structure."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for \\"comics\\" in different languages.

Here are some concepts: building, function, wall What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"A building is essentially a man-made structure used for various purposes, ranging from residential to commercial, industrial to public utility. The concept of a building can encompass various forms, such as houses, skyscrapers, schools, hospitals, churches, factories, and more. It's an enclosed space that provides shelter, security, and comfort, where people can live, work, learn, and perform other activities. The primary function of a building varies according to its design and purpose. Some buildings are designed for residence such as houses, apartments, or condominiums, while others are made for commercial purposes like offices, shops, and malls. There are also buildings specifically designed for industrial use like factories and warehouses; and for public and community purposes such as schools, hospitals, churches, and government institutions. Moreover, buildings can also serve secondary functions, like a residential building may also accommodate a home office or a commercial building may include residential areas. So the function of a building is mainly determined by human needs and societal demands. One of the vital elements in a building is the wall. Walls function as a physical and sometimes visual divider between different spaces. They give form to the building, separate interior spaces, support the roof and, sometimes, upper floors of the building. Walls also play a significant role in controlling the indoor climate of a building. They are designed to prevent the entry of rain, wind, heat, or cold into the building. Moreover, walls are usually designed to resist lateral forces that could cause the building to collapse. They also provide privacy, security, and prevent the spread of fire. Furthermore, they often accommodate important building functions such as insulation, included utilities like plumbing or wiring, and can also be aesthetic elements in a building's design. For instance, some walls can be made from glass, giving the building a modern aesthetically pleasing look while also allowing natural light to enter the building, which can be essential in reducing energy costs. In addition to their physical aspects, these elements have more profound social, economic, and environmental implications. Buildings cater to the need for spaces where society can live, interact, and conduct activities that contribute to the economy. Also, the design, construction, and function of buildings have substantial impacts on the environment pertaining to the use of resources, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the concepts of building, function, and wall are not just physical constructs but are also interpreted in the broader context of societal, economic, and environmental dimensions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solution:","completion":"Task Explanation: 1. Identify the target profession: In this problem, the target profession is 'tailor'. 2. Read the two sentences: The two sentences are: a. Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy. b. John LeCarre should win the Pulitzer for fiction. 3. Determine if the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated with respect to the target profession and the first sentence. a. A stereotype would be a widely held but oversimplified notion of tailors. b. An anti-stereotype would be an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of tailors. c. Unrelated means there is no connection between the target profession, the first sentence, and the second sentence. How to find the answer: 1. Look for any mention of the target profession (tailor) in the second sentence. 2. Assess if the second sentence contains a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated idea about the target profession. 3. If none of the criteria for a stereotype or anti-stereotype is met, determine that the sentences are unrelated. Solution: The second sentence, \\"John LeCarre should win the Pulitzer for fiction,\\" is unrelated to the target profession 'tailor' and the first sentence. There is nothing in the second sentence that reflects a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or any connection to tailors. Hence, the answer is Unrelated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. \\"not guilty\\"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of \\"not proven\\", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales and Canada the mechanism for this is a discharge. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable. There... - An ambush is a long-established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from ancient to modern warfare. In the 20th century, an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a mountain pass, or a small guerrilla band or insurgent group attacking a regular armed force patrol. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - Charles Swan ( died 1690 ) was a reluctant buccaneer . Captain Swan was forced into piracy by his crew in the 1680s , and proceeded to write letters to the owners of his ship Cygnet in London , begging them to intercede with James II of England for his pardon - even as he looted his way up and down the coast of South America . He was present at the attack on Payta in 1684 , where he petulantly burned the town after no booty was found . On 25 August 1685 , he separated from his confederates Peter Harris and Edward Davis , and sailed up the coast of Mexico , but met with little success . He seized the town of Santa Pecaque but lost fifty men to a Spanish counter-attack , including Basil Ringrose . On 31 March 1686 he set out across the Pacific to ambush the Manila treasure galleon , but failed to over-take the ship . Due to the failure of the assault on Santa Pecaque provisions were short , and by the time they reached the East Indies the crew were plotting to eat their officers of the Cygnet as it crossed the Pacific ( starting with the Captain ) . ( Swan is reported to have remarked that the lean William Dampier would have made them a poor meal ; the captain himself was a remarkably fat man . ) Fortunately they arrived at Guam without resorting to cannibalism , and made their way on to the Sultanate of Mindanao . The arrogance of Swan and unruliness of his men soon spoiled their good relations with the local ruler , Raja Laut ; and when the captain decided to abandon the attempt on the galleon , his men mutinied . He managed to save five thousand pounds ( legally the property of the Cygnet 's owners ) from the mutineers , and remained in Mindanao , becoming an officer in Laut 's army ; but in 1690 he attempted to escape back to England on a Dutch ship with the money , and was chased by Laut 's warriors , who capsized his boat and speared him in the water . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Buccaneers were pirates of the Caribbean Sea who challenged Spanish hegemony on the region by attacking ships and sacking coastal settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Before long, they became a threat to non-Spanish settlements as well, and the target of anti-piracy crusades. Today the idea of a buccaneer plays a role similar to \\"pirate\\". Original buccaneer crews, however, were larger, localized to the Caribbean region, and more apt to attack well-defended ports than pirates who sailed to the Indian Ocean on the Pirate Round of the late 17th century. - James II and VII (14 October 1633 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. - A pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if never convicted. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - The Sea Peoples were a purported seafaring confederation of groups known to have attacked ancient Egypt prior to the Late Bronze Age collapse. Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of Wilhelm Max Müller: \\"the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations\\". - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. - Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship- or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic strictures facilitated pirate attacks. A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes. Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pirate Round was a sailing route followed by certain Anglo-American pirates, mainly during the late 17th century. The course led from the western Atlantic, around the southern tip of Africa, stopping at Madagascar, then on to targets such as the coast of Yemen and India. The Pirate Round was briefly used again during the early 1720s. Pirates who followed the route are sometimes referred to as Roundsmen. The Pirate Round was largely co-extensive with the routes of the East India Company ships, of Britain and other nations. - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - A privateer was a private person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, also known as a letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission. Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. During war, naval resources were auxiliary to operations on land so privateering was a way of subsidizing state power by mobilizing armed ships and sailors. - Commerce raiding is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. It is also known, in French, as guerre de course (literally, \\"war of the chase\\") and, in German, Handelskrieg (\\"trade war\\"), from the nations most heavily committed to it historically as a strategy. - Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. At common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word \\"rob\\" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g. \\"deraubare\\") of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic \\"raub\\" -- \\"theft\\". - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. What is the relationship between 'charles swan ' and 'privateer'? Answer:","completion":"Charles Swan was a reluctant buccaneer and a captain during the late 17th century. He was forced into piracy by his crew, which involved attacking and looting ships and coastal settlements along the coast of South America. In the context of privateering, Swan's situation was unique, as he did not willingly engage in piracy and even sought a pardon from the English authorities. Privateers, on the other hand, were private individuals or ships that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war, also known as a letter of marque. This authorized them to attack enemy vessels during wartime and capture them as prizes. Although privateers engaged in similar activities as pirates, they were legally sanctioned by their governments, making their actions legitimate forms of war. In summary, Charles Swan was a buccaneer captain who was forced into piracy by his crew, while privateers were state-sanctioned individuals or ships that engaged in maritime warfare. Although their actions were similar, privateers had legal authorization for their activities, unlike Swan, who sought a pardon for his piracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife?, using the article: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife is Barbirolli.

Question: Given the below context: Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains.

Choices: - unsaturated - hdl - insulin - ldl A: A:","completion":"The type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \\"bad\\" is LDL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. To understand why LDL is considered bad, it is essential to know what cholesterol is and how it functions within the body. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is present in all cells of the body. It plays an essential role in various bodily functions, such as the production of hormones, cell membrane formation, and nutrient digestion. However, when cholesterol levels become unbalanced, it can lead to health issues, specifically cardiovascular diseases. There are two primary types of cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Each type has a unique role and function in the body. 1. High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Often referred to as \\"good\\" cholesterol, HDL is responsible for carrying cholesterol from other parts of the body back to the liver. The liver then processes and removes it from the body. Higher HDL levels are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease because it helps clear excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. 2. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): LDL is considered \\"bad\\" cholesterol because it transports cholesterol from the liver to the rest of the body. When there is too much LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, it can lead to the formation of plaque in the arteries. Plaque is a buildup of cholesterol, fats, and other substances that can narrow and harden the arteries, obstructing blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Although LDL cholesterol is necessary for the proper functioning of the body, elevated levels of it can be harmful. Factors contributing to high LDL cholesterol levels include an unhealthy diet (high in saturated and trans fats), lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, and genetic predisposition. In some cases, high LDL cholesterol levels may also be caused by an underlying medical condition, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or kidney disease. Maintaining a proper balance between HDL and LDL cholesterol is vital for overall health and well-being. Lifestyle modifications, such as adopting a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, can help manage cholesterol levels. In some cases, medication and medical interventions may also be necessary for individuals with persistently high LDL cholesterol levels. In summary, LDL cholesterol is the type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \\"bad\\" because high levels of it can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by contributing to plaque buildup in the arteries. Maintaining a healthy balance between LDL and HDL cholesterol is essential for a healthy cardiovascular system and overall bodily function."},{"prompt":"Information: - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details.

No fringe benefits for emos as haircuts that flop over one eye could result in generation of young people with lazy eyes UNDER all those long lopsided fringes, a hidden danger is lurking. A leading optometrist has warned children and teenagers are risking their eyesight for the sake of fashion.

Photos: Reece Mastin Photos: Justin Bieber Optometrists Association national executive member Andrew Hogan warned amblyopia - the medical term for lazy eye - could result from obstructed vision caused by hair. \\"If a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time, that eye won't see a lot of detail,\\" Mr Hogan said. \\"And if it happens from a young age, that eye can become amblyotic.\\" Mr Hogan said the most vulnerable age for visual development was birth to seven years, but research had shown vision could still be affected at later stages. As well as the potential damage to eyesight, there are also concerns that long \\"emo\\" sweep fringes could cause postural problems. Veteran hairdresser Roseanne Anderson fears the hairstyle forced many to tilt their heads to one side in order to see out of their small window of vision. \\"I have to wonder how they don't get a stiff neck,\\" the Hobart-based hairdresser said. \\"I have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when I think about it, this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing that could be a health hazard.\\" Mr Hogan said a curtain of hair over one eye could actually act like an eyepatch, limiting the eye's access to both sunlight and sensory stimulation. He said recent research had shown a lack of direct sunlight resulted in short sightedness. And hair constantly hanging over one eye could result in sensory deprivation that could weaken one eye and lead to amblyopia. \\"If you walk around with an eye patch on all day, then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye,\\" he added.

The bombing of Pearl Harbor, a surprise military attack, took place on December 7, 1941. It was carried out by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This event led to the United States' entry into World War II. The attack began at approximately 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time and was executed in two waves. The first wave targeted airfields and battleships, while the second wave focused on other ships and shipyard facilities. In total, the attack lasted about two hours, resulting in significant devastation and loss of life. The United States suffered the loss of 2,403 personnel, while 1,178 others were wounded. Additionally, eight battleships, three cruisers, four destroyers, and several aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Regarding the captured Japanese sailor you mentioned, his name was Kazuo Sakamaki. Sakamaki was one of the ten Japanese sailors who tried to execute suicide attacks against US ships by using midget submarines during the Pearl Harbor attack. However, Sakamaki's mission did not go as planned. His submarine faced various issues, including being spotted by a destroyer and issues with firing torpedoes.

Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together. That is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\" Trump also lashed out at opposition Democrats and tried to blame them for recent administration actions to separate family members caught trying to come across the U.S. border. “The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children,\\" Trump said. Question: When did Trump launch an attack on the Russia probe? Answer: Available choices: 1.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write some highlights for the following article: Springwood teenagers Dean, Kris, Jesse, Nancy and Quentin are having trouble not sleeping: They're knocking back coffee, popping pills, anything to delay another date with their dream stalker (which may explain why these high school students look like college grads). When one of them does drop off, the bedsheets turn red. Wes Craven's 1984 slumber party massacre started from scratch -- it was a low-budget item from what was then a genuine independent studio, New Line -- and became the iconic horror franchise of the decade. With his battered fedora, a striped sweater, a razor-glove and a face like Sal's Famous, Freddy Krueger was the most personable boogie man Hollywood had come up with in a long time, so what if he was also a child abuser? A recurring nightmare who stalked teenagers as they slept, Freddy preyed on the defenseless and played fast and loose with physics: If Salvador Dali had created a slasher movie villain, he might have come up with someone like Freddy. After eight movies, a TV series and a comic book, you might think Mr. Krueger had been done to death. It's been seven years since Freddy put Jason Vorhees in his place (in \\"Freddy vs Jason\\"). But you can't keep a good bad guy down, and at the rate Hollywood is cannibalizing its horror back catalogue, we'll be seeing remakes of the remakes any day now. Directed by pop video director Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer, the new \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" is actually a lot like the old one. So much so, for a while you wonder why they didn't just re-release it. (You'll wish they had.) Surprisingly, Bayer doesn't go the Michael Bay route and give it a high-gloss, ADD tempo, but in duplicating the most memorable bits from the original (the glove in the bath, for instance, and the face coming through the wallpaper), he fails to put his own stamp on it. As Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley, who was Oscar nominated for playing a sex offender in \\"Little Children\\" (and who went on to play Rorschach in \\"Watchmen\\" and the battered psychopath Noyce in \\"Shutter Island\\") finds Robert Englund a tough act to follow. Haley drops his voice an octave and comes on heavy -- this Freddy mostly keeps his quips to himself -- but he's significantly shorter than Englund, and the make-up suggests nothing so much as Ray Bolger in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\": the scarecrow who didn't even scare the crows. iReporter gives new \\"Nightmare\\" an \\"A\\" Branching out tentatively toward something new, the film toys with repressed memory syndrome and the intriguing suggestion that maybe Freddy was innocent; that he has every right to be angry about the lynch mob that incinerated him. I'll leave you to imagine how far the filmmakers go with that radical notion, but maybe a prequel would have been a more rewarding way to go? The new \\"Nightmare\\" also proudly introduces a clinical-sounding term called \\"micro-naps,\\" a side effect of sleep deprivation that handily justifies more shock effects even as the number of survivors is whittled down to two (gratifyingly, they're the least synthetic of the young cast members). But is it scary? Barely. In the wake of \\"Paranormal Activity,\\" Freddy's grandstanding theatrics seem pretty old hat. There is nothing about this redundant remake to give anyone sleepless nights, unless it's threat of yet more of the same old same old. Enough with the \\"re-imagining,\\" Hollywood; just imagine! Highlights:","completion":"1. \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" remake directed by Samuel Bayer pays homage to Wes Craven's iconic 1984 slumber party massacre. 2. Despite using similar memorable scenes as the original movie, the remake fails to provide a fresh perspective. 3.

BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago. That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy. Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines. In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books. Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources. Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market. The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors. Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world. There are ten times as many newspapers and magazines because _ . A) the publishing houses want to make more money. B) there are more readers along with the bigger population. C) economic and education have developed under the policy. D) the legal system overseeing the publishing industries has changed.","completion":"The number of Chinese newspapers and magazines have increased ten times compared to 30 years ago because of several factors: 1.

With the transition to a market economy, numerous publishing houses and newspapers have restructured their management systems, resulting in the establishment of corporations that are listed on the stock market.

Ina Garten On How To Run A Business And Do What You Love Ina Garten, beloved host of Emmy Award-winning show Barefoot Contessa and author of bestselling cookbooks such as How Easy Is That?, knows a thing or two about cooking up a storm with a smile. “You want to do something you love doing, whether you are getting paid for it or not, if you can,” said Garten, speaking at Forbes’ third annual Women’s Summit, a gathering of hundreds of women entrepreneurs and leaders in New York with the aim of changing the power imbalance in the business world. As Forbes Woman publisher Moira Forbes told a packed house at Manhattan’s Chelsea Piers, Garten transitioned from working in the White House on the budget for enriched uranium programs to running her own small business, a specialty food store in her adopted home in the Hamptons. Garten described her fatigue with Washington, and her motivation for switching careers: “I was thinking, life has to be more fun than this.” Encouraged by her husband Jeffrey, who is often the quiet star of Garten’s home cooking show, Garten decided to pick something she enjoyed. “If it’s fun, you’ll be really good at it,” Garten assured. Garten bought a small store after making an offer she didn’t think the proprietor would accept: “She called me and said ‘Thank you very much, I accept your offer’ and I went, ’Oh, shit.’” The audience erupted in laughter hearing the composed Garten swear, but took note as she shared small business advice. “Starting small and buying a business already in progress made it possible for me,” Garten said, recalling that she would find herself working many long hours perfecting new recipes. It wasn’t all a piece of cake – Garten was selling food in store and catering, but eventually stopped the latter because it was too draining. After two decades running the Hampton staple, Garten decided to change everything – for the second time. “I was 50 years old and I thought the best years of my career were over,” Garten, 67, said. “It wasn’t stimulating to me and I tried to figure out what to do next.” So the Barefoot Contessa sold her store to two employees, bought an office above it, and did nothing for the first time ever. “Type A people think they can figure out what to do next while they’re doing something, and they can’t,” Garten advised, beaming at the crowd. “An important part of changing and figuring out what to do next is you have to just stop. I had to get good and bored before I could decide what was next – I thought maybe I’ll write a cookbook while I figure it out.” Garten invested heavily in her first publication, 1999′s “The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,” by hiring her own photographer and publicist to retain control of the project. “Marth Stewart said, ‘Go to book stores and ask to sign books,’ so I went to the head of this book store in Newport, California, and said, ‘I’ve written a book, would you like me to sign it?’” The manager agreed, but realized the store had already sold out for the day. “That was the moment I though, ‘Oh, this might work.’” From the cookbook, cooking show requests followed. But it was not until 2002 that Garten transitioned from print to small screen. “I just didn’t think I would be good at it. I’d seen Martha [Stewart] and Nigella Lawson and I just never saw myself as a teacher,” recalled Garten, in an important reminder not to underestimate oneself. Garten, who has published nine recipe books to date, remains modest about her television success: “I do the TV because it’s an important part of the business, but it’s the cookbooks I love writing.” She reminded the accomplished audience that ‘no’ is a complete sentence and making time for oneself is equally important. “I think when we’re young we say yes to everything, but when you realize your brand is working, you start making choices,” said Garten, who says she turned down frozen dinner and dog food deals among others because they did not fit with her fun cooking style. “Oscar Wilde used to say, ‘work is easy, fun is hard’” Garten pointed out. “You know what you need to do for work but it’s the personal life that gets what’s left over, rather than vice versa.” To avoid burnout, Garten suggests planning downtime a year in advance, and credits these breaks with giving her some of her best ideas. “Jeffrey and I go away two weeks at a time two to three times a year.” As the conversation came to a close, Garten gave poignant advice to her twenty-something self: “Do what you love. If it’s fun, you’ll be really good at it. And don’t worry so much.” Follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me anyway. Does it follow that \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions.\\"?","completion":"In order to determine if the statement \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions.\\" follows this statement: \\"If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me anyway,\\" let's break down the original statement and analyze its components. 1. Analyze the original statement: \\"If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me anyway.\\" The original statement conveys that, regardless of whether the speaker agrees or not, there is a high probability that the listener will take action and make corrections anyway (using the metaphor of re-shoeing the foreleg of a horse). Here, \\"trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me\\" implies that the listener may try to fix something or take a certain action irrespective of the speaker's agreement. 2. Compare the original statement to the new statement: \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions.\\" The new statement implies that the listener will achieve success or complete a task, regardless of what the speaker thinks or feels. While there is a thematic similarity between the two statements, as both express a sense of determination on the part of the listener, there are some differences as well. 3. Determine if the new statement follows the original statement: The original statement implies that the listener will likely take action to correct an issue, regardless of the speaker's agreement. The new statement suggests that the listener will succeed in their endeavor, irrespective of the speaker's opinions. While there are similarities, the new statement focuses more on the certainty of success against the speaker's opinions, whereas the original statement revolves around the listener's action in the face of disagreement. Conclusion: The new statement, \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions,\\" doesn't exactly follow the original statement, but it does share a related theme. Both statements convey the listener's determination and willingness to act, even if the speaker doesn't agree or holds a different opinion. However, the new statement emphasizes the listener's success, while the original statement highlights the action of fixing or correcting something."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What is affirmative action trying to fix?\\" Context: \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\" Answer:","completion":"Affirmative action aims to address and remedy past discrimination and promote diversity by providing opportunities for underrepresented groups in various areas such as education, employment, and government contracts. However, critics argue that it may benefit mostly middle-class minorities and can lead to negative consequences such as self-doubt, entitlement, exploitation of group preferences, and animosity towards preferred groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, water for those in drought-stricken northwestern China can't be taken for granted. Its present shortage is a matter of life and death to them. The tragedy is the direct result of the drought that has hit a large area of northwestern China, and is affecting more than 50 million people. The drought began last spring, ravaging Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which country had higher gold reserves, Russia or Japan?","completion":"Title: Gold Reserves in Russia and Japan: A Comparison Introduction Gold reserves reflect the economic stability and financial strength of a country. These reserves are compelling indicators of a nation's capability to handle market fluctuations and strengthen its currency, particularly in times of crisis. Russia and Japan have been economic powerhouses in their respective regions and the world. As such, it is vital to understand their gold reserve positioning to gain insight into their overall financial status. This article seeks to answer the question: Which country had higher gold reserves, Russia or Japan? Russia's Gold Reserves Russia has persistently been among the top gold reserve holders globally. According to the World Gold Council, as of October 2021, Russia held about 2,296.5 metric tons of gold in its reserves, making it the fifth largest holder in the world. The country has made a strategic move in recent years to increase its gold reserves as part of its effort to reduce its reliance on the US dollar while coping with the economic sanctions imposed on it. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has been active in purchasing gold to stabilize its financial system and diversify its reserves away from foreign currencies, particularly the US dollar. This move has allowed Russia to strengthen its economy and mitigate potential risks caused by geopolitical tensions and market volatilities. Russia is also endowed with abundant gold resources, ranking third in global gold production in 2020. This has facilitated direct procurement of gold by the CBR from domestic mines, significantly contributing to its gold reserves. Japan's Gold Reserves Japan has a substantial amount of gold reserves as well. As of October 2021, Japan possessed approximately 846.9 metric tons of gold, ranking as the ninth largest holder in the world, according to the World Gold Council. However, Japan's approach to gold reserves reflects its conservative monetary policy and emphasis on foreign currency reserves. While gold plays a vital role in Japan's reserves, the nation prioritizes maintaining large amounts of foreign currency reserves, predominantly held in US Treasury bonds. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has consistently maintained its gold reserves at a more or less static level for the past few decades, showcasing its preference for stability and minimal fluctuations. Japan's massive holdings of foreign currencies have contributed to the strength and stability of the yen, demonstrating the efficiency of its monetary policy. Comparison and Conclusion In response to the question, it is clear that Russia currently has higher gold reserves when compared to Japan. With over 2,296.5 metric tons of gold, Russia has managed to secure the fifth-highest position in gold reserves globally. In comparison, Japan's 846.9 metric tons make it the ninth largest holder in the world. The differences in gold reserves between the two countries can be attributed to their divergent approaches toward reserve management and monetary policies. Russia's focus on increasing gold reserves can be seen as a strategic move to boost its economic resilience and diversify its assets, especially in the face of geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions. On the other hand, Japan's preference for stability and a sizable foreign currency reserve illustrates its conservative approach and emphasis on maintaining the strength of the yen. Overall, Russia has managed to accumulate higher gold reserves compared to Japan. However, it is essential to consider that these gold reserves are just one aspect of both countries' complex financial systems and should be analyzed in conjunction with other economic indicators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their respective financial statuses."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize this article: Your spouse should submit Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative to USCIS. Your spouse will need to submit proof of the marriage, such as a marriage certificate. If you’re already living in the U.S. after entering legally, then you can adjust your status at the same time. Complete and submit Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residency or Adjust Status. Your spouse can submit this form along with Form I-130. If you’re currently living outside the U.S., then you’ll need to wait for your visa to be approved. You’ll attend an interview at the nearest embassy or consulate. Once admitted into the U.S., you can adjust your status by filing Form I-485. The U.S. government is worried about sham marriages, so you can expect to attend an interview where an official will ask personal questions. Common questions include the following: Where did you meet your spouse? How many people attended your wedding? Who does the cooking and who pays the bills? What did you do for your spouse’s birthday? What forms of birth control do you use? You can’t immediately apply for naturalization after receiving your green card. Instead, you must meet the following residency requirements: You must have been a green card holder for the three years immediately before you apply for naturalization. You must have been a continuous resident for the three years before you apply and have been physically present in the U.S. for at least eighteen months. You must have lived in a marriage with your U.S. citizen spouse during the three years. Your spouse must have been a citizen during the entire time. You must have lived within the state or USCIS district for at least three months before you file your application. In addition to residency, you need to show that you have other personal characteristics to be eligible. Check that you satisfy the following: You must be at least eighteen years of age. You must be able to write, read, and speak English. You need to be a person of good moral character. Generally, this means you haven’t broken a serious law and that you meet your legal obligations, such as paying taxes and child support. You must have entered the country legally. For example, you can’t be in the United States illegally and get citizenship simply because you married a citizen. Once you have satisfied the residency requirement, you can submit Form 400, Application for Naturalization. Download and read the instructions before completing the application, available here: https://www.uscis.gov/n-400. When you are ready to file, call 1-800-375-5283 to find out the address. Read the instructions to find out what documents you must submit along with your application. Make payment to “U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” As of June 2017, the filing fee is 640 and the biometric fee is 85. You can pay using money order or check. USCIS will send you a notice telling you where to give your fingerprints and when. USCIS needs your fingerprints so that the FBI can run a background check. You’ll need to meet with immigration officials to go over your application. USCIS is looking to confirm that your application is legitimate and that nothing has changed since you submitted it. You’ll receive a checklist of documents to take with you to the interview, so gather everything ahead of time. You must pass exams in civics and English. You will take them at your interview, and you should prepare as much as possible. For example, look to see if a preparation class is offered near you for either test. You can find the nearest classes at this website: https://my.uscis.gov/findaclass. Enter your zip code. Several practice civics tests are available here: https://my.uscis.gov/prep/test/civics.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

A 22-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly fatally stabbing a mother of two who tripped her boyfriend over in a Las Vegas bar on Tuesday night. Sarah Ann Chavez is accused of killing 30-year-old Misty Elaine Madera following a brawl at Champagne's Cafe on South Maryland Parkway about 11pm. Officers found Madera lying in the back parking lot with stab wounds to her neck as Chavez, covered in blood, was being held back by a bar patron. Madera was rushed to Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center but was pronounced dead shortly after arriving. Witnesses told police the dispute was triggered when Madera tripped Chavez’s. boyfriend inside the bar as he walked to the restroom, Las Vegas Sun reported. Chavez allegedly confronted Madera, from Las Vegas, and they argued briefly. Chavez and her boyfriend were about to leave the bar, before Chavez decided the issue wasn't settled. She again confronted Madera, but this time Madera's sister got involved. The. fight spilled out a back door and into the lot. A bar patron allegedly separated the women, but Chavez punched Madera. Madera reportedly yelled, 'She has a knife', before she was attacked. A bartender called 911 after seeing blood. Misty Madera (pictured) was allegedly sitting near the back of the bar with her sister when she tripped over Chavez's boyfriend, triggering the fight.

Painters, poets, actors, and dancers all thrive here, but our protagonist, Joseph Buquet, is certainly not one of them - at least not yet. A poor migrant worker from the rural provinces, Joseph finds employment as a stagehand at the resplendent Opéra Garnier, enchanted by the prospect of a life embedded in grandeur and art. One evening after a show, while clearing the props, Joseph hears a strange, haunting melody wafting from high in the rafters. Driven by curiosity and fearless naivety, he climbs up into the seemingly endless catacombs that encase the Opéra. He stumbles into an opulent sitting room, where he finds a masked figure playing an organ - the elusive \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". As Joseph confronts him, the Phantom quickly incapacitates him, restrained less by malice than a deep fear of being discovered. In enthralling monologues interspersed with terrified silences from Joseph, the Phantom unveils his backstory - he is Erik, horribly disfigured from birth and rejected by society, who had found refuge and purpose within the opera house. Joseph, a stranger in the grand city himself, feels a surprising connection. Over days of being Erik's captive, he offers to keep Erik's secret if allowed to return to work. Striking an uncertain truce, Erik agrees, releasing Joseph but warning him of severe consequences if he ever breaches their accord. Back amid the stagehands, Joseph's experiences change him, inspiring him to pen a theatrical piece about the Phantom - harboring intentions to assist the misunderstood Erik and transform societal prejudice. His charming script combined with insider secrets from Erik about the opera's design results in a performance that leaves audiences spellbound. However, Madam Carlotta, the opera's lead singer, suspicious of the sudden rise and changing demeanor of a stagehand, starts investigating. Discovering the acquaintance between Joseph and the Phantom, she threatens to unmask Erik's secret, driven by jealousy and a hatred for the unknown. Joseph and Erik now find themselves in a rapidly tightening-corner, wrestling against time to protect both their lives and Erik's secret. The movie culminates in a thrilling climax depicting their desperate efforts to prevent the fall of Erik’s hidden kingdom, ultimately leading to unexpected twists, surrenders, and revelations. \\"The Phantom's Labyrinth\\" explores themes of acceptance, social stigma, dreams, vulnerability, and friendship, providing a poignant narrative that offers more than just a glimpse into the hidden life of a famous phantom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This isn't exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS, though instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion. Plus, an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film (like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou. This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE, though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all. The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the review, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. The review starts with a somewhat negative statement, acknowledging that the film isn't great but admires the writers and director for trying something different. 2. The reviewer mentions the film's main theme and compares it to another film, SLIDING DOORS, implying some positive similarities. 3. The reviewer talks about an odd bald guy, showing some curiosity about the character but not strong emotion. 4. The reviewer points out that the DVD jacket capitalizes on Audrey Tautou's success, indicating that it might be misleading as many actors are involved in the film. 5. Positive points are mentioned, such as the brisk pace, fine acting, and a satisfying conclusion. 6. The reviewer ends with some minor criticisms, such as uninteresting characters and a potentially excessive number of subplots. From the analysis, we can infer that the sentiment of this review is mixed leaning towards positive. The reviewer appreciates certain aspects of the film, such as its unique approach and overall execution, but also acknowledges its shortcomings, such as uninteresting characters and unnecessary subplots."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

(1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;...I think the answer is","completion":"(3). no; The answer is no, and here's a detailed explanation as to why that is the case. The statement \\"Three men are standing outside on the sidewalk conversing.\\" implies that there are three men outside a building, engaging in conversation on a sidewalk. This description provides a clear visual representation of the scenario. Since they are \\"outside\\" on the sidewalk, it is understood that they are not within a building or any indoor setting. On the other hand, the statement \\"The three men are indoors.\\" contradicts the first statement. It suggests that the three men are inside a building or an enclosed space, not outside like the first statement asserts. They cannot be both outside on the sidewalk and indoors simultaneously because these two scenarios are mutually exclusive. Being indoors and being outdoors are two separate and opposing conditions. Given the information presented in both statements, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Three men are standing outside on the sidewalk conversing\\" if \\"The three men are indoors.\\" This is a logical contradiction, and both situations cannot be true at the same time. The two statements are in conflict with each other, and as a result, it would be incorrect to reach the conclusion that the men are outside while also knowing that they are indoors. In short, the answer is \\"no\\" because the information provided in the statements is contradictory, making it impossible to conclude the scenario in which the men are outside conversing on the sidewalk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. Context: The band's influences include Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Pantera, Bad Religion, Dream Theater, Motorhead, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, In Flames, At the Gates, Helloween, Queensryche, System of a Down, AC/DC, NOFX, Alice in Chains, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits, Slayer, The Vandals, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Slipknot, Deftones, Beastie Boys, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Anthrax and AFI. The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in \\"Streets\\", which shows a punk rock style, and \\"Warmness on the Soul\\", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'.\\" On City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from City of Evil, most notably in \\"Dear God\\", which shows a country style and \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. Nightmare contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called \\"Fiction\\", progressive metal-oriented track \\"Save Me\\" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on \\"God Hates Us\\". The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album The Stage, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal. The band has been criticized for \\"not being metal enough\\". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, \\"we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?\\" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Question: Was Dear God considered as heavy as their previous songs ? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"Dear God\\" is not as heavy as their previous songs. It has a country style, which is different from Avenged Sevenfold's usual heavy metal sound. The band likes to experiment with different music genres, and \\"Dear God\\" is an example of that."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This may seem irrelevant, but if you're running in shoes that are too old, too snug, too loose, or which just don't give you the correct support, then you may not be maximizing your potential. Don't be shy. Go to a running store, where a professional can help you find the best fit, and sometimes even watch you run to see what type of shoe would suit you the best. Here are some things to keep in mind when you consider buying new running shoes: How long you've had the old pair. You should replace any pair of running shoes after running between 300–400 miles (480–640 km), which can translate into less than a year of running about 10 miles (16 km) a week, or a lot sooner if you used to them for marathon or half-marathon training. Running in shoes that are no longer in good shape will not only make it harder for you to run fast, but they can lead to injuries. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5c/590103-13b1.jpg/v4-460px-590103-13b1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/5/5c/590103-13b1.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-13b1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Wiggle room. You should have at least a thumb's width of room between the end of your longest toe and the front of your shoe. Most people buy running shoes that are actually too small for them, so it's okay if it feels like you're wearing clown shoes, at first. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b0/590103-13b2.jpg/v4-460px-590103-13b2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/b/b0/590103-13b2.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-13b2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} A secure fit throughout the mid-foot. Your feet should feel pretty snug on either side. A secure fit throughout the heel. Slipping in this area can lead to injuries. You should be eating well enough to give yourself plenty of energy for running, but not so much that you feel sluggish or tired. Don't eat less than an hour before your mile training, or you will feel sluggish and tied down. If you know you'll be doing some intense training on the track or sprinting, eat until you're about 2/3 full. You should eat foods that contain carbohydrates and that are easily digestible, and which will give you energy without weighing you down. Here are some things to keep in mind if you want to eat right to help yourself get faster: It's all about balance. Though the right carbohydrates will give you energy, don't forget that protein or those fruits and veggies. If you're just training to improve your mile time, you do not need to load up on carbohydrates. Don't eat a heavy bowl of pasta before your run, thinking it will give you the energy you need. If you're looking to eat a snack that will help you train, try a banana, a peach, half of a Cliff bar, a piece of wheat toast, or an English muffin with jelly. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/69/590103-14b3.jpg/v4-460px-590103-14b3.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/69/590103-14b3.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-14b3.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Drink at least a 16 oz. glass of water an hour before your run, and make sure you consume at least 8-10 of these glasses throughout the day. In addition to drinking water, drinking a cup of coffee about 30 minutes to an hour before you run can make you go faster. However, don't try this for the first time on race day, or it can make you feel a little bit too jittery and can lead to some digestive issues. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d1/590103-15b1.jpg/v4-460px-590103-15b1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/d/d1/590103-15b1.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-15b1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you're at a healthy weight for your height and frame, then you don't need to try to lose weight at all. However, if you are carrying a little extra weight, it will slow you down because it will weigh your body down as you try to run your mile. Therefore, work on finding a healthy routine for weight loss while continuing to run regularly and eating foods that keep you strong. Running with people who are at your speed, or preferably faster than you, can help you stay motivated and not slack off if you're getting tired. Whether you're on a track team, in a runner's club, or running 5Ks in your town as often as you can, just having the company of others can help you stay strong, think fit, and try to break your own records. And most of all, running with other people can remind you that while fitness is an important goal, so is having fun! Whether you're doing them with your track team or on your own, if you want to improve your speed, you should periodically time yourself when you run the mile, simulating the pressure you'd feel if you were running a real race. You don't have to time yourself every time you do the mile or you will put too much pressure on yourself, but you should do it at least once a week so you put the pressure on, put your body in adrenaline mode, and get ready to succeed. If you beat your PR (personal record), celebrate and think of all the things you do right, so you can continue to kick up your speed in the future. If you're trying to be the start of your high school track team, then yeah, you can aim for running a 6-6:30 mile, or even a 5-5:30 mile. But if you're just trying to run a mile faster because you want to have fun and stay fit, then aiming for that 12 or 10 minute mile is a very impressive goal as well. You don't have to be Usain Bolt to feel good about how quickly you run, and you don't have to keep the pace with all the other runners around you if your body is screaming for you to slow down. It's great to improve your speed, but it's even more important to stay healthy and be proud of yourself for staying fit.","completion":"Improving a mile run time involves proper selection of footwear and adequate nutrition and hydration. Regular footwear checks are encouraged; shoes are to be replaced after running 300–400 miles, taking into consideration factors like proper fit and comfort. Before a mile training, it's advised not to eat less than an hour prior and consume an easily digestible and energizing diet with balanced nutrients. Drinking at least 16 oz. glass of water an hour ahead and maintaining 8-10 glasses throughout the day is also suggested. One may consider coffee too, as it could enhance speed, but should be avoided if it's not part of a regular diet. For improved speed, occasional trials under race-like pressure can be helpful. Also, staying fit and active by running frequently and participating in running groups offer both motivation and fun. Regardless of speed, maintaining a healthy weight and fitness should be prioritized."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Judge Grants Illegal Immigrant Work Privileges In Jail Sentence For Drunken-Driving Incident A Wisconsin sheriff is protesting a recent “slap-on-the wrist” court ruling that allows a man in the country illegally to seek employment as he completes an 11-month jail term from driving drunk in the wrong direction on an interstate. \\"Why would we let an illegal immigrant out on work release to look for a job he's not supposed to have? He's in the country illegally,\\" Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. said, according to a report by The Journal Sentinel. Clarke told his office staff Thursday to inform the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and ask that the man be deported, the paper reported. On July 21, Armando Rodriguez-Benitez, 35, was pulled over by authorities for driving with a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit while headed in the wrong direction on the I-43, the paper reported. An oncoming car was forced to intentionally crash into the median wall to avoid a head-on collision with the intoxicated man's car, according to the report. The paper, citing online court records, reported that a county judge sentenced him to 11 months at a county jail with so-called Huber work release privileges, under a statute that allows some inmates to leave jail to maintain their employment while serving out their sentence. Rick D. Steinberg, Benitez’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com that his client has a \\"high degree\\" of character and education that makes the work release appropriate. \\"This is not your normal criminal,\\" Steinberg said, adding that he has a supportive family and deep roots in the community. \\"Bottom line is that he made a mistake, and he apologized to the court in a better way than I could have.\\" Steinberg didn't dispute that Benitez is in the country illegally, though he declined to discuss Benitez's employment status. Christine Neuman-Ortiz, from Voces de la Frontera, an immigration rights group, told a local radio station that the sheriff is stereotyping immigrants. \\"I think the sheriff should know he's not an immigration judge,\\" she said reported WTMJ. \\"The decision was in regards to driving violations and not related to immigration issues.\\" Benitez pleaded guilty to recklessly endangering safety, a felony, according to court documents. He was fined for drunken driving as a first offense, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. The sheriff, meanwhile, criticized the sentence, considering Benitez had faced up to 10 years in prison and, in Clarke's view, should have been deported immediately. A phone call to the judge's office was not immediately returned. \\"If the judge didn't find this incident serious enough to send him to prison for an extended period of time, then an 11-month bed-and-breakfast stay at the county jail is a waste of taxpayer resources,\\" Clarke said. \\"The deportation process should start today, not 11 months from now.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A Wisconsin sheriff is protesting a court ruling that allows an illegal immigrant to seek employment while serving an 11-month jail term for a drunken-driving incident.

Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in Norwood, Ontario in 1997. Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making Three Days Grace a four-member band. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by My Darkest Days' vocalist Matt Walst, who is also bassist Brad Walst's brother. From March to August 2008, and from January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Los Angeles, again with producer Howard Benson who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that is perceived as more optimistic. This album reflects the maturity of the band members as they overcome problems such as sickness and death within their families in which they stated, \\"We had to be inspired by it, but the outcome is this: It's a new beginning. It's life starting over.\\" According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centres around \\"a new sense of freshness\\" and the idea that \\"you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change\\". Life Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position to date, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mostly positive reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \\"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now \\"...continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a 'hint of sunlight'.\\" He complimented the album, saying it \\"...treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, mid-tempo rockers\\". The first single release from the album, \\"Break\\", was released on September 1, 2009. In support of the album, Three Days Grace embarked on a 20 date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009. They co-headlined a January-February 2010 tour of the U.S. with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf. Life Starts Now was nominated for \\"Best Rock Album\\" at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Billy Talent III. Three Days Grace went on tour with Nickelback and Buckcherry on the \\"Dark Horse Fall 2010 Tour\\".

By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style. Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. This angered the government, and led to his transfer from the capital (1820). He went to the Caucasus and to the Crimea, then to Kamenka and Chisinau, where he became a Freemason.

I am hugely proud and thankful to everyone who pledged, supported the campaign, wrote about it, and helped to spread the word. Some have described us not meeting the goal as a “failure”. I don’t see it that way. Let’s be honest: 32million was always an incredibly ambitious target. We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn’t come cheap (and remember that the 32million didn’t include any costs for software engineering and project management…Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though. I am not surprised that we didn’t hit this ambitious 32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more.

Possible A: floral arrangement, girl's hair, box, car, typewriter Why is \\"floral arrangement\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"The \\"floral arrangement\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, floral arrangements are commonly given as gifts during various occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and other significant milestones. The use of a ribbon in this context serves to add a touch of beauty, elegance, and thoughtfulness to the presentation of the gift. By tying a ribbon around a floral arrangement, the giver effectively elevates the gift's appearance, making it more visually appealing and showing an additional level of care and consideration. Secondly, from a practical standpoint, a ribbon tied around a floral arrangement can help keep the arrangement intact and organized. This can be particularly important when transporting the arrangement, as a loose bunch of flowers is more likely to become damaged or have individual stems fall out of place. The ribbon serves as a functional component that keeps the floral arrangement looking its best. Furthermore, the use of a ribbon also holds symbolic meaning. In many cultures, ribbons represent various notions such as unity, strength, and the binding together of different elements. Incorporating a ribbon into a floral arrangement aligns with these ideas, as it joins the individual flowers together into a cohesive and united display. In addition, customizing the ribbon's color and design can help personalize the gift, allowing the giver to cater to the recipient's unique tastes and preferences. The choice of ribbon can reflect personal sentiments, too – for example, using a specific color to symbolize love, friendship, or sympathy. Lastly, the concept of tying a ribbon around a floral arrangement is steeped in tradition, having been practiced throughout history. Gifting a floral arrangement with a ribbon signifies that the giver respects and follows this time-honored custom, and positions the gift within a broader cultural context. In summary, \\"floral arrangement\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense primarily because tying a ribbon around it enhances both the visual and symbolic aspects of the gift. It conveys thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and an adherence to tradition, making it a popular and fitting way to present a floral arrangement as a gift."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usage: The review mentioned, \\"The food was just okay\\" and \\"it was nothing to write home about\\". These statements indicate that the reviewer found the food to be average at best which contributes to a negative sentiment regarding the food quality. Part #5: Evaluation of beverage quality. Usage: The sentence \\"Coffee (had a cappuccino) was very weak\\" shows the reviewer's disappointment with the coffee quality. It meets the criteria of a negative sentiment related to the beverage quality. Part #6: Mention of possible external factors affecting their experience. Usage: The statement \\"Having said all this, perhaps we were unlucky, went on the wrong day\\" shows the reviewer acknowledging that their experience might have been affected by external factors. This does not change the overall sentiment but shows that the reviewer is aware that their experience might not be representative of the usual service and quality.

Choices: - electric - explosions - waves - collisions A: Answer:","completion":"Collisions Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking why higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in many chemical reactions. We need to identify which interaction between reactant particles is increased due to higher temperatures, causing the rate of reaction to increase as well. Step 2: Analyze the choices - Electric: This refers to interactions between charged particles, which can affect the rate of reaction but is not typically related to temperature changes. - Explosions: These are sudden, violent releases of energy but not the direct cause of increased reaction rates due to higher temperatures. - Waves: While waves can be related to energy propagation, they do not directly explain the increased rate of reaction caused by higher temperatures. - Collisions: This refers to reactant particles physically coming into contact with each other. In a chemical reaction, this is necessary for reactions to occur, and temperature can affect the frequency of these interactions. Step 3: Choose the correct answer Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is \\"collisions.\\" The frequency of collisions between reactant particles increases due to higher temperatures, and since more collisions lead to more opportunities for reactions to occur, the rate of reaction increases as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By 1916, \\"successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousands.\\"General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), an elderly member of the French General Staff, arrives from Paris at the headquarters (a magnificent chateau) of his subordinate, General Paul Mireau (George Macready), to inform him that a major offensive is planned for General Mireau's sector and, in preparation for this offensive, General Broulard wants Mireau's division to capture a well-defended German position nicknamed the 'Anthill'. Mireau balks at the idea, claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the Anthill, much less capture it. Broulard reluctantly mentions that, in a completely unrelated matter, he was thinking that Mireau was due for a promotion, not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the Anthill.

Please answer this question: Who was the original printer of 'Parliamentary Debates', a verbatim record of Parliamentary speeches?","completion":"The original printer of 'Parliamentary Debates,' a verbatim record of Parliamentary speeches, was Thomas Curson Hansard. Born on November 6th, 1776, in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe, Surrey, England, Hansard was a British printer and publisher who became synonymous with the publication of the official transcripts of the proceedings of the British Parliament. Thomas Curson Hansard was the son of Luke Hansard, a respected printer who worked with parliamentary materials. Having printing in his blood, young Thomas pursued a career in this field, facilitating his establishment as the proprietor of his own printing house in 1805. Originally located on Great Turnstile Street, Holborn, London, he later moved the business to John Street, Adelphi's premises in 1811. The very first publication of 'Parliamentary Debates' can be traced back to 1803 when William Cobbett, an English journalist, began recording the speeches verbatim. However, legal concerns and financial troubles plagued Cobbett and forced him to sell the copyright to Hansard in 1810. From that point onwards, Thomas Curson Hansard not only printed the records but also published them, significantly impacting the public sphere. In fact, the term 'Hansard' became synonymous with the publication and is still in use today. This historical document contains comprehensive records of all speeches and discussions taking place during parliamentary sessions. Hansard, being an innovative publisher, understood the importance of accuracy and impartiality, which played a vital role in maintaining the credibility of this publication. Hansard continued the task of editing and publishing 'Parliamentary Debates' until his retirement in 1829, leaving a legacy that continues to resonate with both- historians and political activists. His son, also named Thomas, took over the business after his retirement and was responsible for successfully transferring its management to Thomas Curson Hansard Jr., who was in control from 1860 to 1874. Subsequently, it was handed over to the Hansard Publishing Union. Eventually, in 1909, the printing and publishing of parliamentary debates were taken over by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (now The Stationery Office or TSO), and the publication became an official part of government functions. Thomas Curson Hansard's dedication to creating an accurate, transparent, and unbiased record of parliamentary speeches allowed politicians, members of the public, and academics alike to closely follow the proceedings of the British Parliament. Today, 'Hansard' remains a crucial resource for understanding the political evolution and legislative processes in the United Kingdom, as well as in several countries that have adapted the Hansard system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: China has announced it's abolishing its one-child policy. What difference has it made, statistically speaking? 400 million births prevented The one-child policy, officially in place since 1979, has prevented 400 million births. Parents have faced fines and other punishments for having more children. The majority of the decrease in China's fertility rate happened in the 1970s. It dropped from 5.8 children per woman in 1970 to 2.7 in 1978. Despite the one-child policy the rate had only fallen to 1.7 by 2013. 21:28-baby deaths rate Since the one-child policy was introduced, baby girls have become more likely to die than boys. In the 1970s, according to the United Nations, 60 males per 1, 000 live births died under the age of one. For girls the figure was 53. In the 1980s, after the one-child policy became official, the rate for both was 36. By the 1990s, 26 males per 1,000 live births died before the age of one - and 33 girls. The 2000s saw 21 boys per 1,000 live births dying and 28 girls. 1.16 boys born for every girl Sexually selective abortions have been considered as a major cause of China's unusual imbalance. Gietel-Basten, associate professor in social policy at Oxford University, says the births of many girls are not registered if parents have broken the rule by having two children, adding officials often turn a blind eye. It's estimated there are now 33 million more men than women in China. 4: 2: 1 families With the ageing of China's population and the continuation of the one-child policy, a \\"4: 2 :1\\" home is the description given to households in which there are four grandparent, cared for by two working age parents, who themselves have one child.

Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque. What did this lead him too","completion":"It appears there might be some confusion in your question, as it refers to \\"him\\" whereas the preceding information is about Hattie McDaniel, who was a woman. However, assuming you're asking about the implications of Hattie McDaniel's Oscar disappearance, it has led to many speculations, investigations, and continued interest in her life and career. The disappearance of McDaniel's Oscar has created intrigue and opened up many debates about its fate. W.B. Carter's extensive investigation has provided various probable scenarios for its disappearance, debunking prior claims that it was stolen or discarded during civil rights protests. The mystery surrounding the award has kept the narrative of McDaniel's pioneering achievement alive, encouraging continuous discourse around the issues of racial progression, representation, and equality in the entertainment industry. Moreover, the case of the missing Oscar has stimulated interest in McDaniel's life, achievements, and struggles as an African American actress during racially segregated times in Hollywood. This has, in many ways, preserved her legacy and continually highlights her significant role in the industry. She has become a symbol of endurance and perseverance in the face of racial prejudice. The mystery of McDaniel's Oscar has also led to repeated acknowledgments of her contribution, as demonstrated by actress Mo'Nique during her Oscar acceptance speech in 2010. By channeling McDaniel and mentioning her name, Mo'Nique brought renewed attention to McDaniel's historical significance, casting a spotlight on the lingering issues of racial discrimination and the importance of diversity in Hollywood. In summary, the ongoing search for Hattie McDaniel's Oscar has resulted in continued interest in her life, work, and the larger subject of racial bias in the entertainment industry.

Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Context: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

Process: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose miners extract more happens, how will it affect less coal is removed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Step-by-step justification: Step 1: The mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - If miners extract more coal, the mine may need to be larger or deeper to accommodate the increased extraction rate. This could result in increased resource requirements for excavating the mine and potential geological or environmental impacts. Step 2: Miners enter the mine - With more coal extraction happening, there might be a need for more miners to enter the mine to keep up with the extraction demand. This could lead to potential safety risks, capacity constraints, and increased labor costs. Step 3: Miners remove the coal from the mine - If more coal is removed, it might deplete the coal resources faster than expected, leading to a shorter mine life. Additionally, there could be an increase in worker fatigue due to the increased workload, leading to a higher chance of accidents or health issues for the miners. Step 4: The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - As more coal is extracted, there could be a need for an expanded transport infrastructure (larger carts, more conveyor belts) within the mine to handle the increased volume of coal. Step 5: The coal is moved up to the surface - With increased coal extraction, more equipment or personnel may be needed to move the coal to the surface, resulting in increased operational costs and potential additional safety risks. Step 6: The coal is loaded onto a truck - As more coal is produced, there may be a need for more trucks or more frequent trips to transport the coal, which could lead to increased transportation costs and a higher likelihood of accidents. Step 7: The truck takes the coal to a power station - With more coal being transported, the power station may need to adjust its processes to handle the increased supply of coal, such as expanding storage capacity or modifying their procedures for handling incoming deliveries. In conclusion, the perturbation of extracting more coal can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process, potentially impacting mine excavation, worker safety, resource depletion, transportation infrastructure, and power station operations. It is essential to carefully consider these factors when adjusting coal extraction rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

To do that, let's add 47730 to both sides of the equation: -645 * b = 47730 Finally, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by -645 to find the value of 'b': b = 47730 / -645 When we do the calculation, we get: b = -74 And there you have it!

It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace .

The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours . - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August--Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznan) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery. From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become \\"what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.\\" His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by \\"promoting\\" Hoffmann to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079-1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Torun). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married \\"Mischa\\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802. Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue's periodical, Die Freimuthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis (\\"The Prize\\"), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d'or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in Konigsberg. At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to Konigsberg. Why caused that?","completion":"Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann, also known as E.T.A. Hoffmann, got into some trouble when he drew funny pictures, called caricatures, of military officers at a party. People knew he made the drawings and complained to the important people in Berlin. Even though they didn't want to punish him because he was good at his job, they decided to \\"promote\\" him by moving him to a new place called Plock in New East Prussia. This made Hoffmann very sad because he felt like he was sent far away from everyone and everything he knew."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He is best known as lead guitarist and violinist of the rock band Luna Sea. After Luna Sea went on break in 1997, Sugizo started his own solo career and opened the independent label \\"Cross\\" to produce other artists, as well as releasing his own records. He points out that the opening of his record label was one of his very important projects at the time, but not anymore. On July 9, his debut single \\"Lucifer\\" was released and reached number 8 on the Oricon singles chart. It was followed by his first solo tour \\"Abstract Day\\" which lasted until the final performance in August at Akasaka Blitz, where he was joined by DJ Krush, Masami Tsuchiya and members of Japan. Then on September 10 he released his second single, \\"A Prayer\\", which reached number 7 on the charts. On November 19, his first solo album Truth? was released, and reached number 12 on the album charts. It was met with mixed reviews, largely because of the unexpected musical style which mixed different genres with electronica beats. A variety of artists participated in the album, from Ryuichi Sakamoto and Mick Karn, to Lou Rhodes and Valerie Etienne. Towards the end of the year, remix editions of his two maxi singles and album were released. As Luna Sea resumed activities, until the bands disbandement, Sugizo collaborated in the studio with actress Miki Nakatani, and singers Miu Sakamoto and Vivian Hsu among others. On August 11, 1999 a compilation album titled \\"Grand Cross 1999\\", which was sponsored by Sugizo's record label \\"Cross\\", was released, featuring many musicians with whom he had worked with before and many for the first time. In 2001, he participated in Ryuichi Sakamoto's N.M.L. (\\"No More Landmines\\"), a campaign to promote awareness of the problems of land mines and promote a ban on them, and helped in the making of the album Zero Landmine. He starred in Ken Nikai's movie Soundtrack and composed the music for the film. On November 14, a compilation album inspired by the film, titled Parallel Side of Soundtrack was released, and the following year he released the single \\"Rest in Peace & Fly Away\\" featuring Bice on vocals.

The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement \\"next stop Canterbury\\" and thinking he was in Canterbury. As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform who pours glue on her hair, before escaping. It transpires that this has happened quite a few times before, to other women. Alison asks Bob if he could spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several young boys who play large-scale war games. The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man's victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks.

The author is expressing their dissatisfaction with how the character Sarah's actions are portrayed in the movie and questions the overall message conveyed by the storyline. Firstly, the use of the term \\"psychotic\\" to describe Sarah's dedication showcases a sense of disapproval, as it contrasts with the idealized notion of romance that is often expected in movies. A psychotic character is typically mentally unstable and exhibits irrational behaviors that may not be relatable or plausible. Consequently, the author is highlighting a significant flaw in Sarah's characterization by asserting that her dedication to finding her husband may not be relatable or even appealing to the audience. Secondly, the author’s mention of the lack of \\"a convincing case\\" demonstrates an overall negative reaction to the movie's narrative. By suggesting that the storyline does not effectively persuade the audience to comprehend or empathize with Sarah's emotional journey, the author is emphasizing the movie's failure in achieving its desired impact. Furthermore, the author raises a question about the thematic priorities of the movie. By stating that \\"one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness,\\" the author implies that Sarah's personal pain seems to be given undue importance compared to the losses portrayed throughout the movie. This assertion contributes to the perception of the sentiment as critical and disenchanted, since it raises concerns about the movie's moral message and the balance between personal emotions and broader events. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative, critical, and disapproving. The author showcases their dissatisfaction with the character's portrayal, the movie's narrative, and its moral priorities. This sentiment analysis offers valuable insights into the potential shortcomings of the movie, as seen from the author's perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I admit , I welled up a few times during the fireworks and on that train ride . Both for memories I have from my trip with my dad ( recently passed ) and memories we were making with our girls on this trip . A very , very special place Disneyland is . Why would I well up during the fireworks and train ride ?","completion":"Based on the context provided, you would well up during the fireworks and train ride at Disneyland for a combination of emotional reasons, primarily rooted in nostalgia and the creation of new memories with loved ones. These emotional responses are influenced by the following factors: 1. Connection to past memories with your father: Given that your father has recently passed away, the experiences at Disneyland might evoke strong memories of the time you spent with him in the same environment. Theme parks, like Disneyland, are filled with shared experiences, laughter, and fun for families and friends. It is natural for you to associate these events with the unforgettable moments you had with your father. As a result, the fireworks and train ride could trigger emotional reactions—such as welling up—due to the bittersweet remembrance of the joyful times you had with your dad. 2. Creation of new memories with your daughters: Experiencing Disneyland with your daughters signifies the passing on of cherished traditions and the creation of new memories as a family. Seeing your children delight in the magic of Disneyland can evoke strong emotions, especially when it reminds you of your own childhood experiences with your father. The fireworks and train ride, being symbolic representations of these special memories, might cause you to well up as you recognize the significance of sharing similar experiences with your own children. 3. Disneyland as a symbol of happiness and family bonding: Disneyland is well-known for being a place that brings people together and encourages family bonding and togetherness. The atmosphere of the park, the enchanting attractions, and the shared experiences serve as poignant reminders of the importance of maintaining strong connections with our loved ones. As you take part in the spectacle of the fireworks and the train ride, you might be overcome with emotion as Disneyland has a unique ability to amplify feelings of happiness, love, and appreciation for the special moments we spend with our family and friends. 4. Emotional impact of the fireworks and train ride: Both the fireworks display and train ride may hold emotional significance in and of themselves. Fireworks are a symbol of celebration, wonder, and awe, while the train ride may represent a journey and the passing of time. Witnessing these events might evoke deep emotional reactions due to their inherent beauty and the feelings they evoke. This, combined with the emotional connections to your father and the new memories being created with your daughters, would likely make these experiences particularly poignant and lead you to well up during these special moments. In conclusion, the feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions during the fireworks and the train ride at Disneyland is likely a result of the connection between your past memories with your father, the ongoing formation of new memories with your daughters, and the powerful impact of the theme park's atmosphere and attractions. The amalgamation of these factors creates an emotional experience that can indeed make Disneyland a very special place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Partway across the Atlantic , \\" He just heard two huge bangs and the balloon shuddered and fell , \\" the balloonist 's spokesperson Nicky Webster said . OPTIONS: -- no; -- yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"yes. Both sentences convey the same information, but they are structured differently. In both instances, Nicky Webster, the spokesperson for Hempleman-Adams, is explaining that the balloonist experienced two huge bangs as well as the balloon shuddering and falling. The difference between the two sentences lies in their organization and the placement of information. In the first sentence, the quote is provided first, followed by the identification of Nicky Webster as the speaker and the mention of Hempleman-Adams: \\"He just heard two huge bangs and the balloon shuddered and fell,\\" Nicky Webster, a spokesman for Hempleman-Adams, said. In the second sentence, the situation (\\"Partway across the Atlantic\\") is introduced at the beginning, and the quote is embedded within the information about the speaker and the balloonist: Partway across the Atlantic, \\"He just heard two huge bangs and the balloon shuddered and fell,\\" the balloonist's spokesperson Nicky Webster said. Despite these differences in structure, both sentences convey the same overall meaning, and thus the answer is yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However , there were so many mechanical mistakes in the thesis itself even after two other people had looked at it that they gave me 12 months to correct it in . This is rather a hard wake - up call as to whether I really want to continue in scholarship . At this point in time , I am very seriously considering a career change back to the IT industry whence I came . Question What may I be trying to get my degree in ? Possible answers: Options: (I). Computer science (II). None of the above choices . (III). Physics (IV). Biology The answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it appears that you may be trying to get your degree in Computer Science (Option I). There are a few reasons that support this conclusion: 1. You mentioned making a career change back to the IT industry, which is where you originally worked. This indicates that your background and prior experience are in the IT field, which is usually closely related to computer science. 2. Your experience in the IT industry would have likely prepared you for advanced study in the field of computer science. To pursue a PhD, one generally needs a deep understanding and passion for the chosen subject. The fact that you successfully passed your defense further supports the notion that your area of expertise lies within computer science. 3. The other options listed (Physics and Biology) do not seem to be closely connected with the IT industry, nor is there any information in the provided context that connects you to either of these fields. While it is not explicitly mentioned, the context strongly suggests that your degree is most likely in Computer Science. This, however, does not eliminate the possibility of other related fields like computer engineering or information technology, which could also have strong ties to the IT industry. Nevertheless, based on the given options, Computer Science (Option I) seems to be the most reasonable assumption."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},E={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
