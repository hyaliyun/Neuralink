A woman who woke from a coma to learn she was four months pregnant has told of her joy after giving birth to a 'perfect' baby boy. Doctors discovered car crash victim Gemma Holmes, 26, was four weeks pregnant when she was rushed to hospital after colliding with a parked car while driving a scooter last September. Ms Holmes - who has been confined to a wheelchair since the accident because her pregnancy prevented her from undergoing vital surgery - was given the shock news when she awoke from a coma around three months later. 'My little miracle': Car crash victim Gemma Holmes was confined to a wheelchair after doctors discovered she was pregnant - preventing them from operating on her injuries. Five months on, Ms Holmes, from Dilton Marsh, Wiltshire, has given birth to baby son Ruben. 'I couldn’t stop crying when they first. showed him to me, because he is my little miracle baby,' she said. 'I was just so. happy to see him after everything we’ve been through.' Not only did Ms Holmes have no idea she was expecting when she awoke from the coma, the amnesia she suffered as a result of the crash meant the three years leading up to it were wiped from her memory - including any recollection of baby Ruben's father Luke Dicks. To add to her ordeal, the new mother has been in a wheelchair since the accident because doctors refrained from performing vital surgery to her back upon learning she was pregnant. But now Ruben has arrived doctors have told the 26-year-old she will learn to walk again, with her operation set to take place in six months time. Baby steps: The brave 26-year-old, seen cuddling baby Ruben, will be able to learn to walk again following her surgery in six months time. 'The doctors have said they will operate on my back after Ruben is six months old, because I’m breast feeding and they want to give me time to bond,' Ms Holmes said.'The doctors will have to break my back again and put metal plates in. I will then have up to two more years in the wheelchair before they think I may be able to walk and run with my baby.' Ms Holmes suffered severe head and neck injuries in the horror smash in September last year and was airlifted to hospital in a coma. She initially woke in October before being placed back into an induced coma until December. Ruben. was born on Thursday at the Royal United Hospital in Bath and is being. looked after by his mother and his grandmother, Julie Brown.Ms. Holmes, who split from Mr Dicks, 31, two weeks before her accident,. said: 'The nurses at the hospital were all absolutely brilliant, which. helped put me at ease.'My. mum has been amazing and helps me out a lot, but I can feed him and I. also changed his nappy for the first time the other day.' Horror smash: Gemma, seen with her mother Julie Brown and baby Ruben, awoke from a coma to learn she was four months pregnant. Her mother added: 'Gemma is so happy and so excited about the baby. It’s amazing he is here after everything that has happened. 'We had some scares during the pregnancy but he is beautiful.' While Ms Holmes says she won't be getting back together with Ruben's father, Mr Dicks has been visiting both mother and baby. 'When I woke up and I was told I was pregnant I remember thinking, “What? how did that happen?” she said'I have been told recently that I said some time before the crash I didn’t want kids before I was 30.'I was just in shock. Ruben’s dad was not around while I was in hospital but now he has said he wants to see him everyday,' she said. 'It is just great for my son. There is no chance we will get back together but I am glad he will be part of Ruben’s life.'Ruben is just gorgeous, he is perfect. He is so good we have to wake him up for feeds.'Ms Holmes' mother Julie, a grandmother-of-six said: 'I was told Gemma was pregnant a week after the accident. It is all a blur that time.'I didn’t tell anyone for a month because they didn’t think she would make it through.'It was such a shock for her when the hospital staff told her she was pregnant – she had lost three years of memory. It has just been very emotional.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Gemma Holmes, a 26-year-old car crash victim, woke from a coma to find out she was four months pregnant.

What is the best way to: comb","completion":"The best way to comb properly involves considering several factors such as hair type, comb selection, hair condition, and the combing technique. Here's a detailed guide on how to comb effectively: 1. Identify your hair type: First, it's essential to know your hair type (straight, wavy, curly, or tightly curled) as it helps you choose the right comb and technique. 2. Choose the right comb: Selecting a proper comb is crucial for effective combing. Here are different types of combs and their best uses: - Wide-toothed combs: These are suitable for detangling wet hair or for people with curly or wavy hair. - Fine-toothed combs: These work best for straight hair and help with styling or backcombing. - Rattail combs: These combs have a pointed end, ideal for creating clean partings and styling. - Paddle brush combs: These are perfect for removing knots and tangles from thicker hair types, as well as daily brushing. Make sure your comb is clean and free of hair, oil, or product residue. 3. Prepare your hair: Before combing, ensure that your hair is clean, damp (after shower) or at least slightly damp, and free of tangles. You can use a leave-in conditioner or detangling spray to help remove tangles without damaging your hair. 4. Section your hair: Divide your hair into manageable sections (use hair clips if needed). This makes it easier to comb and reduces the risk of breakage and painful tugging. 5. Start from the tips and work your way up: Always start combing at the tips of your hair and work your way up to the roots. This helps to remove any tangles without causing further knots or damage. 6. Use gentle strokes: Apply gentle and slow strokes when combing your hair to minimize breakage. If you encounter a knot or tangle, try using your fingers to detangle before continuing combing. 7. Care for your hair type: - For straight or wavy hair: Comb gently in a downward motion. It helps in maintaining the natural texture of your hair. - For curly hair: Limit combing when your hair is dry, as it could lead to frizz and breakage. It's better to use a wide-toothed comb to detangle when your hair is damp or wet. - For tightly curled hair: Avoid combing dry hair, as it can cause severe breakage. Instead, apply a leave-in conditioner and use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to remove tangles when your hair is wet. 8. Pay attention to your roots and scalp: While combing, use soft and regular strokes and pay attention to your roots. Gently massaging your scalp helps with blood circulation, promoting hair growth and healthy hair. 9. Finish with a styling product: For added nourishment or to secure your desired style, you can apply a hair serum, oil, or styling product after combing. 10. Clean your comb regularly: Cleaning your comb periodically with soapy water and a toothbrush helps in removing any residue, hair strands, and dirt that could damage your hair. By following these steps, you'll be able to comb your hair effectively, prevent hair damage, and maintain healthy hair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Answer the question below: If someone has a smaller than average physical heart then it will beat more or less in order to pump blood? Assuming that: When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, the heart has to beat less often in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow. The answer is:","completion":"If someone has a smaller than average physical heart, it will generally need to beat more frequently to maintain the same volume of blood flow as someone with an average-sized heart. There are few factors we need to consider in this situation. 1. Stroke volume: The stroke volume is the amount of blood that the heart pumps in a single contraction. A smaller heart will have a lower stroke volume, meaning it will expel less blood with each contraction compared to an average-sized heart. To compensate for this lower stroke volume and maintain the same level of blood flow, the smaller heart will need to beat more often. 2. Cardiac output: Cardiac output is the volume of blood the heart pumps within one minute, which is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate (number of beats per minute). A smaller heart with lower stroke volume would need to increase its heart rate to achieve the same cardiac output as someone with a larger heart. 3. Oxygen and nutrient delivery: The primary function of the circulatory system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues and organs and return deoxygenated blood and waste back to the heart. To achieve this, a smaller heart will need to contract more often to ensure that enough blood is circulating through the body, carrying sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. 4. Physical demands: The heart's rate and strength of contraction adjust to the body's changing needs, such as during physical activities or periods of stress. If a person with a smaller heart engages in physical activity or experiences stress, their heart will need to beat at a higher rate compared to someone with an average-sized heart to maintain the same level of performance and meet the body's demands. 5. Adaptability: It is crucial to note that the human body can adapt to various situations, and the heart is no exception. If a person has a smaller heart, the heart and circulatory system may adapt by improving the efficiency of its contractions, increasing stroke volume, or creating a more efficient distribution of blood. Such adaptations may help to reduce the need for a consistently higher heart rate. In conclusion, a person with a smaller than average physical heart will generally need to have a higher heart rate to pump the same amount of blood as someone with an average-sized heart, considering the lower stroke volume, cardiac output, oxygen and nutrient delivery, and additional physical demands. However, the body's adaptability could also allow for improvements in efficiency and distribution that could potentially reduce the need for a consistently higher heart rate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The estimated jackpot for Wednesday night's Powerball lottery game has climbed to 700 million, making it the second-largest in U.S. history. Some details about the game and how the prize has grown so large: ___ WHEN IS THE DRAWING AND HOW DOES THE GAME WORK? The drawing will be Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. Eastern Time in Tallahassee, Florida. Five white balls will be drawn from a drum containing 69 balls and one red ball will be selected from a drum with 26 balls. To win, players need to have paid 2 for a ticket and either have chosen numbers or opted to let a computer make a random choice. ___ THE PRIZE The jackpot is listed as 700 million, but that refers to the annuity option, doled out in 30 payments over 29 years. Nearly all winners favor the cash option, which pays significantly less. For the current jackpot, the cash prize would be 443.3 million. ___ THE ODDS The odds of winning are one in 292.2 million. Tom Rietz, a professor at the University of Iowa who researches probabilities, says one way to think about it is to envision the 324 million U.S. residents. Your chance of winning is roughly comparable to being that one lucky person out of the entire population, with everyone else losing. ___ TAXES Federal income taxes will take a 25 percent bite from winnings. State taxes vary, so the amount winners will pay in taxes depend on where they play. Some of the nation's biggest states, including California and Texas, don't assess state taxes on lottery prizes, so winners in those spots would be just a bit richer. ___ WHAT IF I MATCH SOME BUT NOT ALL THE NUMBERS? Face it, you're almost certainly not going to win the jackpot, but players have much better odds of one in 25 of winning a lesser prize. Those odds range from one in 11.7 million of winning 1 million for matching the five regular balls to one in 38 for matching the Powerball and winning 4. ___ WHAT'S THE POINT OF POWERBALL? Amid all the talk about sudden wealth, it's easy to forget that the purpose of Powerball is to raise money for government programs in the 44 states where the game is played, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each jurisdiction decides how to spend the money raised by Powerball and other lottery games, with some funding college scholarships, others spending the money on transportation and many using it for general state programs. ___ Follow Scott McFetridge on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/smcfetridge ||||| An estimated jackpot of 700 million is up for grabs in the Powerball lottery draw on Wednesday night — potentially the second-largest lottery payout in the nation.

What is the final step of the following process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation","completion":"The final step in the process of acid rain is the negative impact on aquatic ecosystems, soil, and wildlife. After acid rain has destroyed vegetation and scoured rocks, the acids can leach into soil and water sources, leading to further damage and consequences. 1. Aquatic ecosystems: When acid rain flows into streams, rivers, and lakes, it can lower their pH levels, making them more acidic. This change in water chemistry can make it difficult for certain aquatic species to survive, especially those with a low tolerance for acidity, such as fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. The decline in these populations can disrupt the balance of the aquatic ecosystem, affecting the whole food chain and leading to the loss of biodiversity. 2. Soil: Acid rain can deplete the soil of important nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, which are essential for plant growth. As a result, the soil becomes less fertile, affecting crop production and forest health. In addition, acid rain can release toxic metals, such as aluminum, which can bind to the soil, further inhibiting plant growth. 3. Wildlife: The decline in vegetation and disruptions to aquatic ecosystems can lead to a decline in available food and habitat for various wildlife species. In turn, this can result in shifts in wildlife populations, sometimes leading to the decline or disappearance of certain species in affected areas. In conclusion, the final step of the acid rain process involves the disruption of aquatic ecosystems, soil health, and the impact on wildlife populations, ultimately affecting the environment and its inhabitants in various ways and leading to long-term harm to ecosystems and biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions.

Answer the following question: Article: The Red Sea is parting again, but this time no one can help. Satellite pictures show that the Arabian plate and the African plate are moving away from each other, stretching the Earth's crust and widening the southern end of the Red Sea. Last September, series of earthquakes started splitting the planet's surface in Ethiopia. Over a period of three weeks, the sides on the rift separated by 26 feet. \\"We think that the crust is melted slowly at depths greater than 10 kilometers, where it is hotter, forming molten rock,\\" said Tim J Wright. \\"This molten rock rises through the crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock.\\" The molten rock collects at depths of 3 to 5 kilometers. Wright explained, \\"Slowly, the pressure has been building up until last September when it finally cracked, breaking the crust.\\" The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts. For the past 30 million years Africa and Arabia have been going through the continental rifting process, the same one that made the Red Sea part again. \\"The ground is continually moving---much more rapidly now than before,\\" Wright said. \\"On average, the two sides move apart at about 2 centimeters per year.\\" This latest split, added to the long-term rifting process could eventually create a huge new sea. Although such processes could take millions of years to occur, this event has given scientists an opportunity to examine the break in real time. Question: The passage is mainly about _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the cause why the Red Sea is parting again\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"the cause why the Red Sea is parting again\\" is accurate.

Context: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

Movie title: The Day the Earth Stopped Context: The film centers on Josh Myron (C. Thomas Howell) dealing with an alien invasion as 666 gigantic 400-foot tall interplanetary robots land on Earth.As the robots are landing, two humanoid aliens arrive, one male and one female (Sinead McCafferty). Both are fully naked and are eventually captured by the military who tries to communicate with them. Eventually, the female starts talking to Myron and reveals that she can read his mind along with others. Myron is told that the entire human race is a threat to the rest of the galaxy and unless she is shown the value of humanity by sunset, the planet will be destroyed.Attempts to communicate with the robots fail as they vaporize anyone that tries to attack them or even fires a rifle to get their attention. An effort is made to destroy the robots using Sidewinder Missiles, delivered by F-22s. The missiles are ineffective and the attacking planes are destroyed by laser attack.The woman, who reveals that her name in its closest English translation is 'Skye', also displays the ability to harness surrounding energy to protect herself.

Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \\"the library lady\\" or just \\"the helper\\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. Which of the following statements is true? A) Every child in hospital receives some teaching. B) Not enough is known about hospital teaching. C) Hospital teaching is of poor quality. D) The special children's hospitals are worst off.

Answer the following question: Process: - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You have more heart damage happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis stated suggests that the presence of heart damage may result in a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. In this case, it's crucial to consider the effects of heart damage on the oxygenation process and the overall consequences on the body. When heart damage occurs, it can lead to a reduced ability of the heart to pump blood effectively, which consequently affects the transportation of oxygen to different parts of the body. This may be due to weakened or damaged heart muscles, irregular heart rhythms, or valve disorders that can compromise the heart's ability to function properly. The direct impact of heart damage on the oxygenation process is the reduced efficiency of oxygen transport within the bloodstream. The sequence of events in the oxygenation process, starting from inhalation, remain unaffected by heart damage until the point where the oxygenated blood is supposed to be pumped by the heart. The oxygen molecules would still be absorbed by the hemoglobin within the red blood cells and be transported within the capillaries, but the circulation process might be hindered by the weakened heart function. Considering the hypothetical perturbation of reduced oxygen delivery due to heart damage, the system will experience both direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly, the heart's impaired pumping action will lead to decreased blood circulation, causing a reduced amount of oxygen reaching various bodily tissues and organs. The body will attempt to compensate for this reduced delivery of oxygen by increasing the heart rate and utilizing other reserve mechanisms to maintain adequate oxygen levels. However, this adaptation process may eventually lead to chronic issues like fatigue, shortness of breath, or even heart failure if the underlying cause of heart damage is not addressed. Indirectly, heart damage leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream may affect other aspects of the body as well, such as the following: 1. Cellular respiration: Reduced oxygen levels in the bloodstream will limit the amount of oxygen available for cellular respiration, a process through which cells produce the energy they need to function. This can result in a decrease in overall energy levels and impaired metabolic processes. 2. Brain function: The brain is one of the most vital organs in the body and relies heavily on a continuous supply of oxygen. A decrease in oxygen supply may lead to various neurological symptoms and impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion, dizziness, or even loss of consciousness. 3. Muscular performance: Decreased oxygen availability will affect muscle function, leading to fatigue, weakness, and poor physical endurance. This can impede daily activities and overall quality of life. 4. Immune system: Reduced blood circulation and oxygen availability may weaken the immune system, making it more difficult to fight off infections and heal from injuries. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that heart damage could lead to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream can have both direct and indirect effects on the oxygenation process and overall body function. It is essential to address the underlying cause of heart damage and work towards improving heart function to ensure adequate oxygen supply is maintained and prevent further health complications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The equation is: 102 * m - 441 * m + 21533 = -16096 Since both terms involve the variable m, we can combine them: (102 - 441) * m + 21533 = -16096 This simplifies to: -339 * m + 21533 = -16096 Now, we want to isolate the variable m on one side of the equation. To do this, let's subtract 21533 from both sides: -339 * m = -37629 Next, we can solve for m by dividing both sides of the equation by -339: m = -37629 / -339 Calculating this, we get: m ≈ 111 So, the solution to the equation 102 * m - 441 * m + 21533 = -16096 is m ≈ 111."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may have several different interest rates that you want to compare. Divide the number by 100 and then divide this interest rate by 365, the number of days in a year. This will give you the interest rate to use in the formula. An annual percentage rate of .5 percent or .005, when divided by 365, is equal to .00137 percent, or .0000137. If the principle is 10,000, when multiplied by .0000137, it is equal to .1370. Rounded up, this account will earn approximately .14 per day, based on these examples. Multiply the principal, 10,000, by the annual percentage rate of .5 percent or .005 to calculate interest manually. The answer is 50.00. Multiply the daily interest amount of .1370 by 365 days; the answer is also 50.00.","completion":"To summarize, the process of calculating interest involves considering factors such as the principal amount (the money you invest or save), the term length, and the proposed interest rates. When comparing different interest rates, divide the rate by 100 and then by 365, representing the number of days in a year. This will provide the daily interest rate to use in the formula. For example, with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 0.5% (which is equal to 0.005), dividing by 365 yields a daily interest rate of 0.0000137. By using a principal amount of 10,000, multiplying it by the daily interest rate (0.0000137) results in a daily interest of about 0.14. To calculate the annual interest manually, you can multiply the principal (10,000) by the APR (0.005), which equals 50.

Please answer the following question: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. Which reservoir would most likely not casue damaged dock, reservoir A or reservoir B? Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Reservoir A would most likely not cause damage to docks. This is because the engineer hired for Reservoir A properly managed the water level by letting water out in the fall, following the usual protocols to prevent ice from damaging docks and other structures around the lake.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person observed a loss in genetic diversity? A:","completion":"Bobby Step-by-step justification: 1. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals, which indicates a limited population size. Will, on the other hand, studied a large, healthy population of the same species. 2. In smaller populations, there is a higher chance of inbreeding, leading to a higher probability of certain genetic traits becoming more prominent or fixed in the population. 3. Inbreeding reduces genetic variation within a population, and low genetic diversity may lead to a lower adaptation potential to environmental changes and an increased risk of genetic disorders. 4. Therefore, based on the limited population size Bobby studied, it is more likely that he observed a loss in genetic diversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Taking her clothes to the dry cleaners was more important for Sarah than Maria because Choose from: (I). Sarah had a professional job in an office.; (II). Maria had a professional job in an office.;","completion":"Taking her clothes to the dry cleaners was more important for Sarah than Maria because Sarah had a professional job in an office. In this context, it is important to emphasize that different professions and work environments often require varying levels of dress code and presentation. This difference is critical when comparing Sarah and Maria's reasons for needing dry cleaning services. Given that Sarah had a professional job in an office, there are several underlying factors that may contribute to this need for maintaining clean and crisp clothing: 1. Office Dress Code: Office environments generally have a stricter dress code compared to other workplaces. Employees in professional office settings are usually required to dress in business attire, which typically consists of formal clothing such as suits, dress shirts, blouses, and tailored pants or skirts. In order to maintain a polished and professional appearance, it is essential for Sarah to regularly bring her clothes to the dry cleaner. 2. First Impressions: In a professional setting, first impressions are crucial for establishing credibility and trust. Wearing clean, well-ironed, and fitted clothing communicates that Sarah takes her job seriously and respects her work environment. This not only reflects positively on her personal brand but also enhances her professional relationships with both clients and colleagues. 3. Client Meetings: If Sarah's job involves meeting with clients, it's important for her to project a professional image that instills confidence in her expertise. This extends to her clothing choices and overall appearance, making regular visits to the dry cleaner essential in maintaining her high standards. 4. Company Culture: Office environments frequently emphasize and reinforce the importance of professionalism in all aspects of the job. Sarah's need to abide by company culture and expectations further emphasizes the necessity of maintaining impeccably clean and pressed clothing. 5. Networking Events: As part of her professional role, Sarah may also attend networking events or business conferences, where she represents her company and herself. Wearing fresh and presentable clothes can not only boost her confidence but also can help her establish new connections in the business world. On the other hand, while we do not know the specifics of Maria's job, the fact that it is not specified as an office professional implies that her work environment may have more relaxed dress code requirements, or her professional role may not place as much emphasis on appearances. This contrast between their respective professions results in the greater importance of using dry cleaning services for Sarah compared to Maria. In conclusion, taking her clothes to the dry cleaners was more important for Sarah than Maria because Sarah had a professional job in an office that necessitated a strict adherence to a polished and proper appearance. This attention to detail manifested in many professional aspects, such as abiding by the office dress code, establishing positive first impressions, attending client meetings, conforming to company culture, and participating in networking events—all of which ultimately contributed to Sarah's overall success and growth in her professional career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which European country's national flag is a horizontal tricolour: Blue, Black and White?","completion":"The European country whose national flag consists of a horizontal tricolour of blue, black, and white is Estonia. Estonia is located in the northeastern region of Europe, positioned along the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The country shares borders with Latvia to the south and Russia to the east, while it lies across the Gulf of Finland from its northern neighbor, Finland, and the Baltic Sea separates it from Sweden to the west. The Estonian flag, known as \\"sinimustvalge\\" in Estonian translates to \\"blue-black-white\\" in English. The flag holds a considerable amount of significance and history, as it symbolizes various elements pertaining to Estonia and its culture. 1. Blue: The blue in Estonia's flag represents the sky, as well as the country's numerous bodies of water, including the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Finland, and the many lakes and rivers that dot the landscape. Additionally, the blue also signifies loyalty, particularly towards the principles of freedom and independence that Estonia values so deeply. 2. Black: The black stripe symbolizes the rich and dark soil which covers much of the Estonian land, spanning from the fertile plains to the dense forests. Additionally, black is associated with the endurance and determination of the Estonian people, who have faced significant challenges throughout their history, including multiple foreign invasions and occupations. 3. White: Representing purity and aspiration, the white stripe signifies Estonia's pursuit of a bright future and speaks to the land's snowy winters. Furthermore, the white also symbolizes the virtue and hard work of the Estonian people, acknowledging their commitment to rebuilding their nation, despite the obstacles that have arisen from its tumultuous past. The flag of Estonia was initially adopted on November 21, 1918, after the country declared its independence from the Russian Empire. Subsequently, it was first raised on December 12, 1918, to mark the establishment of the independent Estonian government. Although Estonia was later occupied by both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, the flag never lost its symbolic importance. It was once again officially reinstated on August 7, 1990, as the national flag of Estonia just before the country regained its independence from the Soviet Union on August 20, 1991. Today, the Estonian flag continues to serve as a testament to the country's resilience, hope, and national identity, standing proudly as a symbol of its rich heritage and a bright future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News organizations who were a part of the traveling press pool covering the president's surprise OPTIONS: - Afghanistan visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - Barack Obama visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - CNN visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - Kabul visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - Obama visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - Twitter visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - Washington visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. - White House visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports.","completion":"Afghanistan visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. This option is the most logical continuation of the passage as it accurately describes the purpose of the president's surprise visit to Kabul, Afghanistan, and details the role of the traveling press pool in maintaining the secrecy surrounding the president's arrival.

The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but it completely fails to deliver. I watched it with about five friends and no-one laughed for the entire film. The jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way... the story line is crap, and they never answer the question... WHERE DOES THE SH*T GO? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters are developed, the plots so thin it's nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny??

Write an article with the title: \\"Ichiro Suzuki plans to play 'in 2016 and beyond'\\"","completion":"Title: Ichiro Suzuki Plans to Play 'in 2016 and Beyond' Ichiro Suzuki, the legendary Japanese right fielder who has made an indelible mark on both Major League Baseball (MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), recently announced his plans to continue playing the game he loves 'in 2016 and beyond'. This article provides an overview of Suzuki's illustrious career, underscores the reasons for his decision, and outlines the potential paths that may lie ahead for this remarkable player in the coming seasons. Ichiro Suzuki started his professional baseball career in Japan, where he played for the Orix BlueWave in the Nippon Professional Baseball league. In his nine seasons with the team, Suzuki won seven consecutive batting titles, three MVP awards, and led the league in hits for six seasons in total. However, it was his move to the major leagues that catapulted him to global fame. In 2001, Suzuki signed with the Seattle Mariners to commence his groundbreaking MLB career. With his consistently strong performance, he quickly became a fan favorite, mesmerizing the league with his speed, discipline, and superb skills both in hitting and fielding. Suzuki claimed the AL Rookie of the Year and MVP awards in his first season while setting a single-season rookie record for hits. In the following seasons, he continued to accumulate accolades and broke numerous records, including the prestigious single-season hits record in 2004 with an astonishing 262 hits. To this day, he remains the only player to record a minimum of 200 hits for ten consecutive seasons. After twelve fruitful seasons with the Mariners, Suzuki was traded to the New York Yankees and later the Miami Marlins, where he remains today. Despite his age, 'Ichiro' – as he is affectionately known – continues to make significant contributions to his team, proving that he still has much to offer the game of baseball. The decision to continue playing 'in 2016 and beyond' was clearly not taken lightly. At 42 years of age, Suzuki continues to defy expectations, displaying an enduring passion for the sport, which has compelled him to prolong his career. However, besides his devotion, several factors have driven Suzuki's resolution. A primary motivator is undoubtedly his pursuit of the prestigious 3,000-hit milestone in the MLB. Having amassed over 4,000 hits in both MLB and NPB combined, Suzuki's next target is to join an elite group of players who have reached the 3,000-hit mark solely in the major leagues. Moreover, Suzuki's decision to keep playing reflects his personal philosophy on the game and his approach to life. Although he has achieved remarkable success in his career, he remains humble and committed to constantly improving his skills. For Suzuki, baseball is a never-ending pursuit of perfection, and as long as he can continue contributing to his team at a high level, there is no reason for him to step away from the game he loves. As Suzuki moves forward, the options for his career's future are abundant. Whether he chooses to return to the Marlins or explore opportunities with other teams, Suzuki is assured to bolster any roster with his unrivaled determination, expertise, and on-field presence. Apart from his playing career, there remains considerable speculation about Suzuki's potential involvement in coaching or mentoring roles. With his vast experience and unique insights into the game, he could positively impact players at various stages in their careers – from rookies to seasoned veterans. In conclusion, Ichiro Suzuki's decision to play 'in 2016 and beyond' is a testament to his passion, resilience, and incomparable work ethic. As he continues to chase milestones while providing invaluable leadership, the baseball world eagerly anticipates what the next innings of this extraordinary player's story will bring. Regardless of his specific path, one thing is certain: Suzuki's commitment to excellence and love for the game will continue to inspire and captivate fans the world over."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Female fruit flies rid of the ability to smell food outlive their peers.The sense of smell may be linked to the cellular ageing process in many other organisms--even people.A link has recently been found between sensory experiences and lifespan in both worms and flies.For example, Scott Pletcher, a biologist at the University of Michigan, found that eliminating fruit flies' ability to smell enabled them to live nearly 20 percent longer than flies with an intact sense of smell. Pletcher's team reasoned that food smells were the ones most likely to affect ageing, as nutrition and longevity are known to be linked in many organisms.To test the idea that food odors affect lifespan, Pletcher's team eliminated flies' ability to smell carbon dioxide, which is produced by some fly foods.They left the rest of the smelling system intact. This intervention had no effect on male flies, but the females lived 30 percent longer than normal.Pletcher thinks eliminating the ability to smell CO2may deprive flies of information about food availability.This could signal to cells that food is scarce, causing processes that promote survival.Indeed, his team found that the CO2-insensitive female flies stored extra fat and that both males and females immune to CO2were more resistant to stress than normal flies.Pletcher isn't sure why the change in his fruit flies only affected the lifespan of the females, but he suggests that females may simply be more sensitive to the odor of CO2. A smell or taste that stretches lifespan in humans could be a potential preventative for age-related disease, he adds.Although in fruit flies it appears to be the smell of CO2that affects ageing, he says that an analogue in humans might be a smell or taste linked to human food--or a lack of it.Matt Kaeberlein studies ageing at the University of Washington in Seattle. He cautions that we don't know whether ageing and smell are linked in mammals.But \\" we definitely undergo physiological changes in response to smelling...

When a triangle has two sides that are in the same proportion to another triangle and their included angle is equal, these triangles are similar. Be careful not to confuse this theorem with the Side-Angle-Side theorem for congruence. For congruence, the two sides with their included angle must be identical; for similarity, the proportions of the sides must be same and the angle must be identical. For example: Triangle ABC and DEF are similar is angle A = angle D and AB/DE = AC/DF. Using a ruler, measure two sides of triangle ABC and label them with that measure. Make sure triangle DEF is oriented in the same direction and measure the same two sides. Label these sides as well. Example: Measures of triangle ABC; side AB = 4 cm and side AC = 8 cm. Measures of triangle DEF; side DE = 2 cm and side DF = 4 cm. Using a protractor, measure the included angle, or, the angle between the two sides that you already measured. For this theorem, the measure of the angle should be identical in both triangles. Example: Angle A in triangle ABC is 26°. Angle D in triangle DEF is also 26°. To use the SAS theorem, the sides of the triangles must be proportional to each other. To calculate this, simply use the formula AB/DE = AC/DF. Example: AB/DE = AC/DF; 4/2 = 8/4; 2 = 2. The proportions of the two triangles are equal. Once you have determined that the proportions of two sides of a triangle and their included angle are equal, you can use the SAS theorem in your proof. Example: Because AB/DE = AC/DF and angle A = angle D, triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF. Note: If angle A did not equal angle D, the triangles would not be similar. Also, if the proportions were not equal, the triangles would not be similar.","completion":"The article explains the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) similarity theorem, which states that if two triangles have proportional sides and equal included angles, they are considered similar, and demonstrates how to verify and apply this theorem in a geometric proof."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days.

The premise gives information about a set of guides produced by GAO that aim to help organizations confront a problem, while the hypothesis suggests that these guides actually caused the problem. Step 2: Comparison Since we have interpreted both the statements, we can now compare them. The hypothesis proposes a casual relationship (that GAO’s guides caused the problem), but our premise merely states that these guides are designed to address a problem without implying causation. Step 3: Evaluation Given the lack of information pointing towards a causative relationship in the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"The four guides produced by GAO caused the problem\\" is entailed by the premise. Step 4: Conclusion Therefore, the premise \\"GAO produced a set of four guides to help organizations confront the problem,\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"The four guides produced by GAO caused the problem.\\" Essentially, this is because the premise does not provide any evidence that the guides have contributed to the origin of the problem; on the contrary, it suggests they are a response to it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"The review can be categorized as negative. In the given review, the author begins by providing a seemingly neutral remark, stating that the bookmarks are pretty. However, the reviewer quickly shifts focus to the shortcomings of the product. The expression \\"not worth buying\\" in the title already suggests a negative sentiment towards the product. One of the main reasons the reviewer deems the bookmarks as not worth buying is the material they are made of - heavy paper. The text suggests that these bookmarks are not resistant to damage caused by liquid spills and will become useless if exposed to any type of liquid. This aspect of the material shows a lack of durability and reliability, which may deter potential customers, especially those who value sturdy bookmarks. Additionally, the review's conclusion explicitly recommends against purchasing the product by stating, \\"If you prefer a sturdy bookmark, do not buy this product.\\" This strong statement, coupled with the mention of the product's flaws, provides a definite negative sentiment towards the bookmarks.

The store is 62Â miles away from Marfa, where Dean filmed Giant in 1955. Inside, store owner Juanita prepares for another day on the job while listening to Gospel music on the radio, and also calls for Jimmy Dean by name. Meanwhile, one of the Disciples, Sissy, comes in late after helping out at the truck stop; Juanita remarks that more members could arrive soon. Another one, Mona, is taking a late bus. After Sissy worries about the weather (\\"118 degrees in the shade\\"), a flashback to a stormy night in 1955 occurs. Coming inside for shelter, Sissy asks about three friends of hers: Mona, Sydney and Joseph Qualley (or \\"Joe\\" for short).[1]:131 Joe is busy stocking up some new issues of Photoplay magazine; Mona arrives late due to the weather. To Juanita's chagrin, Sissy, Mona and Joe go up at the counter and begin singing the doo-wop tune \\"Sincerely\\", which Juanita opposes, preferring to listen only to Gospel music. Back in 1975, another two Disciples, Stella Mae and Edna Louise, make their way to the five-and-dime, bringing a red jacket that the club used to wear. Mona joins them and explains that the bus she was riding on broke down and had to be repaired. Looking at a group picture (with James Dean), she recalls the last time the Disciples, all dressed in jackets, came together. As reunion preparations continue, so does the flashback. (At this point, Sissy's friends joyfully break the news that Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean will be visiting the McCarthy vicinity to film Giant; auditions will be carried out across that area. This only prompts Mona's desires to play alongside Dean, her idol, in that film.) When Mona reveals that Dean chose her to raise his son, Juanita thinks that she is \\"warped and demented\\".

Discovered in a shipwreck near the island of Antikythera, Greece, the device is considered an extraordinary example of Hellenistic-era engineering and technology. Constructed around 150-100 BC, the Antikythera mechanism consists of a complex system of around 37 gears, dials, and pointers, all meticulously arranged within a wooden and bronze housing. This technology and the precision of the gears allowed the mechanism to precisely measure and predict astronomical phenomena such as lunar phases, solar and lunar eclipses, and the positions of various celestial bodies. The Antikythera mechanism is a testament to the advanced knowledge and understanding of astronomy that the ancient Greeks possessed. It is an early example of a sophisticated, gear-driven mechanism designed to model and predict the workings of the cosmos. Decoding the complexity of this ancient mechanical marvel has given us valuable insight into the innovative and scientific prowess of the Hellenistic period. In conclusion, the statement provided indeed contains the correct answer to the question. The Antikythera mechanism is the name of the 37 gear computer which noted the motions of the Sun and Moon.

However, the premise does not specifically mention what that particular action or event is. Hypothesis: \\"We assumed that Kitchell brought us food.\\" - This statement suggests that the speaker or the group have made an assumption that Kitchell's responsibility was bringing them food. In other words, they have formulated a supposition that Kitchell is the one who has provided them with food. Now, let's evaluate the given options (A, B, and C) to determine if it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis: A) Yes: This answer would imply that the premise directly confirms the hypothesis, and that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. However, the premise does not contain explicit information about the action or event in question. It could be entirely unrelated to Kitchell bringing food, indicating that there is an insufficient basis for inferring the hypothesis directly from the premise. Therefore, this choice is not valid. B) It is not possible to tell: This answer is the most appropriate one given the information provided. Since the premise does not directly state what the specific action or event involving Kitchell is, it becomes impossible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise. Although it is plausible that Kitchell might have brought food, other possibilities cannot be entirely ruled out. C) No: This answer implies that the hypothesis is completely unrelated to or incompatible with the premise. However, while the premise doesn't provide enough information to fully confirm the hypothesis, it does not inherently contradict it either. This makes option C an unlikely choice. In conclusion, based on the information available, the best answer to whether it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, would be (B) - it is not possible to tell. The given premise does not provide enough specific detail to prove or disprove the hypothesis, leading to the conclusion that one cannot definitively determine the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sizable Lutheran missions arose for the first time during the 19th century. Early missionary attempts during the century after the Reformation did not succeed. However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education. Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including Karl Graul. After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work. In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples. In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII. Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining. After missionaries to China, including those of the Lutheran Church of China, were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia. The Lutheran Mission in New Guinea, though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel.

Context: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

Article: How often do you let other people like a bad driver, a rude waiter, or an angry boss, change your mood ? Sixteen years ago I learned a lesson. I got in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane when all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver used his brakes , the tires made a loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just 3cm from the back of the other car. I couldn't believe it. But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head around and he started shouting at us. I couldn't believe it! My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. So, I said, \\"Why did you just do that? This guy could have killed us!\\" And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call, \\"The Law of the Garbage Truck\\". He said, \\"Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger and disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump it. And if you let them, they'll dump it on you.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

Context: Treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist? Answer the above question based on the context below: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. Answer:","completion":"The name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist is Miriam Makeba. Makeba, a South African singer and civil rights activist, married Stokely Carmichael, a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement, in March 1968. This marriage led to her being perceived as a militant and extremist by conservatives in the United States, which caused a significant decline in her popularity. Her fanbase, especially among white Americans, dwindled. Consequently, her performances were canceled, press coverage substantially decreased, and both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation placed her under surveillance. Ultimately, Makeba was banned from returning to the US while she was traveling in the Bahamas and had to relocate to Guinea with her husband. She did not return to the US until 1987. During her time in Guinea, Makeba became more vocal in her criticism of the US government's racial policies and recorded songs referencing prominent African political figures like Patrice Lumumba and Malcolm X."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given these facts, what do high pressure systems allow among the following options: - water conservation - Veins and arteries. - hydrogen and oxygen - Animal survival - to move people - heat energy - heating liquids - sailplanes to fly The answer to this question is:","completion":"High pressure systems allow sailplanes to fly. High pressure systems typically result in clear, stable weather, which is ideal for flying, particularly for sailplanes. Sailplanes, also known as gliders, are a type of aircraft without engines that rely on the natural movement of air currents to stay aloft and travel great distances. In order to achieve extended flight, sailplanes depend on two primary atmospheric phenomena: thermals and ridge lift. Thermals are columns of rising warm air that form when the sun heats the Earth's surface unevenly. As a result, parcels of air become warmer and less dense, causing them to rise. Sailplane pilots seek out thermals and circle within them to gain altitude. High pressure systems, which feature areas of descending air, lead to clear skies and plenty of sunshine that can generate thermals, making it easier for sailplane pilots to locate and use them for sustained flight. Ridge lift is another essential atmospheric factor for sailplanes, arising when continuous winds blow against the side of a hill or mountain. These winds are deflected upwards by the terrain, creating a zone of lift along the ridge or sloping terrain. Since high pressure systems typically bring steady wind flows, they contribute to the formation of ridge lift. In summary, high pressure systems create clear and stable weather conditions that make it feasible for sailplanes to fly. By providing favorable atmospheric conditions, such as thermals and ridge lift, high pressure systems maximize the flight efficiency and performance of sailplanes, offering pilots the opportunity to experience extended, engineless flights over great distances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: From age eight to eleven, I studied at a small school in Bath, England. It was a small school of four classes, with about twenty-five children in each class according to age. For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day.

The vibrant orange hue of sweet potatoes, thanks to their high beta-carotene content, is also linked to improved eye health and protection against certain types of cancer. Furthermore, sweet potatoes are a great source of fiber, which is essential for maintaining digestive health and keeping blood sugar levels stable. They also contain essential minerals such as potassium, calcium, and iron, contributing to overall well-being. The versatility of sweet potatoes extends beyond their culinary uses and health benefits – they can also be readily incorporated into a variety of dishes due to their compatibility with a wide range of flavors.

In today's globalized world, media texts come in various forms and convey diverse meanings that touch different aspects of our lives. These media texts, such as news articles, advertisements, films, TV shows, and even social media content, communicate layered messages from different perspectives. To navigate and understand the world around us, it is essential to develop knowledge of social, cultural, political, and economic meanings and subtexts of media texts. 1. Social meanings and subtexts: These elements focus on the relationships between individuals, groups, and communities and may refer to societal norms, values, or issues. For example, a film reflecting on gender roles may depict men and women in stereotypical ways, but a closer analysis could uncover subtexts questioning these norms and pushing for more equal representations. 2. Cultural meanings and subtexts: Media texts are rooted in the culture and traditions of their producers and intended audiences. They reflect cultural symbols, beliefs, and practices of a particular society. Understanding cultural subtexts allows us to become more aware of our biases and assumptions, and how they inform our worldview. For example, a documentary exploring a foreign culture might challenge our assumptions about what is \\"normal\\" or \\"right.\\" 3. Political meanings and subtexts: Many media texts touch upon issues related to politics, such as power dynamics, governance, or conflicts. The media can communicate political messages explicitly, like news reporting, or implicitly, like in a satirical TV show. Understanding political subtexts enables us to recognize and assess political opinions, identify propaganda, and make informed decisions as citizens. 4. Economic meanings and subtexts: The economic aspects of media texts refer to the market forces, business strategies, and financial implications present in media content. For example, an advertisement may promote consumerism, while a news article may discuss the stock market. Understanding economic subtexts can help us to discern the motivations behind the media content and its impact on our lives. Developing knowledge of the different meanings and subtexts requires a multifaceted approach, which includes: A. Engaging with diverse media content: Consumption and analysis of various media texts from different formats, sources, and perspectives broaden our understanding of their contexts and meanings. B. Critical thinking skills: Interrogating the motives behind media texts, scrutinizing potential bias, and questioning assumptions lead to a deeper understanding of the messages and their intended effects. C. Education and awareness: Acquiring knowledge of social, cultural, political, and economic theories and concepts aids in interpreting and contextualizing media texts. D. Active discussion and sharing: Conversations with others from varied backgrounds, interests, and experiences promote a cross-pollination of ideas and foster the growth of a more well-rounded understanding of media texts. In summary, developing knowledge of social, cultural, political, and economic meanings and subtexts of media texts can help us become more informed and responsible consumers of media, sharpen our critical thinking skills, and give us the tools to participate actively in our interconnected global community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

On 7 March , TF Muir crossed the Kyll and took a bridge across the River Ahr on 8 March at Dollendorf . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these sentences do not mean the same thing because they reverse the details of which river was crossed by TF Muir on which dates and the location of the intact bridge seized. The first sentence says that on March 7, TF Muir crossed the Ahr River, then on March 8, TF Muir seized a bridge that was still intact across the Kyll River at Dollendorf. This suggests that the task force moved from the Ahr river to the Kyll river. The second sentence, in contrast, says that on March 7, TF Muir crossed the Kyll River, then on March 8, took a bridge across the Ahr River at Dollendorf. This version proposes that the movement of TF Muir was from the Kyll River to the Ahr River. Keep in mind that rivers act as natural barriers in military operations. Crossing them and seizing bridges can be vital keypoints in military strategy because it can cut off enemy reinforcements and supplies and prevent them from retreating to a more secure position on the other side of the river. Thus, the two sentences describe different sequences of events which could potentially have significantly dissimilar strategic implications in the context of military operations. For instance, depending on the geography and the location of enemy forces, seizing control over a bridge on one river versus the other might make a large difference in terms of strategic superiority.

Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

Most of your swing is generated in your hands and wrists. If your hands are extended your bat speed will slow and your power will drop. The palm of your dominant (top) hand should remain facing upwards through contact in order to drive through the ball. Don't over-swing, or try to put any extra power into it. Most of the power in a swing is generated through your hips and wrists. Allow that power to flow through your body smoothly. Trying to swing extra hard will harm rather than help you. Trying to \\"muscle\\" through the ball will usually result in your body tightening up, which compromises your natural kinetic chain and prevents your wrists from snapping into your swing as quickly. Light muscles are fast muscles. Tight muscles are slow muscles. Properly following through is important for multiple reasons. Not only will it help you to add all-important distance generating backspin to the ball, but it will help point out any flaws in your swing. In most cases, you want your hands to finish high which ensures that the bat head stays through the hitting zone as long as possible. Summary:","completion":"When you want to hit a ball with power, it's important to stay balanced and use your whole body. Move your weight forward smoothly and keep your hands close to your body. Your swing comes mostly from your hands, wrists, and hips. Don't try to hit too hard, because it's better to let your body work together like a smooth machine. Make sure to finish your swing with your hands high up, so your bat stays in the hitting zone for a longer time. This will help your ball go farther and show you if there are any problems with your swing."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: At a doctor's office, two women are having their annual physical done. Jessie goes in first and is told that that she should go see a dermatologist about the skin issues she is having. The doctor then sees Martha who is having a pain in her right arm and who also has hypertension. The doctor talks to Martha about her issues and then heads home for the day. But I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. What is an answer for this question: Which patient will be more likely to be told to exercise more? Answer:","completion":"Martha would be more likely to be told to exercise more, as she has hypertension and exercise is a recommended treatment for lowering blood pressure. Jessie's skin issues would likely be addressed by a dermatologist rather than through exercise."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Options: a ) 15.25 days , b ) 16.25 days , c ) 17.25 days , d ) 18.25 days , e ) 19.25 days","completion":"Vinoth can complete the work in 20 days, so he does 1/20 of the work per day. Prakash can complete the work in 25 days, so he does 1/25 of the work per day. Together, they can complete (1/20 + 1/25) of the work per day = (5 + 4)/100 = 9/100 of the work per day. For the first 3 days, they worked together, so they completed 3*(9/100) = 27/100 of the work. Remaining work is 1 - 27/100 = 73/100. Now, only Prakash has to complete the remaining work which he does at a rate of 1/25 of the work per day. So, the time required to complete the remaining work = (73/100) / (1/25) = 73 * (25/1) = 18.25 days. So, the answer is d) 18.25 days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who is helped by the museum exhibits to re-open the planetarium?, using the article: In 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah. The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly.

Australian historian Peter Shergold confirms the findings of many scholars that the standard of living for US industrial workers was higher than in Europe. He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living , the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America. Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services. Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from 17.63 a week to 21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week.

Revisiting Coen Country for Odd Men Their steady progress as filmmakers contradicts the prescribed path for independent (or at least independent-minded) directors in Hollywood: Make a few small-budget movies, maybe in a genre like film noir, then climb the Hollywood pay scale until, like Bryan Singer or Christopher Nolan, you’re given the big-budget summer extravaganza. What keeps filmmakers on this path — other than money — is the ability to make the kind of films they want. The Coens have been able to navigate their way all along, without once setting foot on a “Batman” soundstage. “We’ve never navigated anything,” Ethan said. “We’ve been lucky.” It’s not luck, however, that the two have been working in lockstep their whole Hollywood careers. Sometimes Ethan, 50, is credited as the writer, and sometimes Joel, 53, as director. But in reality both conceive the film, write the screenplay and direct, and edit under the joint pseudonym Roderick Jaynes. You think your family is close? These guys finish each other’s movies. That may work wonderfully on the set, where actors call them the Two-Headed Director. In an interview, however, the Coens are tough sledding. Like many close brothers they have developed an almost impregnable wall of in-jokes and verbal shorthand broken up by inexplicable fits of laughter, shared references and large inaudible patches when they speak over each other in a race to the next punch line. Their new movie, “Burn After Reading,” is set in Washington, or rather in the gray area between the old file-and-dagger Washington of Allen Dulles and the creeping suburbs that surround it. Frances McDormand, Joel’s wife, plays Linda Litzke, a literally wide-eyed employee of Hardbodies Fitness gym, whose signature line, “I’m trying to reinvent myself,” underscores her belief that four expensive plastic surgeries will help her meet a better class of man on Internet dating sites. Through a series of strained coincidences (if plots had their own Hollywood guild, “Burn After Reading” wouldn’t qualify for a union card), Linda receives a computer disk containing a draft of a memoir written by Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an angry alcoholic relic of the C.I.A. whose wife (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with a federal marshal and aging Lothario (George Clooney). Linda decides to trade the memoir for cash, aided by a dimwitted personal trainer played by Brad Pitt, showing again that he’s a great character actor in a leading man’s body. With its coldly satirical tone, stylized dialogue and broadly drawn characters, “Burn” will feel like familiar territory for longtime fans, a return to Coen Country for Odd Men. Is “Burn” a deliberate return to form, a step away from being Very Important Oscar-Winning Filmmakers? “It was nothing like that,” Ethan said. “To tell you the truth, we started writing down actors we wanted to work with.” One was Richard Jenkins, who has appeared in three Coen films, starting with “The Man Who Wasn’t There” in 2001. “They’re incredibly consistent, absolutely the same,” said Mr. Jenkins, who has also worked with Hollywood’s other best-known brother team, Bobby and Peter Farrelly. Those filmmakers have more defined roles, he said, but the Coens are almost interchangeable on the set when working with the actors. “I can’t imagine them not being together making a movie. I can’t think of one without the other.” The Two-Headed Director is one way to think about the Coens. Another — to borrow a concept from the horror movies they grew up on — is that they share the same brain, one cut crosswise. Ethan, whose first reaction to almost any question is to reject the premise out of hand with “No, that’s not it” or “I don’t remember,” occupies the lower half, and Joel, who tends to pause, then provide a slightly more politic answer, occupies the other. Together the Coens, like any divided brain, have little capacity for abstraction or intellectualism, and they resist delving into the philosophy or the processes underpinning their films. Analyzing their work, Joel says, “is just not something that interests us.” Profiles of the pair frequently mention that Ethan wrote his senior thesis at Princeton on Wittgenstein — the sort of biographical detail film-studies types love — but, when asked, Ethan said he “can’t honestly remember” what he wrote. The sons of academics, they were raised in a heavily Jewish section in Minneapolis. But asking the Coens how growing up there affected their movies is like asking J .R. R. Tolkien how much time he spent in Middle-Earth before writing “The Hobbit.” Their next film, which they’re working on now, is based on their childhood, but beyond that, they give no answers to how their city, its social structure or the dialect they heard as relative outsiders affected their work. “Scandinavian. That about sums it up,” Joel said. They will cop to this: They watched a lot of television. Now in their mid-50s, they’re part of the last generation of filmmakers with a serendipitous relationship to old Hollywood, before VHS and infomercials, when being a cinephile meant watching whatever was on the late show. “There wasn’t HBO or movies on demand. There wasn’t a lot of choice,” Joel said, adding that they watched “a lot of Hercules movies” and that they and Mr. Clooney have wanted to do a Hercules movie for years. “The local affiliate had the entire Joseph E. Levine catalog,” Ethan said. “A lot of horror, but he also owned Fellini’s movies, so occasionally, ‘8 ½’ would be mixed in. All dubbed.” “Badly dubbed,” Joel agreed. “Marcello sounded like Hugh Grant. Very stuttery.” In their teens they began to make their own movies on Super 8 millimeter, starting with a short film, “Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go.” “It didn’t have a strong narrative,” Joel said. “It was really based on the fact that Ethan had a striking resemblance to Kissinger,” establishing a Coen brothers theme early: the desperate character looking for some kind of payoff. After college — Princeton for Ethan, New York University for Joel — they had various jobs film editing before making “Blood Simple” in 1984. Since then they’ve moved with deliberateness of an airport novelist, putting out a film at least once every two years. Even “No Country,” an adaptation, was sold on the basis of their script. “The alchemy was already there on the page,” said Daniel Battsek, the chief executive of Miramax, which co-produced the film. “The only question of whether it would still be there on screen.” One explanation for their longevity is money — the lack of it. All told, the Coens have spent an estimated 340 million, the cost of a couple of summer blockbusters. “They control their own destiny,” said Eric Fellner, co-chairman of the British production company Working Title, which has been involved in five Coen brothers films, including “Burn After Reading.” “I’ve talked to them many times about doing something bigger, something smaller, something more commercial. It’s very hard to find anything that interests them.” Joel said: “To be quite honest our movies have never broken any records in terms of box office. We’ve never operated at that level. We’ve never threatened the bottom line of any company that finances us. So they’re happy to finance us, because the stakes are so low.” “Even our Hercules movie would not be terribly expensive,” he said. (The sound of laughter is again heard.) Coen brothers films may be cheap, but they’re not small. Long before “No Country” they built large frames for their films, then filled in their themes of morality, violence and the failure of communication using everyday vernacular, like the gangster slang of “Miller’s Crossing” or the flat Minnesota accents of “Fargo.” With apologies to Ethan’s Princeton thesis adviser, that part is very Wittgenstein. The opening scenes of “Burn After Reading,” inside C.I.A. headquarters, make it appear that the Coens are flirting with another genre, in this case the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, like “Three Days of the Condor” or “The Parallax View.” Then the film takes a sharp twist into a gray zone without any apparent moral order — or at least the kind embodied in “No Country” by Carla Jean Moss or in “Fargo” in the final speech given by Marge, the policewoman played by Ms. McDormand. “No character offers that kind of perspective” in “Burn,” Ethan says. Even Cox’s old superiors at the C.I.A. (played by J. K. Simmons and David Rasche), who the brothers wanted to function “like a Greek chorus,” seem bewildered by events and — like many real C.I.A. agents, one suspects — just close the file rather than dwell on how things could go so wrong. The Coens are big Hitchcock fans, and “Burn After Reading” has a MacGuffin (the device to move the plot along), in this case Cox’s memoir. What’s striking is that this MacGuffin, unlike the suitcase in “No Country,” is worthless. “Why in God’s name would they think that’s worth anything?” the analyst’s wife says in the film. Ethan said the choice was deliberate: “We liked that idea. There’s nothing at the center.” It’s maybe the oddest turn, as if the audience watching “The Maltese Falcon” for the first time knew that the bird was a fake all along. But a final attempt to draw out the Coens about the meaning of “Burn After Reading” ends the interview to the evident relief of both brothers, who suddenly relax and seem ready to talk. “Hey,” Joel said, his voice brightening, “didn’t Karl Popper go after Wittgenstein with a poker?” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text discuss the filmmaking careers of Joel and Ethan Coen, known as the Coen Brothers, who have successfully navigated Hollywood while maintaining their unique style and independence.

The text also highlights their latest movie at the time, \\"Burn After Reading,\\" which features a satirical tone, stylized dialogue, and broadly drawn characters that will be familiar to long-time fans of their previous films.

So, let's subtract 45352*p from both sides of the equation (it's like moving apples from one side to the other!): 45358*p - 45352*p - 60 = 45352*p - 45352*p Step 2: Now, let's do the subtraction: (45358 - 45352)*p - 60 = 0 6*p - 60 = 0 Step 3: Now, let's add 60 to both sides of the equation. It's like we're making the problem easier by removing 60 marbles. 6*p = 60 Step 4: Last step! We need to divide both sides by 6 to find out how many apples (p) we have: 6*p / 6 = 60 / 6 p = 10 So, we found out that we have 10 apples (p) in our problem.

Gather required materials: To perform duct tape wart removal, you will need duct tape, a clean cloth or towel, warm water, soap, a pumice stone or emery board, and a pair of scissors. 2. Clean the affected area: Wash the wart and the surrounding skin using warm water and soap. Gently dry the skin with a clean towel. 3. Prepare the duct tape: Cut a piece of duct tape slightly larger than the wart itself. Make sure there is enough tape to cover the wart and a small area around it. The tape should completely cover the wart and stick to the surrounding skin. 4. Apply the duct tape: Position the duct tape over the wart, ensuring it is centered and adheres well to the skin. Press the tape gently but firmly to ensure proper adhesion. 5. Leave the tape in place: Keep the duct tape on the wart for six days. If the tape falls off during this time, simply replace it with a new piece and continue the process until the full six days have been completed. 6. Remove the duct tape: After six days, remove the duct tape and soak the wart area in warm water for 10-15 minutes. This will help soften the wart. 7. Exfoliate the area: Using a pumice stone or emery board, gently remove the dead skin from the top layer of the wart. Be careful not to damage the surrounding healthy skin. 8. Give the wart area a break: Allow the wart to rest, uncovered, overnight or for a full 24-hour period. This allows the skin to breathe and recover. 9. Repeat the process: If the wart has not completely disappeared, apply a new piece of duct tape and repeat steps 4-8. Continue this process for up to two months or until the wart is fully removed. 10. Monitor for any signs of infection: If the skin around the wart becomes red, swollen, or oozes pus, discontinue the treatment and consult a healthcare professional. Remember, this process requires patience and consistency. It may take several weeks or even months for the duct tape treatment to fully remove the wart. If you do not see improvement or the wart continues to grow, it is recommended to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Now, I have a new situation: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Answer this question please: Who is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels? Answer:","completion":"Ronaldo is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels, as he is more conscious about his diet and consumes an appropriate amount of fat and cholesterol. His diet choices reduce the risk factors associated with high lipid levels in his blood, and thus, decrease his chances of developing health issues such as cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Jeff's lack of concern for nutrition can lead to the consumption of an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol, which can significantly contribute to increased blood lipid levels. These increased levels, as mentioned in the background provided, are associated with a higher risk of developing health problems such as narrowing of the arteries and atherosclerosis (build-up of plaque in the artery walls), increasing the risk for cardiovascular diseases. In general, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet by considering the appropriate amount of macro and micronutrients for the body to function optimally. This includes mindfully consuming sources of dietary lipids such as saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. As Ronaldo embodies this approach to nutrition, his likelihood of having increased blood lipid levels is lower when compared to Jeff, who tends to consume excessive amounts of unhealthy dietary lipids without any dietary restrictions or concern for nutrition. Therefore, Ronaldo is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels than Jeff."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Adrian Lukis, born on March 28, 1958, in Birmingham, England, is an experienced British actor with a career spanning over three decades. He has appeared in various television shows, films, and theatrical productions, showcasing his versatility as an actor. In \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" George Wickham is a charming and amiable character, although his true colors are slowly revealed as the story unfolds. Wickham is an officer in the militia and acquaintances of the Bennet family. His charming demeanor initially captivates the women in the story, especially Elizabeth Bennet, the novel's protagonist.

Figures released by the Ministry of Justice reveal that criminals are more likely to escape prosecution in London, where fewer than a quarter are caught. On public transport conviction rates are even worse, with just 13 per cent of all crimes solved by British Transport Police. New figures released by the Ministry of Justice show that police are solving fewer than one in three crimes. Despite overall crime falling since 2004, conviction rates have remained at just 30 per cent, the Daily Mirror reported. In total, there were 3.5 million crimes committed in England and Wales during 2013/14, but only a million ended in a criminal being convicted. Around 704,000 crimes were reported in London over the past year, but the Metropolitan Police managed to solve 169,000 of these cases - 24 per cent. In Wales the situation is more positive. In the last 12 months the force convicted 10,800 criminals for 18,600 - a success rate of 58 per cent. Police forces in Northumbria, Cumbria, Norfolk and Hertfordshire all have success rates of more than 40 per cent and appear in the top five in a list of conviction rates. The Metropolitan Police, appears in the lowest five forces for conviction rates. Warwickshire, West Midlands and Bedfordshire also appear in this group with low conviction rates - less than the average 29 per cent for England and Wales. British Transport Police, which covers crimes on railways and roads is at the bottom of the conviction rate league table - with a success rate of just 13 per cent. The figures include crimes where an offender has accepted a caution, or where a crime has been 'taken into consideration' as part of other proceedings. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the force had 'introduced measures to bring more offenders to justice as part of our total war on crime.' However, despite the low conviction rates, it is feared that the prison population could swell by 15 per cent by 2020 to almost 100,000 - leaving jails struggling to cope with a surge in violent and sexual offenders. The Ministry of Justice predicted the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade. It means thousands more prison places will be needed, because the current capacity is only 88,015.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell!

Answer:","completion":"Diarmait Ó Conchobair, also known as Diarmait Ua Conchobair, was a Prince (Irish: Rioghdha) of the historical province of Connacht in medieval Ireland. Connacht was one of the four traditional provinces that make up the island of Ireland, with the other three being Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. Therefore, the country associated with Diarmait Ó Conchobair as a prince is Ireland. During the time of Diarmait Ó Conchobair's reign, Ireland was composed of various smaller kingdoms and territories. The island was divided into provinces, which further comprised local tribes and clans. The provinces of Ireland controlled by their respective rulers contributed to the island's complex political landscape in the medieval period. Diarmait Ó Conchobair belonged to the O'Conor dynasty, one of the well-known and powerful ruling families in Connacht. It is essential to note that during this time, Ireland as a united and centralized nation under the rulership of a single king did not exist. Even though a high king (Ard Rí) was designated throughout history, the high kingship was more about prestige and acted as a symbolic figurehead rather than representing a consolidated political power. The provinces and local rulers held more significant control over territories and their subjects in Ireland during that period. Diarmait Ó Conchobair, as Prince of Connacht, would have ruled over a portion of the province alongside other regional chieftains and noble families. However, as the medieval era ended and Ireland underwent changes in rulership, territorial divisions, and political structures, local rulers like Diarmait Ó Conchobair lost their power and influence. In conclusion, Diarmait Ó Conchobair was the Prince of Connacht, a province in medieval Ireland. His reign reflects the complex political landscape of Ireland during that historical period, which was marked by multiple territories and rulers rather than a unified and centralized kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He found it difficult to build with wood, but easy with metal, because he found the OPTIONS: -wood to be intuitive. -metal to be intuitive.","completion":"He found it difficult to build with wood, but easy with metal, because he found the metal to be intuitive. The subtle texture and the firmness of metal appealed to his sensibilities. They fell perfectly in line with his mechanical mindset and precisely honed skills. Every time he picked up a metallic object, whether it was a plain sheet, a rod, or a complex component, he could easily visualize its potential and its transformation into something functional, beautiful, or both. It was not just the obvious solidity and durability of the metal that motivated him, but also its ductility and malleability. It was like a blank canvas, yet it was sturdy and resilient, offering him the freedom to manipulate its form while standing robust against the practical demands of daily life. Metal's response to his tools was also vastly satisfying. The way it yielded under the pressure exerted by a hammer or the way it danced to the rhythm of a welder — it was like an elegant, well-choreographed ballet of construction and creation. The sparks that flew whenever metal kissed metal under force was like watching fireworks. The sound of whirring machines and metal scraping against metal was not just noise; it was melody, to him. In contrast to his connection with metal, wood was a constant struggle for him. It is not that he could not appreciate the warmth and organic beauty that wood exuded, but the material simply did not resonate with his creative faculties. Where he could see multiple possibilities with a slab of metal, a piece of wood would only seem like a dead-end street. Wood seemed capricious to him. It splintered easily, warped under heat, contracted and expanded with changes in weather, and was susceptible to termites and rot. Even the tools and techniques required for woodworking were vastly different than those used in metalworking. Hammers and welders had to be exchanged for saws and varnishes. The risks associated with woodworking, such as the risk of splinters, cuts, or developing allergies to certain types of wood dust, also made the process unappealing to him. There was a lack of predictability with wood that he was not comfortable with, and he found it almost impossible to enforce his will on the material without it pushing back with warped surfaces or stubborn grains. On the other hand, metal, in its unforgiving hardness and resistance, allowed him absolute control while delivering outcomes that were precise and predictable. In the end, it was about personal preference and inherent strengths. Some might argue about the environmental considerations associated with using one material over the other, and those are undoubtedly important. However, when it came to the act of creating, he found the process of working with metal undeniably more rewarding and liberating than wood. Working with metal, he could deliver designs that were not only functional and durable, but also reflected his technical prowess and artistic creativity. And that was what made metal intuitive to him."},{"prompt":"Kendall had a birthday party at work and had a cake. Given the context: What will Others want to do next?

Background: Emilie Autumn Liddell (born on September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, violinist, and actress. Autumn's musical style has been described by her as \\"Fairy Pop\\", \\"Fantasy Rock\\" or \\"Victoriandustrial\\". It is influenced by glam rock and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backup dancers Context: As part of a recording project, Autumn traveled to Chicago, Illinois, in 2001, and decided to stay because she enjoyed the public transportation system and music scene there. She released the 2001 EP Chambermaid while finishing Enchant--she alternatively labeled the musical style on Chambermaid as \\"fantasy rock\\" and cabaret--and wrote the 2001 charity single \\"By the Sword\\" after the events of September 11, 2001. According to her, the song is about strength, not violence; the act of swearing by the sword represents \\"an unbreakable promise to right a wrong, to stay true\\". On February 26, 2003, she released her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: \\"new-age, pop and trip hop chamber music\\". Written during her late teenage years, Enchant revolved around the supernatural realm and its effect on the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as \\"fantasy rock\\", which dealt with \\"dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite your head off if you dare to touch them\\". The faery-themed \\"Enchant Puzzle\\" appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. Her bandmates consisted of cellist Joey Harvey, drummer Heath Jansen, guitarist Ben Lehl, and bassist Jimmy Vanaria, who also worked on the electronics. At the same time of Enchant's release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, \\"a classical baroque ensemble\\" that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks--a woman executed for witchcraft. On the night of the Enchant release party, Autumn learned that Courtney Love had invited her to record an album, America's Sweetheart, and embark on the tour to promote it. Contributing violin and vocals, Autumn appeared in Love's backing band The Chelsea--Radio Sloan, Dvin Kirakosian, Samantha Maloney, and Lisa Leveridge--on the 2004 tour. Much of Autumn's violin work did not get released on the album; she commented: \\"This had to do entirely with new producers taking over the project after our little vacation in France, and carefully discarding all of our sessions.\\" She performed live with Love and The Chelsea on Late Show with David Letterman on March 17, 2004, and at Bowery Ballroom the next day. In September 2004, her father died from lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking twenty years earlier. Near the end of 2004, she was filmed for an appearance on an episode of HGTV's Crafters Coast to Coast, showing viewers how to create faery wings and sushi-styled soap--both products she sold in her online \\"web design and couture fashion house\\", WillowTech House. On December 23, 2004, she appeared on the Chicago-based television station WGN as part of the string quartet backing up Billy Corgan and Dennis DeYoung's duet of \\"We Three Kings\\".

Of all the developments of Institute week, naturally the one which filled J.W.'s thoughts with a sort of awed gladness was Marty's decision to offer himself for the ministry. Joe Carbrook's right-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision was made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a preacher. It was as fit as you please. As to Joe, previous opinion had been pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might make a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer. In the light of the Institute happenings, it was to be expected that the question of college would promptly become a practical matter to four Delafield people. Marty was greatly troubled, for he knew if he was to be a preacher, he must go to college, and he couldn't see how. J.W. felt no great urge, though it had always been understood that he would go.

Movie title: The Hunted Movie plot: Paul Racine, a computer-chip executive from New York, is on a business trip to Nagoya. He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Mieko explains the history of the two clans' conflict and the samurai concepts of courage and honor. Mieko is sympathetic toward Paul, the polar opposite of her husband, although she remains loyal to Takeda. Kinjo decides to find out who hired his clan to murder Kirina....

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Two geology students had an exam on plate tectonics. Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. Hint: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. Answer:","completion":"Bobby knew more about seafloor spreading.

The frontman's brooding charisma - added to the group's blend of rap, metal and electronic music - spawned a string of chart-topping hits. The son of a police officer in Phoenix, Arizona, Bennington was born on 20 March 1976 and had a troubled youth. After years of intense drug use, he got sober and joined Linkin Park in 1998. \\"Growing up, for me, was very scary and very lonely,\\" he told Metal Hammer magazine in 2014. \\"I started getting molested when I was about seven or eight,\\" he said, describing the abuser as an older friend. \\"I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didn't want to do. \\"It destroyed my self-confidence. Like most people, I was too afraid to say anything. \\"I didn't want people to think I was gay or that I was lying. It was a horrible experience,\\" he told the magazine. His parents divorced when he was 11 years old, and he went to live with his father, whom he described as \\"not emotionally very stable then\\", adding that \\"there was no-one I could turn to\\". The singer quit hard drugs after a gang broke into a property where the future star was getting high and pistol-whipped some of his friends. Bennington moved to Los Angeles and successfully auditioned to join Linkin Park. Later in the 2000s, as the band's success took off, he again began using drugs before returning to sobriety, telling Spin Magazine in 2009: \\"It's not cool to be an alcoholic. \\"It's not cool to go drink and be a dumbass. \\"It's cool to be a part of recovery. \\"Most of my work has been a reflection of what I've been going through in one way or another,\\" he added. Formed in 1996, Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory surfed the popular wave of nu-metal, Rolling Stone magazine writes. It eventually sold more than 30 million albums and became one of the top-selling albums since the start of this millennium. The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. Linkin Park had a string of hits including Faint, In The End and Crawling, and collaborated with rapper Jay-Z. Their latest music video for the song Talking to Myself was released on Thursday, on the same day of the artist's death. Bennington was said to be close to Sound Garden's Chris Cornell, who took his own life in May 2017. Bennington sang at the funeral for Cornell, who would have turned 53 on Thursday. In addition to working with Linkin Park, he also sang for Stone Temple Pilots, for his side project Dead by Sunrise, and Kings of Chaos.

It’s official: GE is open for business in Boston Say goodbye to the free parking, big offices, and corporate cafeteria. Say hello to the MBTA, standing desks, and more restaurants within walking distance than you can count. About 175 General Electric Co. employees traded the Merritt Parkway for the Mass. Pike on Monday as the industrial giant formally established Boston as its headquarters city. Many more employees, however, are staying back in Connecticut. Spokeswoman Sue Bishop said nearly 600 people at the company’s sprawling Fairfield campus are instead moving to an office in nearby Norwalk in waves through the end of October. GE has put the 67-acre Fairfield property up for sale. Governor Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh joined GE chief executive Jeff Immelt to welcome employees at the new offices at 33-41 Farnsworth St. in South Boston’s Fort Point section on Monday. This is just an interim step: The company is in the midst of pushing designs for a three-building campus off nearby Necco Court through the city’s permitting process and expects to move there in 2018. In the meantime, the executives who moved to Boston will have to squeeze into a much smaller headquarters. The two buildings at GE’s Fairfield campus totaled 495,000 square feet. But here on Farnsworth, GE will only occupy about 66,000 square feet over several floors, Bishop said, and about one-third of that space is still being renovated. The closeness of the quarters is intentional. Immelt told employees on Monday that he wants them to do things differently — a reference to his efforts to prod workers to move more quickly, to collaborate more with outside players. “It’s not just a physical move,” Bishop said. “The intention is to use some of the physical space to drive a cultural change.” Bishop said GE will likely employ 300 to 350 people in the Farnsworth Street space by the end of the year — a group that will include about 100 people from Current, GE’s new lighting and energy division, as well as software developers who work with GE’s digital arm. Much of the space had most recently been occupied by software firm Bullhorn, which decamped for the Financial District this year. GE expects to increase that number to 800 by the end of 2018, assuming its new headquarters opens as planned that year. GE will first occupy two old brick buildings there after they are renovated, while a new structure will be built that will overlook the Fort Point Channel. Combined, the space in the three buildings will total about 390,000 square feet over two acres. To help persuade GE to pick Boston for its new headquarters in January, the Baker administration offered as much as 120 million in state infrastructure grant funds for the new Necco Court complex. City officials, meanwhile, promised up to 25 million in property tax relief over 20 years. City and state officials also offered “concierge relocation services,” including a “City Hall To Go” truck to help provide government services for GE employees such as transit passes and municipal parking permits. GE hadn’t yet arranged for the truck’s arrival, Bishop said, but the company still plans to take the local officials up on that offer. What was this article about?","completion":"This article covers General Electric Co.'s (GE) official move to Boston from its previous location. Around 175 of GE's employees made the transition, relocating from the former spacious corporate environment to a much smaller and currently partially renovated headquarters at Farnsworth Street. This is a temporary location while renovations for a new three-building campus are being finalized, with a planned relocation in 2018. The goal of the move is not just physical but also strategic, with the smaller spaces intended to encourage more collaboration and quicker pace of work. GE expects to house between 300 and 350 employees at the temporary location by the end of the year and aims to increase that number to 800 once the new headquarters open, with the total space amounting to about 390,000 square feet over two acres. To facilitate this shift, the Baker administration offered significant financial incentives and relocation services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Barbara and Jane are two students. They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere. Hint: The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height. Answer:","completion":"Jane learned more about temperature inversion. Although both Barbara and Jane study meteorology, the paragraph provides information about the process that leads to temperature inversion in the stratosphere. This is more closely related to Jane's studies of the stratosphere, rather than Barbara's studies focused on the formation of the ozone layer."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over.

Notice that on both sides of the equation, the variable j is multiplied with a constants (869 and 877). If both sides are equal, then either both constants must be equal, which is not the case here, or the variable j must be equal to zero to cancel out the effect of the differing constants. Let's go ahead and eliminate the common factor j from both sides of the equation: Divide both sides by j (assuming j ≠ 0): (869 * j) / j = (877 * j) / j This simplifies to: 869 = 877 Since we know that 869 ≠ 877, it means that our assumption that j ≠ 0 must be incorrect and that j must be equal to zero.

It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket.

The sentence comprises of three key words: 1. \\"Was n't\\" - This is a contraction for \\"was not\\" and implies a negative statement in the past. 2. \\"Just\\" - It is used to intensify or emphasize the meaning of the preceding word, which in this case is \\"bad.\\" 3. \\"Bad\\" - This word is a negative adjective describing the quality or nature of a subject. By looking at the structure of the sentence, the use of the word \\"bad\\" conveys negativity, and the inclusion of the word \\"just\\" emphasizes this negativity further. The statement is being intensified to convey that the subject (in this case, the movie) had more issues than simply being \\"bad.\\" The negative implications of \\"was not\\" further contribute to the overall negative sentiment.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was said to be making the church a popular meeting place on campus for undergraduates? , can you please find it? Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes. Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion. In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion. By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \\"enormous success\\".In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War. Leading this focus was Stanford Memorial Church Dean of the Chapel and Professor of Religion B. Davie Napier, who was \\"a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam\\". Napier, along with Stanford professors Michael Novak and Robert McAfee Brown, who had previously been faculty members of seminaries, were the subject of a Time Magazine article in 1966, describing \\"the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford\\". Students crowded into the church to hear anti-war speeches by them, as well as by \\"notables\\" such as Linus Pauling and William Sloan Coffin.

A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

The menu descriptions were enticing, making it nearly impossible to decide which dish to choose. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable and provided excellent recommendations based on our individual taste preferences. For appetizers, we decided on the fried calamari and bruschetta - both of which were heavenly. The calamari was lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection, boasting a delicate balance of crispy exterior and tender meat inside. The bruschetta, topped with juicy tomatoes, basil, garlic and fresh mozzarella, was a mouthwatering delight bursting with flavor. For our entrees, I ordered the pan-seared salmon with lemon-caper sauce, accompanied by asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. Words cannot describe how delectable this dish was. The salmon was tender, flaky, and expertly seasoned, while the lemon-caper sauce added a refreshing tang that elevated the dish to a whole new level! Next to me, a friend relished their perfectly cooked and juicy steak, and another raved about their bright and flavorful pasta dish. In an effort to extend this incredible dining experience, we agreed to indulge in their dessert offerings. We shared a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a slice of their signature tiramisu. The chocolate lava cake was velvety and rich, and it paired beautifully with the cool, creamy ice cream. As for the tiramisu, it was incredibly light and boasted the perfect balance of coffee and sweet flavors. To top off this exceptional meal, the service was impeccable throughout the evening. Our server continuously checked in on us but was never intrusive, always ensuring that our glasses were full, and each course arrived on time.

Ward, who drove her car head-on into freeway traffic in an alleged suicide attempt has been charged with the second-degree murder of a driver she struck, authorities said Thursday. REDDING, Calif. -- A Northern California woman who drove her car head-on into freeway traffic in an alleged suicide attempt has been charged with the second-degree murder of a driver she struck, authorities said Thursday. Grace Elizabeth Ward, 28, suffered a broken leg in the accident that killed Ryan Folsom, a former football player at Brigham Young University, on Interstate 5 earlier this month. The Red Bluff woman was arrested Tuesday after her release from the hospital and remained jailed on 1.5 million bail. A public defender was expected to be appointed to her case at her scheduled arraignment on Friday, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. Folsom, 29, was from Medford, Oregon, and attended medical school in San Antonio, Texas. On Jan. 7, he was heading to a hospital in Sacramento to interview for a residency when Ward struck his car. Ward was driving north on the freeway in Redding when she crossed into oncoming traffic in an alleged attempt to kill herself by running into other cars, Bridgett said. \\"She intentionally was driving and swerving towards them,\\" Bridgett said. Three cars were able to swerve out of the way before Folsom's car was struck, Bridgett said. The district attorney said Ward made a \\"selfish\\" decision that met the legal requirements of second-degree murder. Ryan Folsom was killed on Interstate 5 earlier this month in California. GoFundMe \\"She made a choice, a purposeful choice to use her vehicle and driving in a fashion that was reckless and dangerous with a complete disregard\\" for other lives, Bridgett said. Folsom was a running back at BYU in Utah, where he studied neuroscience, and attended the University of Texas medical school in San Antonio. Ward has been interviewed but Bridgett declined to discuss what she told investigators. The district attorney also declined to discuss details of Ward's background. In addition to the murder charge, Ward is charged with three counts of attempted murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly trying to strike the other three cars, Bridgett said. She also is charged with felony vandalism for damaging a median strip in trying to cross into oncoming traffic, Bridgett said. Ward could face life in prison if convicted. Folsom's widow is pregnant with their third child. A GoFundMe account raised more than 300,000 for the family. ||||| CLOSE Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett explains how a crash that killed a 29-year-old aspiring doctor unfolded earlier this month -- and why she decided to charge the alleged suspect with murder and three counts of attempted murder.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years passed between the two Crimean campaigns?","completion":"Title: The Passage of Time: Years Between the Two Crimean Campaigns Introduction: When we talk about the Crimean campaigns, we usually refer to two significant events in history: the Crimean War of 1853-1856 and the Crimean Crisis in 2014. This article will delve into the differences between the two campaigns, the historical context behind each incident, and calculate the number of years that passed between these two significant landmarks in global affairs. The First Crimean Campaign - The Crimean War: The Crimean War took place between 1853 and 1856. It was a military conflict that involved an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, Britain, France, and Sardinia, against the Russian Empire. The primary cause of war was a dispute between the Christian religious groups seeking control over the holy sites in Palestine, which was under Ottoman control. However, it also served to check Russia's expansionist objectives in the Black Sea region. The war saw major battles in the Crimean Peninsula, such as the Siege of Sevastopol, and the Battle of Balaclava, famously known for the Charge of the Light Brigade. The war ended in 1856 with the Treaty of Paris, which sought to curb Russian influence in the Black Sea area, protect the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, and maintain the regional balance of power among the European nations. The Second Crimean Campaign - The Crimean Crisis: The Crimean Crisis took place in 2014, with Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. This event caused alarm and widespread condemnation from the global community, as Russia had violated Ukraine's sovereignty and international law. The pretext for Russia's intervention was to protect the Russian-speaking population in Crimea, following the ongoing political turmoil in Ukraine that escalated in February 2014. Russia's annexation of Crimea has led to numerous negative consequences for the region, as it exacerbated the ongoing war in Eastern Ukraine, prompted a series of economic sanctions from the West on Russia, and sparked geopolitical tensions reminiscent of the Cold War era. Calculating the Years Between the Two Crimean Campaigns: To calculate the number of years between the two campaigns, we need to find the difference between the years in which each campaign ended. The Crimean War ended in 1856, while the Crimean Crisis occurred in 2014. Years Between = 2014 - 1856 Years Between = 158 Conclusion: The two Crimean campaigns discussed in this article are separated by 158 years. These events offer two different perspectives from separate eras: the first reflecting the power struggles and diplomacy of the 19th century, and the second demonstrating the modern geopolitical tensions affecting the region currently.

In this sentence, it is being stated that the man is worth his ego, meaning he has a strong sense of self-worth and that it matches his actual value. Sentence 2: That man is not worth as much as he thinks he is. In this sentence, it is being stated that the man overestimates his worth; he believes he is worth more than his actual value. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between both sentences: We must determine if Sentence 1, being true, proves that Sentence 2 is also true. Step 3: Compare the claims made in both sentences: Sentence 1 claims that the man's worth matches his ego. Sentence 2 claims that the man's worth is less than he perceives it to be. Step 4: Determine the truth of Sentence 2 based on the assumption that Sentence 1 is true: If Sentence 1 is true, then the man's ego accurately reflects his worth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. They are worried about the future of the snow leopard's habitat if common leopards begin to live at higher elevations in a warming climate. The issue will be high on the agenda of an international meeting involving 12 snow leopard range countries starting in Nepal on Tuesday, 17 January. The video was recently obtained from a camera trap in Qinghai province in China. It shows both cats at the same location in July 2016. Wildlife experts say this is the first pictorial evidence of the two cats at the same place. The snow leopard is an endangered species. One of the video clips from the camera trap shows a female common leopard with a cub. This has made researchers think that the animal was not simply visiting the area but was actually living there. Snow leopards live at an altitude above 3,000m in typically open and rocky areas. Common leopards' habitats include forests and woodlands at lower elevations. Snow leopards are sparsely distributed across 12 countries - Mongolia and the Himalayan ranges in China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan, as well as in the five Central Asian states. There are an estimated 3,500 to 7,000 snow leopards in the wild and they have been listed as endangered mainly because of poaching and habitat loss. Scientists say the lower reaches of snow leopard's habitats and the upper limits of common leopards' territories have always overlapped in the Himalayas and other high mountains in Asia. But, they add, climate change could make that more complicated. \\"In a changing climate, we expect the tree line to move up the slopes and that's encroaching into the snow leopard's habitat,\\" said Byron Weckworth, China programme director with Panthera, a conservation organisation dedicated to preserving wild cats. Some studies have shown that the upper forest tree line is already being pushed higher. They suggest that between 30% and 50% of the current snow leopard habitat in the Himalayas will be lost because of the shifting tree line and the shrinking of the alpine zone. \\"The bigger threat is the snow leopards' habitat loss and its fragmentation,\\" said Mr Weckworth, whose organisation has partnered with the Snow Leopard Trust and Chinese conservation organisation Shan Shui to monitor wildlife in China's Sanjiangyuan nature reserve. Prof Sandro Lovari, from the University of Siena in Italy, was not involved in this research but has conducted separate studies on snow leopards. He agrees with the loss of habitat projections. \\"Snow leopards could be squeezed between the barren land of the higher parts of the mountain and the upward moving tree line,\\" he said. Wen Cheng from Shan Shui says the availability of food will be key. \\"The possibility for co-existence or conflict highly depends on the abundance and diversity of wild prey,\\" he said. Prof Lovari's team conducted a study on snow leopards in the Sagarmatha National park in Nepal's Everest region in 2013. They found that the common leopard had a greater habitat adaptability. \\"This behaviour could enhance the [common leopard's] takeover of the snow leopard's habitat as it's the larger, more ecologically flexible species,\\" Prof Lovari explained. In Nepal's Annapurna and Kanchanjunga conservation areas too, common leopards have been recently found in altitudes that normally have been the territories of snow leopards. Koustubh Sharma, an expert with the Snow Leopard Trust, said: \\"How are these two cat species already managing to live together - or will the interface be difficult when their habitats are changing with climate change?\\" \\"The pictures from our camera trap make these questions more relevant and pressing.\\" While some conservationists fear that there might be conflicts between the two leopard species for habitat and prey, others think the two already co-exist in places where their territories overlap. Mr Weckworth said their research team in China found locals believing that the two species could even mate. \\"The common leopards there are more pale in colour and that may have sparked that kind of perception among locals. But from a biological point of view, it's extremely unlikely that they can hybridise,\\" Mr Weckworth of the Panthera organisation added. During his field study in Nepal's Sagarmatha National Park, Prof Lovari said he found male snow leopards coming down to the edge of the forested land during the mating period. \\"But there is no information whatsoever on the hybridisation between common and snow leopards,\\" he said. \\"It would be very unlikely - even more unlikely than brown bears and polar bears.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about how experts are worried about the future of snow leopards' homes if common leopards start living higher up in mountains because of a warmer climate. They found a video that shows both cats in the same place and think that the common leopard was actually living there. Snow leopards' homes are being lost because of things like trees growing higher up the slopes and people taking their land. This could cause problems between the two leopard species as they might compete for space and food. Some people think they might already be able to live together, but others are not so sure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"The Heidelberg Dance of Death, also known as \\"Der Heidelberger Totentanz,\\" is a magnificent example of a medieval artistic tradition that aimed to remind audiences of the universality of death and the fleeting nature of earthly life. These illustrations are deeply rooted in historical and artistic contexts, and each picture represents a different \\"dancer\\" or character involved in the dance of death. Originating in the 15th century, the Heidelberg Dance of Death is part of a larger European tradition, including other famous examples like the \\"Dance Macabre\\" in France or the \\"Danse Macabre\\" in Italy. In these dances, death is personified as a skeletal figure leading representatives of various social classes and professions in a procession. The Heidelberg Dance of Death is a German adaptation of this tradition, and the illustrations are housed in the University Library of Heidelberg, Germany. Each illustration in this collection showcases a unique dancer, symbolizing different social classes and professions entwined in the dance of death. Some of the dancers include: 1. The Pope: Symbolizing the highest religious authority in the Catholic Church, the Pope is led by death in the dance, emphasizing that even the most powerful religious figures cannot escape their mortality. 2. The Emperor: Representing secular power, the Emperor is reminded by death that even the most influential rulers are ultimately subject to the same fate as everyone else. 3. The Nobleman: Showcasing the aristocracy, the Nobleman is a reminder that wealth and status cannot save one from death's inevitable embrace. 4. The Merchant: Demonstrating the importance of trade and commerce in medieval society, the Merchant serves as a warning that material possessions and economic success do not ensure a reprieve from death. 5. The Farmer: Depicting the backbone of the medieval economy, the Farmer represents the common people and their inability to escape the final dance with death. 6. The Maiden: Symbolizing innocence and beauty, the Maiden's involvement in the dance illustrates that youth and grace do not guarantee immunity from mortality. 7. The Beggar: Standing for the lowest rung of society, the Beggar serves as a reminder that even the most downtrodden and impoverished cannot evade death's cold grasp. 8. The Child: Representing the innocence and vulnerability of children, the Child's embrace by death underscores the indiscriminate nature of mortality that transcends age and circumstance. By removing spaces between words in these descriptions, a continuous narrative is formed, one that emphasizes the relentless march of life and death: ThePopeTakesPartInTheDanceOfDeathWithTheEmperorNoblemanMerchantFarmerMaidenBeggarAndChild. This long, uninterrupted string of words seems to mimic the unceasing cycle of life and death that binds all humanity together irrespective of their social standing, wealth, or profession. In conclusion, the Heidelberg Dance of Death's illustrations depict a variety of dancers from diverse social classes, professions, and circumstances, all participating in the inescapable dance with death. Through these images, the artists aimed to remind viewers of the fleeting nature of human life and the universality of death, no matter one's position or achievements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

Question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Article: Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise. Question: What is extra-pair copulation?","completion":"Extra-pair copulation (EPC) refers to the act of mating that occurs between two individuals of a bird species, despite one or both being involved in a socially monogamous partnership with another bird. Socially monogamous bird species are those where a male and female pair up for at least the breeding season or sometimes even longer, continuing until the death of one mate. Despite the monogamous bond, extra-pair copulations can still take place for various reasons and are quite common in many species. Usually, EPC is observed in scenarios where dominant males mate with females that are partnered with subordinate males. It may also result from forced copulation in certain species like ducks and other anatids. Female birds possess sperm storage mechanisms that allow the sperm from different males to remain viable for extended periods, sometimes up to a hundred days, leading to sperm competition between males. There are potential benefits for both males and females involved in extra-pair copulations. For females, engaging in EPC may result in stronger, healthier offspring due to better genes being introduced from the dominant males, as well as providing insurance against possible infertility in their primary mate. On the other hand, males participating in EPC are likely to have the opportunity to sire additional offspring, thus improving their chances of passing on their genes. Male birds that belong to species experiencing high rates of extra-pair copulations often exhibit guarding behaviors to ensure the parentage of any offspring that they raise. This protective action helps the male ensure that they are investing their resources and efforts into rearing their own offspring and not another male's progeny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Were there more bald eagles in 1980 or in 1992?","completion":"Title: The Unraveling Tale of the Bald Eagle: A Journey from 1980 to 1992 Introduction The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a symbol of freedom and America's national bird, holds an interesting yet tumultuous history when it comes to its population status. This powerful raptor, known for its majestic appearance, experienced significant fluctuations in numbers throughout the twentieth century. This article will explore the population of bald eagles in two distinct time periods, 1980 and 1992, to determine where the species had more abundant populations. Background Before diving deep into the comparison of bald eagle populations in 1980 and 1992, it is crucial to understand the factors that influenced the species' conservation status during this time. Bald eagles were once thriving and widespread throughout North America, numbering nearly half a million before European settlement. However, by the mid-twentieth century, their populations suffered drastic declines primarily due to habitat loss, hunting, and the devastating effects of the insecticide, DDT. DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) became widely used in the United States during the 1940s to combat malaria and control pests. It accumulated in the fatty tissues of organisms, including fish, the primary food source for the bald eagles. As a result, DDT would concentrate in their bodies, leading to weakened eggshells and disrupted reproductive success. In 1963, there were only 417 documented nesting pairs of bald eagles in the contiguous United States, which resulted in the species being added to the endangered species list. Taking notice of their rapid decline, several federal and state-led conservation initiatives were implemented to protect and restore the bald eagle population. In 1972, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of DDT, and in 1973, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed to protect the species and its habitat. These conservation measures were pivotal in reviving the bald eagle populations, setting the stage for the species' slow but steady resurgence. Comparison: Bald Eagle Population in 1980 vs. 1992 By 1980, almost a decade after the DDT ban and the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, bald eagles had begun their arduous recovery. Nevertheless, populations were still not stabilized. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) records, there were approximately 1,550 nesting pairs in the contiguous United States in that year. Successful breeding and nesting were observed in several states, though still a far cry from the healthy population levels of pre-DDT era. Within the subsequent 12 years, bald eagles experienced significant progress as conservation efforts continued to unfold. FWS reports reveal that by 1992, the number of nesting pairs had risen to approximately 4,450 in the contiguous United States. Furthermore, the species reestablished itself in numerous states across the nation. This remarkable increase was a testament to the tireless endeavors of conservationists, federal, and state agencies that sought to ensure the survival of the bald eagle. Several factors contributed to the population growth in those 12 years, including: 1. The DDT ban, which led to the gradual recovery of affected ecosystems. 2. Legal protection afforded by the Endangered Species Act. 3. Conservation programs that actively monitored and protected bald eagle nests. 4. Restoration of vital habitats, like wetlands, for nesting and hunting. 5. Public awareness campaigns that raised consciousness about the plight of the bald eagle. Conclusion By contrasting the bald eagle population numbers in 1980 and 1992, it becomes evident that there were significantly more of these majestic birds in 1992. The combined impact of numerous conservation efforts, such as the banning of DDT, legal protection, habitat restoration, and increased public awareness, and the tireless efforts of various stakeholders fueled the recovery of this iconic species. The bald eagle's journey is indeed a prime example of the power of conservation and proof that it is possible to reverse the tragic decline of a species through dedication, collaboration, and determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which project would register higher CPU load, project A or project C? Answer:","completion":"Project C would register a higher CPU load compared to project A. The reason behind this is twofold: 1. Data Volume: Project A has a smaller volume of XML data compared to Project C, which has a large volume of data. Processing larger volumes of XML data requires more CPU resources to parse and manipulate the files, resulting in higher CPU load for project C. 2. Encoding Format: In Project B, Bob applied the Fast Infoset format, which is a binary encoding format specifically designed to optimize XML processing (i.e., faster parsing and less memory usage). However, this format was not applied in Project C, which means that Project C is still using the regular, less efficient XML format. As a result, processing the large volume of data in Project C is more resource-intensive, leading to a higher CPU load compared to project A, which has a smaller volume of data. In summary, Project C would register a higher CPU load than Project A due to the combination of larger data volume and less efficient data encoding format."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the last names of the two people the advance scout troop of 90 men were under? By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner.

In Spanish, the adjective (new) typically follows the noun (server). - Provides: \\"Proporciona\\". This is the 3rd person singular present tense of the verb 'proporcionar', which means 'to provide'. - RADIUS-client-enabled devices: \\"Dispositivos habilitados para el cliente RADIUS\\". - With centralized: \\"Con centralizada\\". The preposition 'con' translates to 'with' in English. Also, the adjective is placed before the noun in Spanish. - Account management and authentication: \\"Administración de cuentas y autenticación\\". 'And' translates to 'y' in Spanish. - For network access: \\"Para el acceso a la red\\". 'For' can translate to 'para' or 'por' depending on the context. It is 'para' in this context as it shows purpose. 'A' is the preposition for 'to', and 'la red' is 'the network'.

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. and the situation: Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school.

President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said.

This enthusiasm is, in part, driven by opposition to President Trump and his policies, as evidenced by the exit polls showing that anger at Trump was a significant factor motivating Democratic voters to go to the polls. Peoples suggests that these election results can be seen as a repudiation of the Trump nationalist message and a warning sign for Republicans as they head into the 2018 midterm elections. The Democratic wins in these races, along with the gains in state delegate seats in Virginia, demonstrate the potential for Democrats to capitalize on this grassroots energy in races for lower-level offices across the country.

Which entity is this text about? Luzzatti was born of Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. Appointed minister of the treasury in the first Di Rudini cabinet of 1891, he imprudently abolished the system of frequent clearings of banknotes between the state banks, a measure which facilitated the duplication of part of the paper currency and hastened the bank crisis of 1893 and the resulting Banca Romana scandal. A Parliamentary Commission that investigated the bank scandal concluded that former Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, and Luzzatti, had been aware of the conditions of the Banca Romana but had held back that information. In 1896 he entered the second Di Rudini cabinet as minister of the treasury, and by timely legislation helped to save the bank of Naples from failure. Following the revolt and suppression of the Fasci Siciliani (1891-1894), Luzzatti introduced two measures of social legislation in 1898. The industrial workmen's compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created. After his fall from office in June 1898, his principal achievement was the negotiation of the Franco-Italian commercial treaty, though, as deputy, journalist and professor, he continued to take an active part in all political and economic manifestations. He was again minister of the treasury from November 1903 to March 1905 in Giolitti's second administration, and for the third time from February to May 1906, under Sonnino's premiership. During the latter term of office he achieved the conversion of the Italian 5% debt (reduced to 4% by the tax) to 3 3/4 % to be eventually lowered to 3 1/2 %, an operation which other ministers had attempted without success; although the actual conversion was not completed until after the fall of the cabinet of which he formed part the merit is entirely his. In 1907 he was president of the co-operative congress at Cremona.","completion":"This text is about Luzzatti, an Italian economist, politician, and social reformer who was born on March 11, 1841.

But one RBS advisor launched her own bank delivery service when she travelled to a war veteran's home during her lunchbreak to help him following a break-in. Louis Butler, 92, said Victoria Mowbray had restored his 'faith in human nature' by going the extra mile after burglars stole hundreds of pounds in cash from his home. Louis Butler said his 'faith in human nature' was restored by bank worker Victoria Mowbray who went to his aid when he rang to cancel his cards after his home was burgled. When Mr Butler rang RBS customer services to cancel his stolen bank cards Ms Mowbray was so touched by his tale she drove the two miles to his home and rang bank colleagues and even the police on his behalf. Mr Butler, who was honoured personally by King George VI for flying Lancaster Bombers during the war, said: 'The lady at the bank was great and she has restored my faith in human nature. 'She cancelled my missing bank cards and phoned the police for me so I could report the crime. She even called my daughter Angela to tell her what happened. She helped me with everything. 'It just shows the bank can help customers where it matters. I was dreading getting through to a call centre in India but to get through to someone working up the road was like a breath of fresh air. 'For her to then come over and help me was above and beyond the call of duty. I just wish more banks could operate like this when their customers need them.' Widower Mr Butler was asleep when. burglars broke into his home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester. and grabbed £300 in cash, his laptop, his passport and other important. identification and information.

'When I told her what had happened the lady just dropped everything and came straight round to my home in her car to help me cancel my cards. I was amazed. She is so helpful. I can't thank her enough.'

Ms Mowbray, who works in the Shaw branch in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: 'I don't think I have done anything special. 'When he rang the bank, I didn't even know if he was a customer of ours or not. He was saying he was a 92-year-old man and he had been robbed.

Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly positive. From the very beginning of the review, it is clear that the user has a strong appreciation for the album. The title \\"A Timeless Delight...\\" suggests that the album has a timeless and enjoyable quality, which sets a positive tone for the review. The user goes on to describe the album as their \\"favorite pop-rock/alternative album of the 90's,\\" which implies that it holds a special place in their heart and that they find it superior to other albums they enjoyed during that decade. Furthermore, the reviewer praises the quality of every single song on the album, even going so far as to use emphatic language (e.g., \\"so dam* good\\") to underscore the level of enjoyment they derived from the music. The reviewer also includes the fact that five songs from the album were played on the radio and reached the top 10 charts. This fact not only reinforces the positive tone of the review, but it also provides objective evidence to support the reviewer's personal views on the album's quality. Additionally, the reviewer expresses a sense that the album's lesser-known tracks are even better than those that received radio play, describing them as \\"the best tracks.\\" This suggests a high level of engagement with the album and implies that the reviewer has listened to it extensively enough to form an opinion on the relative quality of its various tracks. The fact that the user enjoys the lesser-known tracks even more than the hits strengthens the positive tone of the review. The only potential negative aspect of the review comes in the form of a qualified \\"negative\\" – that is, a negative observation presented as an amusing or ironic twist. When the reviewer says, \\"The funny thing is that the rest of the tracks that weren't released are the best tracks,\\" they might be hinting at some disappointment that these tracks weren't given the same level of exposure as the radio hits. Nonetheless, even this observation ultimately serves to emphasize how highly the user regards the album as a whole. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer providing an effusive endorsement of the album's merits and attesting to its enduring appeal. While there may be a hint of ironic disappointment regarding the lesser-known tracks' lack of exposure, this does not detract from the overall enthusiastic praise for the album."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Romanian:","completion":"Domnule Președinte, doamnelor și domnilor, tocmai evenimentele care au loc la cel mai scăzut nivel, la nivel provincial în Italia, reprezintă cea mai mare demonstrație de libertate a presei și a informației: gândiți-vă la toate ziarele locale, la publicațiile orașelor, mari și mici, pe care oamenii le citesc în fiecare zi și vedeți despre cine vorbesc! Această demonstrație de libertate a informației include o varietate largă de opinii, idei și perspective care sunt prezentate publicului în mod deschis și transparent. Faptul că oamenii pot să citească zilnic aceste informații și să fie în cunoștință de cauză despre evenimentele cruciale care au loc în comunitatea lor, într-adevăr reflectă angajamentul Italiei pentru democrație și libertatea presei. Existența ziarelor locale și a publicațiilor orașelor în Italia demonstrează cum mass-media independentă este capabilă să promoveze și să protejeze valorile și instituțiile democratice fundamentale ale țării. Aceste publicații aduc în lumina reflectoarelor problemele și preocupările comunităților la nivel local, ajutând la construirea unor punți de comunicare între cetățeni și autoritățile politice și administrative. De asemenea, revistele locale și regionale în Italia oferă platforma necesară pentru ca jurnaliștii experimentați și cei aflați la început de carieră să-și dezvolte abilitățile, să-și dezvolte onestitatea și integritatea profesională și să promoveze un sistem de control prin intermediul mass-media care poate sesiza și critica abaterile sau neregulile din sistemele politice și administrative. Libertatea presei și accesul la informații în Italia, în special în rândul publicațiilor locale, oferă o lecție importantă despre posibilitatea ca mass-media să funcționeze într-un mod responsabil, informativ și transparent, contribuind la dezvoltarea unei societăți democratice și sănătoase în care drepturile și interesele cetățenilor sunt respectate și apărate. Prin urmare, evenimentele de la nivel provincial în Italia și prevalența ziarelor locale și a publicațiilor orașelor demonstrează puterea democrației și a libertății presei, și reprezintă un exemplu remarcabil pentru alte țări din întreaga lume că împuternicirea cetățenilor și sprijinirea unei prese responsabile și oneste poate aduce o creștere semnificativă a transparenței, a responsabilității și a justiției sociale."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave.

Behind Mr Obama in the men's poll were former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who gained three and two per cent of the vote, respectively. The evangelical Christian Reverend Billy Graham was fourth. Americans' support for Mr Obama hit an all-time low in October when he was given a 38 per cent approval rating. It has since risen to 47 per cent but it remains a far cry from the 69 per cent approval rating he gained when he first came to office three years ago. Seal of approval: US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been named the most admired woman for the tenth year in a row.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It's every African-American parent's nightmare: seeing your son being led away in handcuffs when you know he's done nothing wrong. The surreal scene happened to me one recent morning. While sitting in my backyard I heard adult male voices around the side of the house. I opened the gate and saw a white police officer handcuffing my 13-year-old son. The plainclothes Evanston, Illinois, officer and his partner did not identify themselves as police. They did not ask our son's age or where he lived. They told him first to put his hands up and then handcuffed him. They assumed he was guilty, of what we didn't know. His crime appeared to be that he was a black male. Later, we would listen to the 911 tape of what preceded the incident. It was apparent police had targeted my son while he was riding his bike home from a friend's house. Why? According to officers, he fit the description of a burglary suspect who had allegedly entered a nearby home. The description they offered: a black male wearing cargo shorts. Our son was wearing cargo shorts, but that identification could have applied to hundreds of black males in Evanston on that particular day. Why didn't the 911 dispatcher ask for a more detailed description of his skin color? His build? Whether he had facial hair? (He doesn't.) Whether he had a tattoo or piercings? (He doesn't.) Or whether he was wearing a hat? (He was.) Authorities on the scene didn't care about my son's other attributes. He is an honor roll student, saxophone player, basketball player and law-abiding teenager. All they saw was his gender and race. To make matters worse, after handcuffing him, police paraded him to the front of our house in full view of neighbors and passersby, and at least three other armed, uniformed officers surrounded him and me. They leaned him against a cop car, his hands still cuffed behind him, and made him wait so the alleged victim could be driven over to identify him in what's known as a \\"show up.\\" When I protested, asking why my son needed to be handcuffed, they told me he might flee. Give me a break! He's going to try to run with five armed cops and his mother standing near him? The humiliation of being forced to participate in a quasi-lineup was unconscionable. When the alleged victim said our son was not the intruder, the officer uncuffed him and his partners left almost as quickly as they had swarmed in. But before the officer who handcuffed our son left, I demanded an apology. The halfhearted response seemed insincere at best. He didn't even look either of us in the eyes. These officers clearly did not like it that I verbally resisted my son's detainment or my telling them it seemed like racial profiling. That police could handcuff a fully cooperating, nonresisting 13-year-old boy at his home with his mother in plain sight ought to leave all Americans shaking in their boots. It was unnecessary. It was unfair -- un-American. But it happens more often than we know, particularly to young African-Americans, who often don't have the resources to advocate for themselves. This is the United States of America, where one is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. But this rarely applies if you're a male of African descent. Trayvon Martin's killer has claimed self-defense, but did Martin deserve to be approached by a neighborhood watchman and shot to death? He was carrying a bag with soda and some Skittles candy, not a weapon. I'm reminded of the 2009 incident involving Harvard University Professor Henry Louis Gates, one of the nation's top African-American scholars. Gates returned home to find his key wouldn't work because his lock was jammed. Initially, police thought he was breaking into his own home. Even though he produced identification to prove he lived in the house, he was ultimately arrested for disorderly conduct after he angrily accused officers of racial profiling. Prosecutors dropped the charges. I teach at Northwestern University, which is home to the Medill Innocence Project, a program whose work has overturned wrongful convictions and influenced Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's effort to end the state's death penalty. It's not surprising that many of those exonerated are African-American men. In fact, the National Registry of Exonerations tracked 958 former convicts exonerated in the United States. Of that total, 45% were African-American men, even though they make up only about 6%-7% of the country's population. Racial profiling has a long history in the United States and there seems to be little relief in the so-called \\"age of Obama.\\" A 2009 American Civil Liberties Union report called racial and ethnic profiling \\"a widespread and pervasive problem throughout the United States, impacting the lives of millions of people in African-American, Asian, Latino, South Asian and Arab communities.\\" In 2012 it continues to be a common rite of passage for young black males. Just ask any black male you know and he will tell you a story. No wonder some hate the police. My husband and I cannot undo what happened to our son. At 13 he is now officially inducted into black manhood. I shudder to think what could have happened if I had not been home. Thank God we had taught him at around age 10 to cooperate with police. He complied in every way. But what if he'd gotten scared and run? What if he had reached for his cell phone and police thought it was a weapon? The officers never patted him down. What if police had planted something on him? What if the victim had lied and said my son was the perpetrator? To be sure, police officers have a tough and dangerous job and are vulnerable to injury at a moment's notice. They should try to catch criminals, but not at the expense of treating people with respect and dignity. We have to fight crime without automatically indicting black males. The ACLU report concluded that alienating marginalized groups would ultimately prevent police from reducing crime. When police make mistakes, they must own up to them. They could have identified themselves first and politely asked my son some questions with me present. They also could have profusely apologized. Despite our harrowing experience, I know we are lucky. It was 10 minutes of our lives. The truth prevailed and we will move on. But we will never be the same. The incident is forever seared into my brain and is giving me sleepless nights. The worry I already had for my son being away from home or school is now magnified right at the time he wants to be more independent. We've told our son that he shouldn't think all police officers are bad. However, it is clear more training of Evanston dispatchers and police officers is needed. To parents of African-American youth, as your children (particularly males) return to the routine of classes and homework, remember to school them about the police. They are not always their friends. It's unfair that black parents have to teach this lesson while most white parents don't. But if we don't educate them early and often we may be sending them to an early grave.

Q: The movement of molten metal in earth's outer core creates? A: Answer:","completion":"The movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core creates Earth's magnetic field. This phenomenon occurs due to the geodynamo process, which arises from the convective motion of electrically conductive molten metals in the outer core. The outer core is primarily composed of iron and nickel, and their movement generates electric currents that, in turn, create the magnetic field. This process can be understood by examining the three main factors that contribute to the geodynamo: 1. Rotation of the Earth: The Earth's rotation affects the movement of the molten metal in the outer core. This is due to the Coriolis effect, which causes the fluid to move in spiraling, helical paths as it is influenced by the rotational forces. This helps set up the swirling motion necessary for the generation of electric currents. 2. Convection currents: Heat from the Earth's inner core and radioactive decay of elements within the mantle cause differences in temperature within the outer core. These temperature variations lead to convection currents in the molten metal, which rise and fall due to the differences in density that result from heating and cooling. As the heated fluid rises, it cools down, becomes denser, and sinks, setting up a continuous convective cycle within the outer core. This movement of fluid contributes to the generation of electric currents. 3. Induction: When electric currents are generated in the outer core, they in turn create a magnetic field. This magnetic field can induce more electric currents in the fluid motion of the outer core, further intensifying the magnetic field. This self-sustaining feedback loop, known as induction, maintains and strengthens the geodynamo process. The result of these interactions is Earth's magnetic field, which has a significant impact on the planet's environment and its inhabitants. The magnetic field plays a crucial role in protecting the Earth from harmful solar radiation and solar wind, guiding migratory animals, and influencing human technologies such as navigation and communication systems. Therefore, the movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core is responsible for creating this essential feature of our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choices: A). no B). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What is Hepatitis B? Can it be deadly? Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and causes acute or chronic liver disease. It is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is a small, enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family. The infection can lead to both acute and chronic cases. Acute Hepatitis B is a short-term illness, typically lasting several weeks, whereas chronic Hepatitis B is a long-term condition which often persists for many years or even a lifetime. Hepatitis B can be deadly in some cases due to its potential to progress to severe liver complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. In fact, chronic Hepatitis B infection is a major global health concern, as it is the leading cause of liver cancer worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 887,000 deaths occur each year due to Hepatitis B-related complications, making it a severe public health threat. Question 2: How do you get Hepatitis B? Can it be deadly? Hepatitis B is transmitted mainly through exposure to infected blood or other body fluids that contain the virus. The most common routes of transmission include: 1. Mother to child (vertical transmission): Infected mothers may pass the virus to their newborns during childbirth. 2. Sexual contact: The virus can spread through unprotected sexual contact with an infected person. 3. Sharing contaminated needles or syringes: The use of contaminated needles for drug injection, tattooing, or body piercing can transmit the virus. 4. Blood transfusions or organ transplantation: Transmission can occur through receipt of infected blood products or organ transplants. 5. Accidental needlesticks: Healthcare workers may contract the virus through accidental needlesticks or other occupational exposure to contaminated blood. As mentioned earlier, Hepatitis B can be deadly in some individuals. Chronic Hepatitis B infection may lead to life-threatening complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, which contribute to a high number of fatalities each year. The likelihood of disease progression and severity depends on various factors, including age at the time of infection, overall health, and immune system strength. Regarding whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, they are somewhat related, but they do not precisely ask the same question. Question 1 primarily focuses on defining Hepatitis B and inquiring about its potential deadliness, while Question 2 investigates the ways Hepatitis B is transmitted and asks about the risk it poses. However, both questions touch upon the aspect of Hepatitis B being potentially deadly, which can be answered with choice B) yes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office. Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books. Taking them in at noon, she met Stoddard himself.

Your parent or legal guardian will need to call the school and explain that you cannot or will not be coming in that day. Most schools only require your parent or legal guardian to say that you will not be coming into class that day. Some stricter schools, however, might require a specific excuse, so be sure to check your school’s handbook. The idea behind this practice is to reduce the amount of unexcused absences and to keep tabs on the sorts of illnesses going around. Many schools require a parent or legal guardian of a student to call in regardless of that student's age, but some will allow a student who is a legal adult (age 18 or older) to make the phone call on his or her own behalf. For prolonged periods of illness, your school might require you, a parent, a guardian, or a family member to bring a signed doctor's note stating that you are legitimately ill and needing more time to recover. A physician's note becomes necessary after your illness extends beyond a certain period of time. The exact amount of time can vary by district, so you will need to check your school's rules to know at what point the note becomes a necessity.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: the radicle is also growing and producing the primary root. As it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides, producing the typical dicot tap root system. In monocot seeds (Figure 32.21), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused. As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza. Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip. Upon exposure to light (i. when the plumule has exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no longer needed), elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the leaves expand and unfold. At the other end of the embryonic axis, the primary root soon dies, while other, adventitious roots (roots that do not arise from the usual place – i. the root) emerge from the base of the stem. This gives the monocot a fibrous root system. Q: What is root that does not arise from a usual place?

Your job is to translate the Japanese sentence into English. サイレンが鳴り響く中水辺に向かって行ったのです","completion":"The task requires translation of a Japanese sentence to English. I not only possess textual understanding of language but can consider context and small nuances during translations. The sentence in Japanese: \\"サイレンが鳴り響く中水辺に向かって行ったのです\\" Translation step by step: 1. \\"サイレンが鳴り響く\\": The verb 鳴り響く(means \\"to ring out\\" or \\"to resound\\") is modifying サイレン (which translates to \\"siren\\"). So, together it implies \\"the siren is ringing out\\". 2. \\"中\\": This character often denotes the state or condition a person or thing is in. Here, it likely means 'during' or 'while'. 3. \\"水辺に向かって行った\\": This translates as \\"headed towards the waterside\\". 水辺 meaning 'waterside', 向かって meaning 'towards', and 行った meaning 'headed' or 'went'. 4. \\"のです\\": This expression adds explanatory tone in the sentence, indicating that this sentence is explaining or answering something (it connotes a sense of \\"it is that...\\" or \\"the fact is..\\"). So considering the context and literal meaning of each word and phrase, the English translation of the full sentence will be: \\"The fact is, while the siren was ringing out, (someone) headed towards the waterside.\\" We acknowledge that Japanese sentences often omit the subject when it is understood from context, hence the \\"(someone)\\" in brackets in English translation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Peter Dennis Blandford Townshend (born 19 May 1945) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the lead guitarist, backing vocalist, and principal songwriter for the rock band the Who. His career with the Who spans over 50 years, during which time the band grew to be considered one of the most influential bands of the 20th century. Townshend is the main songwriter for the Who, having written well over 100 songs for the band's 11 studio albums, including concept albums and the rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia, plus popular rock radio staples such as Who's Next, and dozens more that appeared as non-album singles, bonus tracks on reissues, and tracks on rarities compilations such as Odds & Sods (1974). He has also written more than 100 songs that have appeared on his solo albums, as well as radio jingles and television theme songs. In addition to his work with the Who, Townshend has been sporadically active as a solo recording artist. Between 1969 and 1971 Townshend, along with other devotees to Meher Baba, recorded a trio of albums devoted to his teachings: Happy Birthday, I Am, and With Love. In response to bootlegging of these, he compiled his personal highlights (and \\"Evolution\\", a collaboration with Ronnie Lane), and released his first major-label solo title, 1972's Who Came First. It was a moderate success and featured demos of Who songs as well as a showcase of his acoustic guitar talents. He collaborated with The Faces' bassist and fellow Meher Baba devotee Ronnie Lane on a duet album (1977's Rough Mix). Townshend's solo breakthrough, following the death of Who drummer Keith Moon, was the 1980 release Empty Glass, which included a top-10 single, \\"Let My Love Open the Door\\" and \\"Rough Boys\\". This release was followed in 1982 by All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, which included the popular radio track \\"Slit Skirts\\". While not a huge commercial success, noted music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as \\"Townshend's most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia.\\" Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the rock opera and related formats, releasing several story-based albums including White City: A Novel (1985), The Iron Man: A Musical (1989), and Psychoderelict (1993). Townshend also got the chance to play with his hero Hank Marvin for Paul McCartney's \\"Rockestra\\" sessions, along with other respected rock musicians such as David Gilmour, John Bonham and Ronnie Lane. Townshend has also recorded several concert albums, including one featuring a supergroup he assembled called Deep End, who performed just three concerts and a television show session for The Tube, to raise money for a charity supporting drug addicts. In 1993 he and Des McAnuff wrote and directed the Broadway adaptation of the Who album Tommy, as well as a less successful stage musical based on his solo album The Iron Man, based upon the book by Ted Hughes. McAnuff and Townshend later co-produced the animated film The Iron Giant, also based on the Hughes story. A production described as a Townshend rock opera and titled The Boy Who Heard Music debuted as part of Vassar College's Powerhouse Summer Theater program in July 2007.

ASHEVILLE, North Carolina (CNN) -- In 1988, a relatively unknown rock and blues guitarist named Warren Haynes got some of his friends together to play music in Asheville, North Carolina. It was just an opportunity for local musicians to jam during the holidays, the one time of year they were all in town together. Warren Haynes' good work has been noted by the street named after him. The artists also wanted to give back to the community, so they gave the money raised by their show to various charities. The tradition has continued. Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, Haynes' Christmas Jam has evolved into an epic annual event for the musicians, fans, and particularly Habitat for Humanity.

This charitable organization, which focuses on building affordable housing for those in need, has greatly benefited from the generosity of Warren Haynes, his fellow musicians, and the dedicated audience who flock to the event each year. Over the past two decades, the Christmas Jam has not only served as an opportunity for these talented artists to come together, but it has also made a significant impact on the Asheville community by providing much-needed financial support for its local Habitat for Humanity chapter. As the event has grown in popularity, so too has the lineup of musicians who have graced its stage. What started as a gathering of friends has transformed into a star-studded show featuring renowned artists from the rock and blues scene. Names like The Allman Brothers Band, Gov't Mule, and The Derek Trucks Band have made frequent appearances at the Christmas Jam, while special guests like Bruce Hornsby, John Mayer, and Susan Tedeschi have added an eclectic mix to the performances. Throughout the years, the event has not strayed from its roots as a down-to-earth gathering of musicians and friends. In addition to the main concert, which now often sells out quickly, smaller pre-Jam and post-Jam shows have been added to the festivities, allowing even more attendees to be a part of this unique holiday experience. These intimate gigs feel like a private party for those lucky enough to secure tickets, giving fans unparalleled access to their favorite musicians while further raising money for a worthy cause. Moreover, the Christmas Jam has evolved into a genuinely collaborative environment, where artists are encouraged to sit in with each other, resulting in once-in-a-lifetime combinations, improvisational masterpieces, and unforgettable performances that cannot be replicated elsewhere. The atmosphere backstage is one of camaraderie and shared passion for music – a testament to the spirit that Warren Haynes has fostered since the event's inception.

AP Photo Rand Paul tweets fake Hillary Clinton to-do list Kentucky Republican Rand Paul continued his Twitter trolling of his rival presidential candidates with an attack on Hillary Clinton. After the Clinton campaign tweeted an image of a “to do” list for campaign manager Robby Mook with a list of items for the next two months of the campaign, Paul tweeted his own fake “to do” list for Team Clinton. Story Continued Below The Clinton campaign’s list included six relatively banal campaign functions like “Sign off on office contracts” and “Set staffing plans June-Dec.” Paul’s note had four items: “Sign off on new private server location”; “Hire next stage of reporters to avoid real questions”; “Finalize plan to evade Benghazi testimony”; and “Final update of foreign ‘contributions’ list.” The Kentucky senator has played the role of Twitter troll on other occasions. He has directed jabs at Marco Rubio for wanting to “build a moat” around Cuba and at Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, who, he joked, have exchanged friendship bracelets. He has also targeted Hillary Clinton before, once posting a fake recorded conversation between her and Bush in which the two discuss their families’ ambition to take turns occupying the White House. ||||| You are on Twitter Mobile because you are using an old version of Safari.

Today, we are going to have fun by learning to fold an 8.5 by 11 inch (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper. This fun activity is super easy and you can do it at home with your family and friends. Are you ready to start folding? Let's go! First, let's make sure we have the right size of paper. We need a piece of paper that is 8.5 inches (22 cm) wide and 11 inches (28 cm) long. This is the most common size of paper, which you can find around your house, maybe in a printer or a notebook. Now that we have our paper, let's start folding! Remember, folding a paper is simply bending it while keeping it in one piece. Step 1: Hold the piece of paper Pick up the piece of paper with both hands, making sure it's lying flat and smooth in front of you. Step 2: Fold the paper lengthwise To fold the paper lengthwise means to fold it from top to bottom, not from side to side. Imagine a line running down the middle of the longest part of the paper. That's where we want to fold. Step 3: Match the corners Bring the top right corner down to meet the bottom right corner. Make sure the edges and corners line up nicely. Do the same thing with the top left corner, bringing it down to the bottom left corner. Step 4: Press the fold Once the top and bottom corners are lined up and the paper is folded in half, use your fingers or the side of your hand to press down on the folded edge firmly. This will make a nice, neat fold line right down the middle of the paper. Step 5: Unfold the paper Now that we have folded our paper, it's time to unfold it. Gently open up the folded paper and lay it flat on the table. You'll see a crease, or line, where you folded it. Congratulations! You just folded and unfolded an 8.5 by 11 inch (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper. You can use this simple folding and unfolding technique to create many different shapes and crafts. Try folding the paper more than once, or practice folding different size papers. You can even use this folded paper as a base for other projects, like making paper airplanes, origami animals, or homemade cards. Keep exploring and have fun folding!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Summarize the following: Wire plate hangers come in different sizes, so you need to know the size of the plate before you can purchase the hangers. Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the vertical length of your plate. If you have a simple circular plate, you only need to know the diameter. Similarly, if you have a perfectly square plate, you only need to know the length of one side. If you have a plate with uneven sides, like an oval or a rectangle, first determine which side will be the vertical side when you hang it. Measure the length of that side and choose your hangers based on that. You should be able to buy a standard wire plate hanger at most hardware stores and craft stores. Look for the size that best fits the dimensions of your plate. Usually, the different size ranges are: 5 to 7 inches (13 to 18 cm) 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) 10 to 14 inches (25 to 35 cm), holding up to 30 lbs (13.6 kg) 14 to 20 inches (35 to 51 cm) There should be two wired ends attached by a long spring. The single wire piece with the pointed center should be hooked over the front top of the plate from the back, and the two-wire end should be hooked over the front bottom of the plate from the back. Note that the spring connecting both ends should be hidden behind the plate. Due to the placement of the spring, the plate will stick out from the wall a bit. Take that into consideration when using these hangers. These hangers work best with plates that are fairly normal in shape and size. If you have to distort the springs too much to make the wires fit, the plate will be unstable and more likely to fall off the wall. Decide where you want the plate to be on the wall and mark the spot with a pencil. Hammer a nail into that spot. At least half of the nail should be inside the wall, but you should also make sure that there is plenty of nail space for the hanger to rest on. To determine where you want the plate, hold it up against the wall and move it around until you find the right spot. Lightly mark the top of the plate with a pencil. Set the plate down, then measure the distance between the top of the plate and the pointed top of the hook. Make another mark on the wall the same distance away from your original mark. The nail should be hammered into this second mark. Carefully hang the pointed end of the top hanger onto the nail on your wall. This should complete the process. Check the plate after you hang it. If it is not evenly aligned, you may need to readjust the positioning of your hangers on the plate. If the plate does not seem secure, change the position of the hanger or nail until it does. Alternatively, try a different hanging method.","completion":"To hang a plate on the wall using wire plate hangers, follow these steps: 1) Determine the plate size using a ruler or tape measure; 2) Buy the appropriate hanger size at a hardware or craft store; 3) Attach the hanger to the plate, making sure the spring is hidden behind the plate; 4) Choose where to hang the plate, marking the spot with a pencil; 5) Hammer a nail into the marked spot, leaving enough space for the hanger; 6) Measure the distance from the plate's top to the hanger's hook, and make another mark on the wall; 7) Hammer the nail into the second mark; 8) Hang the plate and adjust if needed. These hangers work best with plates of standard shapes and sizes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In the new set of initiatives, they are focusing on a variety of sectors that they believe can contribute significantly to a healthier economy. The key sectors identified by the government include agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. These sectors have the potential to provide a remarkable increase in employment opportunities, which would stimulate the economy overall. Agriculture, traditionally a mainstay of Zambia's economy, continues to be a central focus for the government's plan. The government aims to transform the agricultural sector into a more productive and profitable one. Investments and policy interventions are expected to be directed at improving farming practices, encouraging agri-tech innovations and self-sustainability, and promoting advantageous trade deals. The manufacturing sector is another area where the government plans to inject growth initiatives.

They plan to encourage the manufacturing of locally made goods for both local consumption and international trade. Tourism is no exception to the growth plan; and under the new mandate, boosting this sector is seen as a top priority. With Zambia's rich biodiversity and cultural heritage, the government aims to make the country a desired destination for global tourists, thereby significantly increasing tourism revenue. Overall, these ambitious plans outlined by the Zambian government are also aligned with their commitment to sustainable development. By focusing on these priority sectors, the government believes that the economy can experience accelerated growth, create more jobs, diversify income sources, and improve the nation's socio-economic conditions, while still preserving its natural resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Linus Pauling,the only person who has won two undivided Nobel Prizes,was born in Portland,Oregon. He attended Washington High School but because of an unimportant detail he did not receive his diploma until 1962,long after he had received his Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Orgon State College in 1922. He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it. He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the \\"behavior\\" of molecules led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the\\"building blocks of life\\".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell. During World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948. However,the use of the atomic bomb near the end of the war turned Pauling in a new direction. Having long worked on the structure of molecules,he took an immediate interest in the deadly effects of nuclear fallout on human molecular structures. From then on,Pauling protested the production of the hydrogen bomb and supported the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. Through his efforts,The NuclearTestBan Treaty,declaring all nuclear tests to be illegal except underground ones,came into effect on October 10,1963,the same day Linus Pauling was awarded the Nobel Peace.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Adam Craig Gilchrist, AM (; born 14 November 1971), nicknamed \\"Gilly\\" or \\"Churchy\\", is a former Australian international cricketer and former captain of all formats. Widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman in the history of the game, Gilchrist held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket. He was captain of Middlesex in the domestic arena. Gilchrist was selected for the state under-17 team, and in 1989 he was offered a scholarship by London-based Richmond Cricket Club, a scheme he now supports himself. Context: Cricket has for many years debated whether batsmen should \\"walk\\", that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. He has since proclaimed himself to be \\"a walker\\", or a batsman who will consistently walk, and has done so on numerous occasions. On one occasion against Bangladesh, Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out. Gilchrist's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a \\"walking crusade\\" when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: \\"...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...\\". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had \\"zero support in the team\\" for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he \\"felt isolated\\" and \\"silently accused of betraying the team. Implicitly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest.\\" Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka, Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action in 2002, as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to \\"detrimental public comment\\". During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd, threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim. Question: Did anyone oppose the decision? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there was opposition to Adam Gilchrist's decision to be a \\"walker.\\" In his autobiography, he mentioned that he had \\"zero support in the team\\" for his stance and felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He felt isolated and was silently accused of betraying the team, implying that his decision to walk made others look dishonest. Additionally, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a \\"walking crusade\\" in a 2004 match. Gilchrist's actions sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires, showing that his decision had opposition from various quarters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I can vouch, working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in the business. I'm stymied by harsh, insulting criticism for this film, wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue, pondered one thought or concept, or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience. Let \\"The Empty Acre\\" bring itself to you. Don't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror/thriller genre due to its supernatural premise.

Wenceslas was considered a martyr and a saint immediately after his death in the 10th century, when a cult of Wenceslas rose up in Bohemia and in England. Within a few decades of Wenceslas' death, four biographies of him were in circulation. These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages conceptualization of the rex iustus, or \\"righteous king\\"--that is, a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety, as well as from his princely vigor. Referring approvingly to these hagiographies, a preacher from 12th century says: But his deeds I think you know better than I could tell you; for, as is read in his Passion, no one doubts that, rising every night from his noble bed, with bare feet and only one chamberlain, he went around to God's churches and gave alms generously to widows, orphans, those in prison and afflicted by every difficulty, so much so that he was considered, not a prince, but the father of all the wretched. Several centuries later the legend was claimed as fact by Pope Pius II, who himself also walked ten miles barefoot in the ice and snow as an act of pious thanksgiving. Although Wenceslas was, during his lifetime, only a duke, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I posthumously \\"conferred on [Wenceslas] the regal dignity and title\\" and that is why, in the legend and song, he is referred to as a \\"king\\". The usual English spelling of Duke Wenceslas's name, Wenceslaus, is occasionally encountered in later textual variants of the carol, although it was not used by Neale in his version. Wenceslas is not to be confused with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (Wenceslaus I Premyslid), who lived more than three centuries later.

Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (see 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \\"Eight Miles High\\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \\"Why\\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. The song's lyrics are, for the most part, about the group's flight to London in August 1965 and their accompanying English tour, as hinted at by the opening couplet: \\"Eight miles high and when you touch down, you'll find that it's stranger than known.\\" Although commercial airliners fly at an altitude of six to seven miles, it was felt that \\"eight miles high\\" sounded more poetic than six and also recalled the title of the Beatles' song \\"Eight Days a Week\\". According to Clark, the lyrics were primarily his creation, with a minor contribution being Crosby's line, \\"Rain grey town, known for its sound\\"--a reference to London as home to the British Invasion, which was then dominating the U.S. music charts. Other lyrics in the song that explicitly refer to the Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: \\"Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those afraid of losing their ground\\", which is a reference to the hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group the Birds serving the band with a copyright infringement writ, due to the similarities in name. In addition, \\"Round the squares, huddled in storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms\\" describes fans waiting for the band outside hotels, while the line \\"Sidewalk scenes and black limousines\\" refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur-driven cars. Although the basic idea for the song had been discussed during the band's flight to England, it didn't actually begin to take shape until the Byrds' November 1965 tour of the U.S. To alleviate the boredom of traveling from show to show during the tour, Crosby had brought along cassette recordings of Ravi Shankar's music and the John Coltrane albums Impressions and Africa/Brass, which were on constant rotation on the tour bus. The influence of these recordings on the band would manifest itself in the music of \\"Eight Miles High\\" and its B-side \\"Why\\". Clark began writing the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he scribbled down some rough ideas for later development, following a discussion with guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that it was he who conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.

Target estimates breach affected up to 110 million Jan. 10, 2014 at 8:21 AM ET Joe Raedle / Getty Images, file A customer uses a credit card scanner at a Target store. The retailer revealed Friday that the data breach that hit its customers over the heart of the holiday shopping season was almost twice as large as first revealed. The massive data heist at Target stores across the country was more massive than previously revealed, with the retailer saying at least 70 to 110 million customers were hit -- making it one of the largest security breaches of its kind. The newly disclosed victims could include customers whose data was obtained by Target prior to Black Friday. The company said Friday that as part of its ongoing probe it found information for at least 70 million people, apart from the 40 million payment card accounts previously disclosed, was stolen during the data breach. It said this is not a new breach. There may be some overlap between the two groups, Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman said, but it's unclear by how much. The stolen information includes names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses for up to 70 million individuals. “I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,” said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Target, in a statement on its website. “I also want our guests to know that understanding and sharing the facts related to this incident is important to me and the entire Target team.” Target said that much of the data stolen is partial, but in situations where Target has an email address, it will attempt to contact the customers affected by the breach and provide them with tips to guard against consumer scams. Target said it won't ask customers for any personal information when it contacts them. Even though the data is in bits and pieces, it means some of the previously disclosed stolen credit cards can be used to commit fraud in more places online. In addition, it could be a precursor to more widespread identity theft. \\"They steal and combine what was stolen in previous breaches,\\" said Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst at technology research company Gartner. \\"There are warehouses of information on people and dossiers. Now we've got John's credit card, his address, his phone number... they do put it together and sell entire profiles on people.\\" Attorneys general from New York and Massachusetts announced on Friday that they were joining a nationwide probe into the security breach. Target initially reported in mid-December that about 40 million people who used credit or debit cards at its stores November 27th to December 15th had their information compromised. At that time, the company said the information swiped from its systems included customers' names, expiration dates, credit card numbers, and verification codes. The breach was first reported by Krebs on Security, a data security blog. It occurred over some of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season, including Black Friday, and ran from Nov. 27 through Dec. 15, according to Target. It added that customers will have no liability for the cost of any fraudulent charges. And it will offer one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for all customers who shopped in its stores. In 2007, more than 45 million T.J. Maxx and Marshalls customers had their data stolen in what had been one of the largest U.S. corporate data breaches to date. Reuters and NBC's Patrick Rizzo and Matthew DeLuca contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

In both sentences, the main point being conveyed is that the early texts make reference to 18 or 20 old schools. However, there are some slight grammatical differences between the two statements. 1. \\"In early texts, 18 or 20 old schools are mentioned.\\" In this sentence, the lack of an article (\\"the\\") before \\"early texts\\" implies that the statement could be referring to any collection of early texts, including a variety of different sources.

Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Opposition leaders and intellectuals met with Egypt's vice president Saturday to discuss avenues for easing embattled President Hosni Mubarak from power, the number one demand of of tens of thousands of demonstrators. Among the proposals under discussion is Article 139 of the constitution, which allows for the vice president to assume control if the president is no longer able. At least one opposition group, the leftist Tagammu party, is asking the government to activate the article's powers so that Suleiman can take charge immediately and allow Mubarak to make a graceful exit. A member of the self-declared Committee of the Wise, told CNN that Suleiman was willing to listen. Mubarak, said the committee, can remain as a symbolic leader but should delegate to","completion":"Vice President Omar Suleiman most of his functions and duties. The talks, in part aimed at steering Egypt’s impending constitutional crisis into more manageable waters, have led to this proposal to bring about a peaceful transition of power while still respecting the construct of Egypt’s political system. The proposal is part of a broader set of demands from the opposition, which also includes calls for free and fair elections, the lifting of the emergency law stagnant since 1981, putting an end to political corruption and installing a civilian government. The meeting with Suleiman is part of a nationwide conversation about the future of governance in Egypt, and represents growing downswing in Mubarak’s powerbase, who has ruled with a heavy hand for 30 years. Article 139 of the Egyptian constitution stipulates that should the presidential post become vacant or if the president were to become incapacitated, the vice president would fill the role until new elections can be held. The proposition to delegate presidential powers to Vice President Suleiman, using provisions from this article, underscores the gravity of the situation and the extent of the demands of the protestors. While the technocratic Suleiman is seen by many as a more palatable choice, there remains significant apprehension concerning his ties with the existing regime, in specific reference to his former role as the head of the Egyptian Intelligence Services during Mubarak’s reign. Nevertheless, there is consensus to acknowledge him as a temporary solution while constitutional revisions are made for a democratically elected president. Suleiman’s assumption of power, therefore, will be steeped in the need for careful diplomacy, to ensure that it is recognized as more than a mere substitution of rulers but a precursor to real democracy. He would be expected to uphold the commitments of reshaping the government and taking significant steps to satisfy the expectations of the Egyptian people. This includes undertaking urgent and substantial action to address the systemic issues at the heart of the protests, such as political corruption and lack of civil liberties. Overall, although the discourse is in its early stages, the ongoing talks between opposition leaders and the vice president indicate sincere attempts to navigate the crisis and restructure the political landscape in Egypt. It is a complex and delicate task, requiring a careful balancing act between meeting the demands of the protestors while maintaining the stability of the country. While Vice President Suleiman may be positioned to oversee this transition, his leadership will be under heavy scrutiny and the road to democracy will be a long, arduous journey for all Egyptians."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may even have entered the shop just to find a shelter from a sudden shower. Whatever the reason is, you can soon be totally unaware of your surroundings. You soon become attracted in some books or others, and usually it is only much later that you realize you have spent too much time there and must dash off to keep some forgotten appointments. This opportunity to escape the realities of everyday life is the main attraction of a bookshop. A music shop is very much like a bookshop. You can wander round such a place to your heart's content.

In a bookshop an assistant should remain in the back ground until you have finished reading. Then, and only then, are his services necessary. Once a medical student had to read a text book which was far too expensive for him to buy. He couldn't obtain it from the library and the only copy he could find was in a certain bookshop. Every afternoon, therefore, he would go along to the shop and read a little of the book at a time. One day, however, he was disappointed to find the book missing from its usual place.

Tommy is restless and instead of following the call script, he often counsels people on how to defraud Lovell's company. When Tommy sees some mafiosos in his neighborhood, he grows enraged. He calls them fat old guys living off their reputation, and he resents the way the mafia treated his father. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Tommy's father started his shop with a mafia loan, and he suffered frequent beatings when he was late with payments.

They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their different personalities, though both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day. Although they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps. Much of the film subsequently takes place in Joel's mind during this memory erasure procedure. As his memories are erased, he tries to evade the erasing effects of the procedure by hiding Clementine in remote parts of his unconscious. Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of love with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts to either hide the memories or wake up and stop the process, the memories are slowly erased.

We will keep open lines of communication.\\" But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable.

These subdivisions are locally referred to as \\"hamaynkner\\" in Armenian.

Sentence 2: Although Fresnel did not know that electromagnetic waves are light, he managed to construct the first coherent theory of light in the world. Step 2: Identify the key differences between the two sentences. The key difference between the two sentences is the understanding of the relationship between light waves and electromagnetic waves.

(AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had people getting less oxygen to their cells? A:","completion":"Team One B: Team Two Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the answer is B: Team Two. Team Two consists of people with sickle-cell anemia, which is a genetic disorder that affects the shape and function of red blood cells. In a person with sickle-cell anemia, some red blood cells are irregularly shaped, resembling a crescent or sickle instead of the typical disc shape. These misshapen cells can have difficulty navigating through small blood vessels and may even get stuck, impeding blood flow. Additionally, sickle red blood cells are more fragile and prone to breaking apart, leading to a reduced number of healthy red blood cells within the body. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. In the case of sickle-cell anemia, the abnormal red blood cells are less efficient at transporting oxygen, resulting in a lack of sufficient oxygen reaching the body's cells and tissues. As a consequence, individuals with sickle-cell anemia often experience fatigue, shortness of breath, and reduced endurance due to the decreased oxygen supply to their cells. In contrast, Team One consists of healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, enabling them to efficiently deliver oxygen to their body's cells. Thus, Team Two, with people suffering from sickle-cell anemia, has individuals getting less oxygen to their cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, within the framework of the eight precepts, which are more stringent and are generally observed by lay followers on observance days and by monastics (monks and nuns), the third precept undergoes an alteration from avoiding sexual misconduct to a vow of celibacy which implies total abstinence from any sort of sexual activity. The eight precepts serve to support meditation practice and mind training, purifying one's conduct, and creating wholesome, beneficial habits. By voluntarily submitting to these self-imposed rules, observant Buddhists look to cultivate ethical behavior, mindfulness, and wisdom. The eight precepts are typically undertaken by laypeople during periods of intensive meditation practice or during a temporary monastic retreat. Here is a brief list of the eight precepts: 1. To abstain from killing living beings. 2. To abstain from stealing. 3. To abstain from all sexual activities. 4. To abstain from wrong speech (lying, harsh language, slander, idle chatter). 5. To abstain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to carelessness. 6. To abstain from eating at the wrong time (the right time being after sunrise and before noon). 7. To abstain from dancing, singing, music, going to shows, wearing garlands, beautifying with perfumes and adornments. 8. To abstain from high and luxurious places for sitting or sleeping. So, the modified form of the third precept in the context of the eight precepts indeed becomes a pledge of celibacy. This means complete abstinence from sexual behavior, not just refraining from harmful sexual conduct. This vow of celibacy supports the single-pointed focus often required for intensive meditation practice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Navajo and Apache tribes are two of those tribes, and each one has their own way of doing things. For the Navajo Tribe, they do something called the Night Chant. Imagine a big sleepover where people sing special songs and dance with friends and family for a few nights. This helps remember the person who died and brings everyone closer. For the Apache Tribe, they do the Sunrise Dance, which is like a big party that happens when the sun comes up. It's a special dance for young girls because it shows they are becoming grown-ups. This dance brings good health and blessings to the person who died and their family. Your two questions may look a bit similar but are not exactly the same. The first part of both questions is the same, but the second part asks about different tribes.

The book's cover says that it is by \\"James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed\\". The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book titled Houdini, His Life and Art. This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini. Randi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled The Magic World of the Amazing Randi, which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures.

Step 1: Analyze the first sentence \\"The quality of mercy is not strained\\" -- Shakespeare. In this sentence, \\"quality\\" refers to a characteristic or an attribute of the concept of mercy. Here, it means the nature or aspect of mercy, which is not forced or strained. In this context, \\"quality\\" represents a distinctive feature of mercy. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence \\"While being impulsive can be great for artists, it is not a desirable quality for engineers.\\" In this sentence, \\"quality\\" refers to a characteristic or property of an individual, specifically an engineer. The statement implies that impulsiveness might be helpful for artists, but it isn't a desirable attribute for engineers to have. Here, \\"quality\\" also represents a distinctive feature, but it is related to a person's personality or behavior. Step 3: Compare the meanings and determine if they are the same In both sentences, the word \\"quality\\" is used to describe a characteristic or attribute, either of an abstract concept (mercy) or a person (engineers). Although the contexts in which \\"quality\\" is used are different (one abstract and one related to a person), the underlying meaning of the word as a distinctive feature or characteristic remains consistent. Conclusion: The word \\"quality\\" means the same thing in both sentences – a distinctive characteristic or attribute – even though the specific context and subject matter in which the word is used differ."},{"prompt":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Geppetto for the following movie plot: After singing the film's signature song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\", Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true.

The Blob Movie plot: Left off after the events of the first movie The Blob, an oil pipeline layer named Chester (Godfrey Cambridge) returns to his suburban Los Angeles home from the North Pole, bringing with him a small sample of a mysterious frozen substance uncovered by a bulldozer on a job site. Prior to taking the blob to a lab to be analyzed, he places the storage container with the substance in his freezer, but he and his wife (Marlene Clark) accidentally let it thaw, releasing \\"the Blob\\". It starts by eating a fly, then a kitten, Chester's wife, and then Chester himself (while he is watching a television broadcast of the film The Blob). Lisa (Gwynne Gilford), a friend, walks in to see Chester being devoured by the Blob. She escapes, but cannot get anyone to believe her, not even her boyfriend Bobby (Robert Walker, Jr.). Meanwhile, the rapidly growing creature quietly preys upon the town. Some of its victims include a police officer and two hippies (Cindy Williams and Randy Stonehill) in a storm drain, a barber (Shelley Berman) and his client, transients (played by director Hagman, Burgess Meredith and Del Close), a Scoutmaster (Dick Van Patten), a farm full of chickens, and a bar full of people. At one point, Lisa and Bobby find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. In the panic, the truck's air conditioning is accidentally switched on and the Blob retreats because of its vulnerability to cold. The now-massive blob then invades a bowling alley and a skating rink (consuming dozens more people in the process). It is finally stopped when Bobby activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing it. While the frozen blob is being filmed by a television crew, one of the crew's bright lights is positioned on the ground, melting a small portion of it, which oozes toward the sheriff and envelopes his feet as he is speaking on camera. Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Beware! The Blob,\\" the person who finally stops the Blob is Bobby, played by Robert Walker, Jr. The events leading up to the Blob's defeat begin when Bobby and Lisa, played by Gwynne Gilford, find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. In their panic, they accidentally switch on the truck's air conditioning, causing the Blob to retreat because of its vulnerability to cold temperatures. As the now-massive Blob continues to consume more people and grow in size, it invades a bowling alley and a skating rink. The climax of the movie takes place at the skating rink, where Bobby figures out how to stop the Blob once and for all. He activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing the Blob and preventing it from causing further harm. However, in the final scene, we see that the frozen Blob is being filmed by a television crew. One of the crew members inadvertently positions a bright light on the ground, which melts a small portion of the Blob. This liquid-like blob oozes towards the sheriff, who is speaking on camera at the time, and envelopes his feet. While Bobby is the one who initially stops the Blob, it is important to note that the movie leaves viewers with an open-ended conclusion, hinting at the Blob's possible return in future films. This unresolved ending could be a factor to consider when deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, as it may be a reason for the film's success or failure. Additionally, it's crucial to evaluate other factors such as the film's target audience, production budget, and potential return on investment before making a decision."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.

Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ...

What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small.

Choices: - enjoy - tasty - health problems - hunger - indigestion The rationale to choose \\"tasty\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"Tasty The rationale for choosing \\"tasty\\" as the answer to the question, \\"What about eating hamburgers makes someone want more?\\" is rooted in the basic human need for pleasure and satisfaction derived from food consumption. The other choices provided do not capture the key motivation behind why people may crave or desire more hamburgers. Here is a deeper analysis of each choice: 1. Enjoy: While enjoyment is certainly a factor when it comes to eating hamburgers, it is too broad a term to pinpoint the exact reason someone would want more. Enjoyment can come from a variety of factors, such as the company one keeps while eating, the ambiance of the location, or personal nostalgia associated with the food. Although enjoyment plays a role in food consumption, it does not solely explain the reason behind wanting more hamburgers. 2. Tasty: This answer choice directly addresses the appealing flavors and textures found in hamburgers. When something is tasty, it is palatable and pleasurable to eat, which often results in wanting more of it. Hamburgers contain various components like juicy meat, melted cheese, crisp vegetables, and flavorful sauces, all enclosed in soft buns. The combination of these elements creates a taste sensation that is hard to resist and leaves people craving more. 3. Health problems: Health problems are a negative consequence that may arise from indulging in excessive consumption of hamburgers. They are not the driving factor behind the desire for more hamburgers; in fact, they often act as a deterrent. Chronic health problems such as obesity, heart diseases, and high blood pressure can be caused by a diet high in fast-food and saturated fats, like those found in many hamburgers. 4. Hunger: Hunger is certainly a factor that causes someone to eat a hamburger in the first place, but it is not specific to hamburgers. Hunger is a physiological need that can be satiated by any food, not just hamburgers. Additionally, once hunger is satisfied, it further decreases the likelihood of wanting more hamburgers. Therefore, hunger does not explain why someone would specifically crave more hamburgers. 5. Indigestion: Indigestion is another negative consequence that might be experienced after the consumption of hamburgers, especially if they are eaten in large quantities or are greasy. Indigestion is typically an uncomfortable sensation and would not motivate someone to want more hamburgers. It generally serves as a reason to avoid or limit the intake of hamburgers rather than encourage cravings for them. In conclusion, the choice \\"tasty\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question because it reflects the inherent pleasure derived from the delicious combination of flavors and textures in hamburgers. While enjoyment, hunger, health problems, and indigestion may all play a role in a person's experience with hamburgers, the specific desire for more hamburgers is best explained by their tastiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Here's a short story: Milo was flying his helicopter when he learned that it experienced more resistance through windy sky then through calm sky. This means he was forced to fly less quickly through (A) windy sky (B) calm sky. What is the most sensical answer between \\"windy sky\\" and \\"calm sky\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"windy sky\\" and \\"calm sky\\" is (A) windy sky. This is because, as mentioned in the short story, Milo encountered more resistance when flying his helicopter through windy sky than through calm sky. Resistance, or drag, is a force that opposes the motion of an object through a fluid, such as air. In the context of aviation, resistance experienced by an aircraft is a result of its interaction with the air it is flying through. In the case of Milo's helicopter, the resistance is higher in windy conditions than in calm conditions. Wind can generate turbulence, which increases the air resistance, requiring the helicopter to exert more power to maintain its speed and altitude. Additionally, when the helicopter is flying against the wind, it has to overcome the force of the wind to maintain its course. This means the helicopter would have to work harder to push against the wind, thus reducing its airspeed and overall performance. Conversely, when flying through calm sky, the air is relatively still, resulting in less turbulence and less air resistance. This allows the helicopter to maintain its intended speed and altitude more efficiently since it is not being pushed around by the wind. Therefore, considering the given situation, Milo would indeed be forced to fly less quickly through windy sky compared to calm sky due to the increased air resistance experienced in the windy conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. and the situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. Answer the following question: In which case the products concentration would decrease, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In case B, the products concentration would decrease. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, when the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease and the concentrations of the reactants increase. In case A, the forward reaction is favored, which means the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. Therefore, it is in case B where the products concentration would decrease as the reverse reaction is favored."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it.

Paragraph: Zinni feared that Bin Laden would in the future locate himself in cities, where U.S. missiles could kill thousands of Afghans. He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

Article:However the health ministry has put the death toll lower, at 38. The army ousted Mr Morsi on 3 July. He has been formally accused of murder, relating to a 2011 jail outbreak, and of links to the militant group Hamas. Both pro- and anti-Morsi demonstrators held huge protests overnight in the capital. By Quentin SommervilleBBC News, Cairo There were pools of blood all over the field hospital. Many of the injured were in bad shape. Some had parts of their head missing - taken out by bullets. The battle raged last night and all morning. We heard automatic gunfire. Protesters formed a human shield around us as shotguns and CS gas were fired towards us. There was the sound of outgoing shots too. The air was thick with tear gas and people were vomiting. There was a child, maybe 12, covered in blood. He was deathly white. They closed the doors at the hospital as they could not accept more wounded, but the ambulances were still arriving. As we left, a child was dragged from a car by the Morsi supporters outside the mosque. He was given a very serious beating. See Quentin's Twitter reports In pictures: Cairo clashes The anti-Morsi camp occupied Cairo's Tahrir Square in support of the army, after its chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, had urged people to demonstrate to provide a mandate for its intervention. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Morsi supporters continued their sit-in protest at the mosque in the Nasr City area. On Saturday, Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim vowed to end the sit-in, saying local residents had complained about the encampment. He said the protest would be \\"brought to an end soon, and in a legal manner\\" with an order from the prosecutor, although this has yet to happen. The BBC's Jim Muir in Cairo says the latest violence is the most serious since the army's intervention to remove President Morsi, but this does not appear to have been a planned campaign to clear the area around the mosque. It appears that clashes began after some of the Morsi supporters tried to block a main road in the area, and security forces responded. The state news agency Mena quotes a security official as saying they had been trying to stop fighting between rival sides, and that eight security personnel had been injured. The official added that live fire had not been used, only tear gas. But our correspondent says medics at the hospital believed about 70% of the casualties were caused by live fire - with many of the victims hit in the chest or head by snipers firing from rooftops. Ahmed Nashar, a Brotherhood spokesman witnessed what happened near the Nasr City mosque where demonstrators built a wall to protect themselves. \\"When I arrived, bullets were whizzing past my ears,\\" he told the BBC. \\"Today was just brutal - people were fired at, with live firearms.\\" Our correspondent says Morsi supporters are furious about the role the military is taking, and in particular the head of the army, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom they say is killing Egyptians. Egypt's pro-Muslim Brotherhood TV station, Ahrar 25, quoted the coalition that supports Mr Morsi - the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy - as saying it held Gen Sisi responsible for the deaths at the mosque protest. There has also been violence in Egypt's second city of Alexandria, where at least 10 people have been killed in clashes between rival factions. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she \\"deeply deplored\\" the latest deaths in Egypt. Her spokesman called \\"on all actors to refrain from violence and to respect the principles of peaceful protest\\". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said: \\"Now is the time for dialogue, not confrontation. It is the responsibility of leaders on all sides to take steps to reduce tensions.\\" Mr Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, has been formally remanded in custody at an undisclosed location for an initial 15-day period, according to a judicial order on Friday. The order was the first official statement on Mr Morsi's legal status since he was overthrown. He has now been formally accused of the \\"premeditated murder of some prisoners, officers and soldiers\\" when he and several Muslim Brotherhood leaders were freed during a breakout at a Cairo prison in January 2011. He is alleged to have plotted attacks on jails in the uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. Mr Morsi is also accused of conspiring with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip and has strong links with the Muslim Brotherhood. Two human rights activists visited Mr Morsi's place of detention on Friday, although he reportedly refused to meet them, instead sending his chief of presidential staff Refaa el-Tahtawy - who is also held at the location. Mr Tahtawy told the visitors they were being treated well but complained that they were unable to meet relatives. On Saturday, the interior minister Ibrahim said that Mr Morsi would be transferred to Torah Prison, where Mubarak is being held. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Clashes in Cairo, Egypt, between pro- and anti-Morsi demonstrators have led to a reported death toll of 38 people, although the health ministry claims the number is lower, with a count of 120 dead and over 200 injured.

It used to be a strong solid buffet amongst it's peers. If complacency is the fodder of mediocrity, I feel it's my duty to point out the flaws to ensure Feast Buffet knows they need to keep their eyes on the prize and regain their position as solid buffet in the competitive AYCE world of dining... I had the Friday Seafood Buffet for 25, and it was pretty far off the mark. The meat carving station beef was overcooked and a bit dry. Another example is the Asian station's white Bao bread was clearly sitting for hours, as they were harder than croutons and not soft and fluffy. They should have removed 'em as an option so people don't get a bad perception, or better yet, replace 'em with new ones. The seafood itself like the snow crab legs were no better and probably worst than what an AYCE buffet eater would get at a local 9.99 Asian AYCE Buffet as the standard seafood fare. The other seafood was mainstream stuff (shrimp, etc.) you always see, so nothing unique. Not like the Seafood Buffet at The Rio let's say. With a local 2 for 1 coupon, this would be worth 12.50, but at 25, it's a hard meal to justify paying for. I / we, didn't have one 'tho.

The service was friendly but sub-par based only on neglect as opposed to being offensive, as they're seemingly understaffed (or at least that night they were). In the heyday, The Red Rock was the quintessential place to visit... it was cool, hip and defined swagger. The pool was where the beautiful people lounged, the Cherry nightclub was hip and hoppin', at night, the crowds were young and sexy. Now, the Red Rock as a hotel casino is turning a bit more drab and stoggy and not in an upper crust old money or classy way, but in that it (The Red Rock as a whole) seems to no longer appeal to the beautiful people or the trendy movers and shakers anymore. The buffet used to be a \\"go to\\" standard of excellence, so I'm not sure if the economy has forced 'em to cut corners or not (thus the locals and their 2 for 1 coupons, so maybe it's priced and formatted assuming most are paying less - - but if you're paying full price it's pretty harsh to justify and they should just lower the price universally and get rid of the coupons if they're looking to bring in tonnage of customers) but I'd like to give 'em another try and have 'em get back a \\"*\\" or two \\"* *\\" and earn a high praise recommendation that I used to highly tout about the place.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you assume you know what best friends' roles are, you could get disappointed and frustrated. Best friends are the most valuable friends you have, but they can't help or support you in every aspect of your life. Do not expect them to always be there, or expect them to say the thing you want to hear. If you set expectations for your best friends that are too high, it will only leave you disappointed and defeated. Be your own caretaker. This comes back to being your own best friend and taking care of yourself. If you take care of yourself, you'll never put your friend in a position where they have to come in and rescue you. If you never put your friend in this position, you'll never be disappointed. Remember that no one is perfect - not even your best friend. Everyone has their own faults, and they need to work through it. Don't be mean to your friend about their faults, but help them work through it while asking for help on your own as well. However, when gently letting your friend know, understand that your friend has feelings, and it's best to only focus on the faults that are the biggest threat to your friendship. Know what faults to ignore/let go of and what faults to help your friend solve. Sometimes, you need to let your friend solve their faults without your help, unless they ask for your assistance. Constant nagging will make your friend feel stressed and angry, and they may be unwilling to improve your friendship if you're putting pressure on it. It's natural to stop having chemistry with a certain person. If you grow apart, for whatever reason, just be happy for the good times, and know how lucky you were to have that great person be a part of your life. If neither of you make an effort to get together, or if you get into fights with them for no reason, then maybe you weren't meant to be best friends. It's not anyone's fault. Maybe you two are too much alike. Who knows? You might just need a break from one another for a few weeks. Always treat your friend with respect, even if you grow apart.

While still an active player, Palmer did color commentary for ABC for their coverage of the 1978, 1980 and 1982 American League Championship Series, 1981 American League Division Series between Oakland and Kansas City, and the 1981 World Series. From 1985 to 1989, Palmer formed an announcing team with Al Michaels and Tim McCarver at ABC. Palmer announced the 1985 World Series, where he was supposed to team with Michaels and Howard Cosell, whom Palmer had worked with on the previous year's ALCS. McCarver replaced Cosell for the World Series at the last minute after Cosell released a book (I Never Played the Game) that was critical of the ABC Sports team. The team of Palmer, Michaels and McCarver would subsequently go on to call the 1986 All-Star Game (that year, Palmer worked with Michaels on the ALCS while McCarver teamed with Keith Jackson on ABC's coverage of the National League Championship Series), the 1987 World Series, and 1988 All-Star Game as well as that year's NLCS. Palmer was present at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on October 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit prior to Game 3 of the World Series. After the 1989 season, ABC lost its contract to broadcast baseball to CBS.

Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients?

Movie plot title: Tremors 4: The Legend Begins Movie plot: In 1889, the inhabitants of Rejection (later Perfection) are completely dependent on the income from a nearby silver mine. One day, ahot spring causes Graboid eggs to hatch, resulting in the death of 17 miners. Hiram Gummer, great-grandfather of Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the mine's owner, arrives in town to fix the problem. After Graboids attack his camp one night, he is shocked by their presence. One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickax, and the pair escapes. Inexperienced and not fond with firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive but not before discovering that a total of four Graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fate. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In Carson City, Hiram hears a telegram revealing that the fully-grown Graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the Graboids, and helps the town ready itself. After two Graboids are killed, the third and final one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the wheel of a steam traction engine. The Graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact. With the creatures dead, the town decides to keep them secret out of fear that no one would settle in the area if their existence was known, and use the proceeds from the mine to pay for their belongings. Hiram settles in Rejection, building his home in the same place that his great-grandson Burt's would one day be. He is also given a Colt 1865 Gatling gun and begins target practice, enjoying it.

Nejsou to nepřátelé. Pošlete do suterénu zdravotníky. Which language is this?","completion":"The language in question is Czech, which is the official language of the Czech Republic. This West Slavic language is spoken by the majority of the population in the country and has close ties to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages. To dig deeper into the Czech language, it has a rich history dating back to the 9th century. It was brought to light during the country's national revival period around the 19th century, a time when the Czech language made a comeback after years of decline and suppression during the Austro-Hungarian rule. The revival was spearheaded by Josef Dobrovský and Josef Jungmann who initiated a huge campaign to restore the value and usage of the language. Pronounced \\"Chesh-ski\\" in the Czech language, the language uses the Latin script with a number of specific additional symbols formed by diacritics, which are grapheme or alphabetic symbols, composed with certain accents. These letters include ě, š, č, ř, ž, ý, á, í, é, and ú among others. Czech vocabulary has been influenced significantly by Latin and German, but also borrowed words from English and French languages. The grammar is highly inflected, like Latin, and words have many different forms based on their grammatical roles in sentences. Word order is more flexible than in English because the relations between words are shown by the word endings. Coming back to the sentence given \\"Nejsou to nepřátelé. Pošlete do suterénu zdravotníky.\\", it can be translated to English as \\"They are not enemies. Send medics to the basement.\\" This sentence could be from a variety of contexts, such as military, gaming, emergency services, or even action movies. The beauty of the Czech language is exhibited in its unique features and characteristics, not common to other languages, like the complex system of noun declension, the presence of the notoriously difficult-to-pronounce ř sound, and a fascinating tendency to create long compound words. All this makes the study of Czech language a challenging but rewarding journey for language enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice. The director explained his drawings showed \\"unfitness for painting\\" and suggested Hitler was better suited to studying architecture. Though this was an interest of his, he lacked the academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school. On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47. In 1909 Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and Meldemannstrasse dormitory. He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna's sights. During his time in Vienna he pursued a growing passion for two interests, architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, his favorite Wagner opera. It was here that Hitler first became exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the climate of virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived. Georg Ritter von Schonerer became a major influence on Hitler. He also developed an admiration for Martin Luther. Hitler read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews. He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer. The origin and development of Hitler's anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate. His friend, August Kubizek, claimed that Hitler was a \\"confirmed anti-Semite\\" before he left Linz. However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek's claim as \\"problematical\\". While Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna, Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna. Historian Richard J. Evans states that \\"historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany's defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid \\"stab-in-the-back\\" explanation for the catastrophe\\". Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.

Lure your cat out with a toy.\\"","completion":"Title: Fostering Bond and Trust with Your Feline Friend: The Art of Calling and Luring Your Cat Introduction Cats have a reputation for being majestic independence aficionados. Their aloof mannerisms can sometimes leave their humans at a distance, seemingly invisible to their purr-powered companions. Though they may exhibit traits that appear indifferent to their humans, cats are indeed capable of bonding with their humans and can demonstrate a deep affection with them. The key lies in effective communication, one aspect of which includes voice commands - like calling your cat. This article explores the steps you may take to facilitate this bond and trust using techniques such as feeding, toy lures, and most importantly, the art of calling your cat. The Importance of Calling Your Cat Learning how to effectively call your cat is an aspect often overlooked, yet it is fundamental in bridging the communication gap between feline and human. Felines, just like their canine counterparts, are capable of perceiving and responding to voice commands. The first step to this is associating their 'calling' with something they love or enjoy. This could be their favorite kitty treat, mealtime, or a rousing play session with their favorite toy. I. Offering Food or Treats The way to a cat's heart is often through their stomach. Meals and treats create a powerful positive effect on a cat's sensory and emotional relationship with their owners. Regular feeding triggers associations with survival and safety, thus fostering trust. Treats, on the other hand, provide an excellent mechanism for positive reinforcement. When calling your cat, have their favorite food or treat ready. As soon as they come over, reward them immediately. The immediate reward strengthens the association between your call and the positive outcome, i.e., tasty food or treats. Over time, your cat will learn that leaving their cozy corner or interrupting their grooming session to respond to your call leads to a worthy experience. II. Using Toys to Lure Your Cat Playing engages a cat's senses and instincts, creating opportunities for bonding and building trust. Luring your cat out with a toy not only serves as an effective way to get them to respond to your call but it also provides much-needed mental stimulation. After calling their name, you can shake a toy or move it around to grab their attention. The combination of sound, movement, and the anticipation of a playful interaction will pique their interest, drawing them to you. Once your cat responds to your call and comes over, engage them in a playful interaction with the toy. This immediate playtime reinforces the notion that responding to your call is a positive and fun experience. Creating a Pattern and Developing Consistency Consistency is key in training your cat to respond to your call. Make sure to use the same tone and volume each time you call them. This consistency helps your cat associate that particular sound with the positive reinforcement coming afterward. Conclusion Cats, with their independent spirits, can sometimes pose a challenge for even the most patient humans. However, by leveraging their love for food, treats, and toys, we can effectively communicate and create stronger bonds with our feline friends. Calling your cat and subsequently rewarding them with their favorite food/treat or engaging in a fun playtime helps develop trust and establish you not only as their owner but also as their friend. Remember, consistency and patience are keys in establishing this reward-response relationship. By understanding and effectively implementing these techniques of calling your cat, luring them with food, treats, or toys, you open the doors to a relationship filled with enjoyable and rewarding interactions with your feline companion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the ground state of the Hilbert space). In quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as 'QED vacuum' to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics, denoted as QCD vacuum. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no photons. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally.

Answer the following question: who sings the song it never rains in southern california?","completion":"The song \\"It Never Rains in Southern California\\" is sung by Albert Hammond, an esteemed British singer-songwriter and record producer. Born on May 18, 1944, in London, United Kingdom, Hammond is renowned for his extraordinary musical contributions and numerous international hits. \\"It Never Rains in Southern California\\" was penned by Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood, and it serves as the captivating title track of Hammond's 1972 debut album. The song narrates the story of a struggling artist who moves to Southern California in pursuit of fame and success, only to face hardships and disappointment. It's a metaphorical title, suggesting that while the weather may be pleasant, sunny, and ideal, the struggle to find success as an artist can be quite tumultuous and challenging. The song went on to become a major hit, reaching number 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1972, and enjoyed substantial airplay on various radio stations throughout the 1970s and beyond. Its catchy melody, thought-provoking lyrics, and Hammond's emotive vocal performance have secured \\"It Never Rains in Southern California\\" a special place in the annals of popular music. Apart from this enduring classic, Albert Hammond has co-written several successful songs for other artists, such as \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" for The Hollies, \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" for Starship, and \\"One Moment in Time\\" for Whitney Houston. His impressive career, spanning over five decades, attests to his immense talent and significance in the global music scene."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: They have said some of their findings were based on \\"contaminated data\\". Meanwhile, a study in Science claimed the virus could not be reliably detected in ME patients, even in the labs which originally made the link. Understanding of chronic fatigue syndrome is poor. It may be many diseases and the causes are uncertain. There was a sense of hope for many patients when a study published in Science in 2009 showed that DNA from a mouse virus, XMRV, was present in 67% of patients with the illness, but only 4% of the general population. Yet other scientists around the world could not find evidence of the virus. Many researchers began to argue that the most likely explanation was contamination of the laboratory samples. It led to Science asking the authors to withdraw their findings and it published an editorial \\"expression of concern\\" saying that the validity of the study was \\"seriously in question\\". The authors have now issued a partial retraction after some of the scientists involved reported contamination, but this only calls into question the information in one table and two diagrams, not the rest of the paper and not the final conclusion. One of the labs involved, the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada, is standing by the conclusion. One of its lead researchers, Dr Vincent Lombardi, said it was \\"participating\\" in the retraction but: \\"We want to make it very clear that we are continuing the important work of studying retroviruses in association with ME/CFS and other similarly complex illnesses. \\"WPI's more recent retroviral work, although still in the early stages of discovery, continues to warrant additional investigations.\\" Dr Jonathan Stoye, virologist at the Medical Research Council National Institute of Medical Research in the UK, said: \\"I don't think this partial retraction has any meaning, it would have been nice to have a complete rather than a partial retraction. \\"They're saying the rest of the paper still stands, but that is becoming increasingly difficult for them to maintain.\\" A fresh study on XMRV published in Science, which the researchers behind the original study participated in, again questioned the link. Samples of blood were collected from 15 patients who had previously tested positive for XMRV, 14 of whom also had chronic fatigue syndrome, and from 15 patients without XMRV. These samples were sent to nine laboratories, including two which had found the link previously. No lab knew which samples were from which patients. Only two laboratories, the two which initially proposed the link, detected any cases of XMRV. However, the virus was detected at \\"similar rates\\" in both groups of patients, the study said. The results from the two laboratories were also \\"inconsistent\\" even when testing blood from the same patient. Dr Charles Shepherd, medical adviser to the ME Association said: \\"These are very emphatic negative or inconsistent findings from the Blood Working Group study, along with the retraction of some of the original supporting data that was published in Science. \\"So it is now looking extremely unlikely that XMRV is either linked to ME/CFS or that it has a disease-causing role. \\"Having had their hopes raised that a treatable component to ME/CFS had been identified, it's not surprising that people are becoming increasingly disappointed at the way things are turning out. But it's too early to send out the scientific jury to make a final definitive decision on XMRV and ME/CFS - we still need the results from the other major multi-centre study on XMRV and ME/CFS being carried out in America by Prof Ian Lipkin.\\"","completion":"So, some scientists found that a mouse virus called XMRV was in many sick people with something called chronic fatigue syndrome. But, other scientists could not find the same thing and thought maybe there was a mistake in the first study. They decided to do another study, and they couldn't find the virus in the sick people. So now, they think it's not very likely that the XMRV virus is causing this sickness. But they will keep studying to make sure and find out more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Story highlights The support from the local community has been overwhelming It's also stocked with other essential supplies, like soap (CNN) Little Free Libraries, those boxes full of books for people to freely take, are a common sight on people's lawns. But Roman Espinoza's lawn in Watertown, New York, has something different: a \\"Blessing Box\\" filled with food available to any and all who need it. The concept is simple. The box is a miniature food pantry -- receiving items from those who want to donate, and offering it to those who need them. \\"Whether you're taking or giving, you can just go to the blessing box,\\" Espinoza told CNN. \\"There's not a lock on it -- it's open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\" A community rallies The idea came to the 46-year-old Army veteran while taking a class on human services at a local community college. Espinoza was shocked to discover the school had a food pantry for needy students. Read More ||||| A New Type Of Food Pantry Is Sprouting In Yards Across America toggle caption Deborah Shaar/KMUW There's a small-scale charity movement starting to take hold in neighborhoods across the country. Think of those \\"little free library\\" boxes, but with a twist: These are small pantries stocked with free food and personal care items like toothbrushes and diapers for people in need. They're found near churches, outside businesses and in front of homes. Maggie Ballard, who lives in Wichita, Kan., calls hers a \\"blessing box.\\" \\"I felt like this is something that I could do — something small that you know, would benefit so many people so long as the word got out about it,\\" she says. The bright red box is about 2 feet wide and is mounted on a post near the street. Ballard and her son check on it every day and restock as needed. \\"My son is 6 years old, so it gives him a little chore to kind of watch it and see what comes and goes and who comes and goes, and maybe learn a little lesson from it,\\" she says. There's a door on the front of the box but no lock, so anyone can take what they need 24-7. In the beginning, Ballard was providing all of the food. Then word spread and donations from the community starting pouring in. Stacey Schwanke has stopped by with food donations a few times since the box went up in October. \\"We dropped off some breakfast food, some pasta, some sauce, some crackers and some soups,\\" Schwanke says. The food pantry idea has been spreading through social media over the past six months. Ballard's friend built hers after she saw a picture of one on Facebook. Similar \\"yard-based\\" food pantries have gone up across the country, in states like Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, Florida and Minnesota. Much of it seems to trace back to Jessica McClard, who created what she calls the \\"little free pantry\\" in northwest Arkansas. \\"The products that are stocked are put directly inside the pantry and turnover is in about 30 to 45 minutes,\\" McClard says. \\"The frequency of the turnover and the fact that other sites in town are also turning over that frequently, it suggests to me that the need is tremendous.\\" All of the items inside the boxes are free and there are no forms to fill out. Those using the boxes come and go as they wish. And that sense of anonymity is something you won't find at traditional community food pantries. Ballard has seen only a few people using her pantry, because most visitors come when it's dark. \\"Most of the traffic is in the middle of the night, I would say between midnight and 7 in the morning,\\" she says. Ballard says it's both awesome and sad to see the turnover of goods every day. On Christmas Eve she watched as a family of three opened her box to find a bag of bagels and started eating them right there. McClard says these community-supported pantries are multiplying because of their simple concept. \\"We're all short on time and money, and this is a way that people can feel like they are making a difference,\\" she says. The food pantries come in all sizes. Some have religious connections and are located near churches. Others are adopted by businesses whose employees want to pay it forward. All are serving up food and supplies to anyone in need. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The Blessing Box, a miniature food pantry offering free food and essential supplies to the needy, has popped up in neighborhoods across several states in America, including Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, and Minnesota.

Všechny faktory, které formují lidské chování. Translate to English","completion":"All the factors that shape human behavior. Human behavior is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is influenced by a wide range of factors. These factors can be broadly categorized into biological, psychological, and sociocultural determinants. To gain a comprehensive understanding of human behavior, it is necessary to examine the interplay of these factors and their dynamic nature. 1. Biological factors: These are the factors that are related to genetic and physiological aspects of a person. They influence behavior by determining the individual's physical traits, potential abilities, and predispositions. a. Genetics: Genes are the hereditary units that define an individual's characteristics and traits. They play a key role in determining a person's tendencies, abilities, and limitations in various aspects of life. Genetic factors influence various aspects of behavior, such as temperament, intelligence, and physical abilities. b. Brain structure and function: The structure and function of the various parts of the brain play a significant role in shaping human behavior. Different regions of the brain are responsible for different cognitive and emotional processes, and any alterations in these regions can lead to changes in behavior. c. Hormones and neurotransmitters: Hormones and neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells and regulate numerous physiological processes. They play a significant role in modulating a person's mood, motivation, and overall behavior. d. Evolutionary factors: The evolutionary history of humans has also played a role in shaping human behavior. The process of natural selection has led to the development of behavioral tendencies and strategies that have increased the chances of survival and reproduction in our ancestors. 2. Psychological factors: These are factors that are related to an individual's mental processes and emotional experiences. They influence behavior by shaping a person's thoughts, feelings, desires, and attitudes. a. Cognition: Cognitive processes such as perception, memory, attention, and problem-solving influence how an individual interprets and reacts to different situations and experiences. b. Emotions: Emotions have a major impact on human behavior, as they generate specific responses to different stimuli and can also influence decision-making, motivation, and social interactions. c. Personality: Personality traits and characteristics are significant determinants of how a person behaves in various situations. Factors such as introversion, extroversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience affect behavior, interpersonal relationships, and personal preferences. d. Motivation: The level and direction of motivation significantly influence an individual's behavior. Motivation can be intrinsic (stemming from personal interests and values) or extrinsic (driven by external rewards or punishment). 3. Sociocultural factors: These factors encapsulate the influence of cultural, social, and environmental aspects on human behavior. They play a crucial role in determining the norms, values, and expectations that govern behavior in a particular society or group. a. Culture: Cultural norms and values shape an individual's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. They provide a framework for understanding and interpreting the world and can vary significantly across different societies and communities. b. Socialization: The process of socialization involves learning the rules, norms, and expectations of a given society or group. Socialization affects behavior by influencing an individual's beliefs about what is appropriate, normal, or expected. c. Social roles and expectations: The various roles that people play in society, such as parent, child, employee, or friend, often come with specific expectations and norms that can influence behavior. d. Social influences: The presence, opinions, or behavior of others within a social context can significantly impact an individual's behavior. Factors such as conformity, obedience, and social facilitation can either encourage or discourage certain types of behavior. In summary, a combination of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors interact to shape human behavior. Understanding this complex interplay of factors is essential to gain a comprehensive insight into the various aspects that influence the way individuals think, feel, and act in different situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: The influence of what can be seen as in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein? , can you please find it? The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.

The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people. The only explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane. Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. He and Siri are stranded in the middle of nowhere on a cold night.

Answer:","completion":"Michael Burrows is the criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department."},{"prompt":"Information: - Hans Asperger (18 February 1906 21 October 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named... - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650,000 people. Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Hans Asperger ( February 18 , 1906 -- October 21 , 1980 ) was an Austrian pediatrician , medical theorist , and medical professor . He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders , especially in children . His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna , and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously . There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s , and due to his earlier work which was regarded by many to be under the fold of autism spectrum disorders , was named after him . Both Asperger 's original paediatric diagnosis of autistic psychopathy ( AP ) , and the eponymous diagnosis of Asperger syndrome ( AS ) that was named for him after his death , remain controversial in competing diagnostic criteria . - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior. - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10. - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children... - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\", Fifth Edition (DSM-5\\") is the 2013 update to the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance. - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Some sunspots are tough to remove and don’t respond well to OTC creams and other products. If you’d like to remove or lighten the sunspots for cosmetic reasons, visit a local dermatologist and ask them to inspect your sunspots. Describe to them how long you’ve had the sunspots and mention what other treatments you’ve tried. In some cases, you may need to visit your general practitioner first and get a referral to a dermatologist. Laser resurfacing can be done at a doctor’s office or hospital. The procedure entails removing upper layers of your skin (which include the unwanted sunspots) with beams of light. Laser resurfacing is expensive—since it’s typically not covered by insurance—but effective in removing sunspots by taking off thin layers of skin. Recovery time can take up to 3 weeks. You’ll be mildly sedated during the procedure itself. It’s an outpatient procedure, though, so you’ll be dismissed from the doctor’s office or the hospital after it’s done. Before going ahead with the procedure, the doctor will ask you about your medical history and any prescription medications you’re taking. This will help the doctor confirm that the patches are, in fact, sunspots and aren’t caused by another skin condition. If your doctor agrees that a chemical peel will help remove your sunspots, they’ll apply a mild acid to your face. This treated layer of skin—which typically contains the unwanted sunspots—will peel off, allowing fresh new skin to grow in its place. Peels can be performed at some dermatologist offices or at hospitals. The procedure can leave the affected area red for several days. The procedure can cause some lingering pain, so your doctor may suggest you take OTC pain medication or use a cold compress for a week. If you’d rather not treat your entire face but would prefer to focus only on removing sunspots, cryotherapy may be the way to go. When performing this procedure, doctors typically use nitrous oxide to freeze the sunspots. The spots will then scab and fall off in approximately 1 week, leaving un-darkened skin behind. Microdermabrasion is a fairly aggressive way to treat sunspots, so make sure to check with your doctor before having the treatment performed. In the procedure, a doctor will use a special applicator to remove the outermost layer of your skin. This will remove sunspots and leave fresh skin behind. Some doctors will perform the procedure at their office, while others will refer you to a local hospital. Fortunately, the procedure isn’t painful and can be done in 60 minutes. Your skin may feel tight or slightly stretched after the microdermabrasion. If this bothers you, take a dose of OTC pain medication.","completion":"This article discusses various methods such as laser resurfacing, chemical peels, cryotherapy, and microdermabrasion to remove or lighten stubborn sunspots under the guidance of a dermatologist or at specialized facilities, while highlighting their effectiveness, costs, and recovery times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the fact that: As you increase the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly increases. Answer the question: A hydrocarbon that doubles its carbon atoms will cause an decrease or increase in the amount of isomers? The answer is:","completion":"An increase in the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will lead to an increase in the number of possible isomers. This relationship can be better understood by examining the nature of hydrocarbons and isomers, as well as the reasons behind this phenomenon. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. These compounds can either be saturated, such as alkanes with single covalent bonds between carbon atoms, or unsaturated, such as alkenes and alkynes with double or triple covalent bonds between carbon atoms, respectively. The structural arrangement of carbon and hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon gives rise to different forms of the same compound known as isomers. Isomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of their atoms. They can be broadly classified into two categories: structural isomers (also known as constitutional isomers) and stereoisomers. Structural isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different bonding patterns between their atoms, while stereoisomers have the same bonding patterns but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. The number of isomers generally increases with the increase in carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon because more carbon atoms provide a greater number of potential bonding sites, yielding a higher number of possible structural arrangements. Furthermore, with more carbons in the chain, there are more opportunities for the formation of branched structures, leading to more structural isomer possibilities. For instance, an alkane with two carbon atoms, ethane (C2H6), has only one possible structural arrangement, with no isomers. In contrast, an alkane with four carbon atoms, butane (C4H10), has two possible structural isomers: n-butane and isobutane. As the number of carbon atoms increases, the number of possible isomers follows a similar pattern. This phenomenon can be observed in the following examples: - Pentane (C5H12) has three structural isomers. - Hexane (C6H14) has five structural isomers. - Heptane (C7H16) has nine structural isomers. Additionally, more carbon atoms also increase the possibility of forming different stereoisomers, particularly in unsaturated hydrocarbons like alkenes. Therefore, when you double the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, you can expect an increase in the number of isomers, both structural and stereoisomers, a fact that can be attributed to the increased number of potential bonding sites and the greater opportunity for the formation of branched structures within the hydrocarbon."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what causes thunder sound Suggested answer: In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom , which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a clap, crack, or peal of thunder.

Long island was full of people and they used all their natural resources and burned fossil fuels while Snail island protected the environment and had fewer people living there. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island contributed more to global warming? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is apparent that Long Island contributed more to global warming compared to Snail Island. The reasons attributing to this conclusion are as follows: 1. Population Density: Long Island is described as being \\"full of people,\\" suggesting a higher population density. A higher population density often results in increased energy consumption, waste production, and pollution. On the other hand, Snail Island has fewer people living there, meaning it has a lower population density and likely a reduced overall environmental impact. 2. Resource Usage: Long Island is described as using all of its natural resources. Over-exploitation and unsustainable use of natural resources can result in deforestation, loss of biodiversity, depletion of water sources, and soil degradation. These processes can exacerbate global warming by reducing the natural capacity for carbon sequestration and altering ecosystems' balance. In contrast, Snail Island protected the environment, indicating the responsible and sustainable use of its natural resources. 3. Energy Production: The burning of fossil fuels is a significant factor contributing to global warming. Long Island relied on the combustion of fossil fuels, which results in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming. It is not mentioned that Snail Island used fossil fuels for energy production. Instead, Snail Island's efforts to protect the environment could imply the adoption of cleaner, alternative energy sources, contributing less to global warming. Taking the above factors into consideration, it is evident that Long Island's higher population density, unsustainable use of natural resources, and reliance on fossil fuels for energy resulted in a more significant contribution to global warming than Snail Island. Meanwhile, Snail Island's focus on environmental protection likely led to the responsible use of resources and adoption of cleaner energy solutions, making it a lesser contributor to global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Lay down a protective covering such as newspaper or a plastic sheet to prevent staining the surface below your project. Step 3: Create the blood color Mix red and a small amount of black acrylic paint on a plate or palette to create a dark red, blood-like color. Adjust the ratio of red to black as needed until you achieve the desired hue. Step 4: Test the color Before applying the paint to the doll, test the color on a piece of paper or another disposable surface to ensure the hue and consistency are appropriate. Step 5: Apply the paint Using a small paintbrush, apply the paint mixture to the desired areas of the doll where blood would realistically appear. Think about how blood might splatter, drip, or pool depending on the doll's position and any implied injuries. Step 6: Create texture To make the blood appear more realistic, dab a sponge or cloth into the paint and dab it lightly onto the doll, creating a stippled, uneven texture. You can also use the edge of the sponge to create streaks, as if blood has smeared or been wiped away. Step 7: Layering and drying Allow the paint to dry slightly between layers to create depth and variation in color. Feel free to add more paint if needed to achieve the desired effect. Remember that acrylic paint tends to dry darker, so take that into consideration when layering. Step 8: Cleanup While waiting for the paint to dry, clean up your workspace and rinse your paintbrush and sponge with water. Dispose of any used paper towels, newspapers, or plastic sheets as necessary. Step 9: Seal (optional) If desired, once the paint is completely dry, you can apply a clear sealant spray or paint-on varnish to protect the paint and give it a glossy, wet appearance.

Question: What does the telegrams notify? Movie title: We Were Soldiers Movie plot: A French Army unit is on patrol in pre-Vietnam IndoChina in July 1954 during the First Indochina War. The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam, Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:\\"Look around you, in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine, another from Puerto Rico, we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indian, Jews and Gentiles, all American.

Article:The choice of sites was driven largely by operational considerations - they are places engineers believe a lander can get down with the least risk. No-one has attempted to land on a 10-billion-tonne comet before. The Rosetta probe will despatch its Philae contact robot to 67P's icy surface on 11 November. The European Space Agency says it will be a one-shot opportunity. Rosetta and the comet are currently about 400 million km from Earth, making real-time radio control impossible. Instead, the process will have to be fully automated with commands uploaded several days in advance. The five sites on the \\"longlist\\" were selected at the end of a special meeting convened in Toulouse, France, this past weekend. Esa project managers were joined by attendees from the space agencies of France (Cnes) and Germany (DLR), which play key roles in the Philae effort. Instrument principal investigators on the washing machine-sized robot were also there to argue their preferences, as were the engineers, who could explain the technical possibilities. If one considers the comet to look like a rubber duck, then three of the chosen potentials (B, I and J) are on the head. Two are on the body (A and C). The dramatic neck region has been ruled out. The letter designation stems from an even longer list of 10 that was used to kick-off the whole selection process. The letter ordering carries no weight. A landing site needs to be relatively flat and free from boulders and fissures. One key requirement has been the need to find places on the comet that experience something of a day/night cycle. This will give not only a better appreciation of the changing behaviour of 67P under all conditions, but will provide the lander with some important protection - from too much sun, which could lead to overheating, or too little light, which would make it difficult to charge the batteries. The engineers have also emphasised the need to find locations where Rosetta can deliver Philae at the right altitude and velocity, and maintain a communications link throughout the descent, which is likely to take several hours. The longlist will be reduced to a leading candidate and perhaps a couple of back-ups in mid-September. A final go/no-go decision on a target landing site is expected by mid-October. By then, Rosetta's cameras and other instruments will have returned detailed data on the number one choice. Comet 67P has very little gravitational attraction - several hundred thousand times weaker than what Philae would experience at the Earth's surface. For this reason, it will touch down at no more than a walking pace - about 1m/s. It will use harpoons and ice screws to try to hang on to the comet and avoid bouncing back into space.

This comet, named 67P, is very far away from Earth, so they have to be really careful when choosing the right spot for the robot to land. They made a list of five \\"safe\\" spots where they think Philae can land without too many problems. The scientists need to choose a spot that is flat and not too rocky, so the robot can land safely. They also need a spot with the right amount of sunlight, so the robot doesn't get too hot or have trouble charging its batteries. The robot, Philae, will be dropped from another spacecraft called Rosetta when it tries to land on the comet. In a couple of months, they will decide which landing spot they like the most based on the information they get from Rosetta's cameras and instruments. When Philae finally lands on the comet, it will move very slowly and use special tools like harpoons and ice screws to grab onto the comet and not bounce back into space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the trains are moving in the same direction, we can find the relative speed by subtracting the speed of the slower train from the speed of the faster train. Relative speed = (46 km/hr) - (36 km/hr) = 10 km/hr Step 2: Convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. To convert the speed from km/hr to m/s, we multiply the speed by (1000 m/km) and divide by (3600 s/hr). Relative speed = (10 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = (10 * 1000) / 3600 m/s = 10000/3600 m/s = 25/9 m/s Step 3: Determine the distance the faster train travels relative to the slower train while passing it. Since the faster train takes 54 seconds to pass the slower one, we can find the distance it travels relative to the slower train by multiplying the relative speed by the time it takes to pass. Distance = (Relative speed) * (Time) Distance = (25/9 m/s) * (54 s) Step 4: Calculate the distance. Distance = (25/9 m/s) * (54 s) = (25 * 54) / 9 m = 1350 / 9 m = 150 m Step 5: Determine the length of each train. Since the distance covered by the faster train while passing the slower train is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two trains (because they are of equal length), we can find the length of each train by dividing the distance by 2. Length of each train = Distance / 2 = 150 m / 2 = 75 m Answer: The length of each train is 75 m, which corresponds to Option C."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Governor Jerry Brown signed the \\"yes means yes\\" bill, which advocates say will change the perception of rape. The legislation stipulates that voluntary agreement, rather than lack of resistance, defines consent. In January President Obama launched an initiative to combat sexual assault, particularly on college campuses. \\"Yes means yes\\" is the first law in a US state to make the language of affirmative consent a central principle of school sexual assault policies. The rule defines consent as \\"an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.\\" Lawmakers say, however, that consent can be non-verbal, if it is unambiguous. The aim is to improve the way that campuses deal with accusations of sexual assault, and to challenge the notion that victims of sexual crimes need to have resisted assault in order to have valid complaints. The legislation also says that silence or a lack of resistance do not constitute consent. Under the bill, someone who is drunk, drugged, unconscious or asleep cannot grant consent. Sofie Karasek, an activist from the University of California-Berkeley told San Jose Mercury News that she believed the bill would change the cultural perception of rape. \\"There's this pervasive idea that if it's not super violent then it doesn't really count,\\" she said. However critics say that the new law dangerously expands the definition of assault. The National Coalition For Men condemned the bill as \\"misandric\\" (man-hating), saying it \\"gives license to false accusations, denies the accused due process, will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in law suits and sets the stage for ruining innocent lives.\\" The Department of Education has named dozens of colleges and universities under investigation for mishandling sexual assault cases. The US estimates one in five women is sexually assaulted while at university.","completion":"Governor Jerry Brown signed the \\"yes means yes\\" bill into law, introducing affirmative consent as a central principle in school sexual assault policies, aiming to improve how campuses handle accusations and challenge the notion that sexual crime victims must have resisted assault for valid complaints."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Gary Hake, 35, discovered he could dribble tea out of a hole in his chin after cutting it during a game of football. As a keen footballer, it is no surprise that Gary Hake is good at dribbling - but not in quite the way you might imagine. When the burly teacher cut his chin during a football game, it reopened an old wound and, as he sat in hospital waiting to be patched up, he discovered he could dribble tea out of the hole. Rather than chasing the doctors to take a look at him, the 35-year-old from Chatham, Kent, decided to video his unusual new trick, before posting the horrifying footage online. Mr Hake, a father of two, was hit in the face as he jumped for a header during a game with his team, Sheppey and Sheerness United FC, on Saturday. He said: 'I remember jumping up for a header and then I’m not entirely sure what happened. 'I don’t know if it was an elbow or what but the next thing I remember is coming down in a bit of a daze with blood everywhere.' The accident reopened an old wound, but Mr Hake plugged the bleeding hole below his lip with Vaseline and played on for 10 minutes before he was taken to Sheppey Community Hospital. Waiting to be seen, he discovered he could spurt tea from the hole, and asked his niece to film it on her mobile phone. She then posted the gruesome footage on Facebook. Mr Hake said: 'The accident opened up a wound from about nine years ago, although this time itw as a lot worse. 'When I did it nine years ago, I thought about doing the thing with the tea then, so this time I thought I’m not going to miss the opportunity to do it this time. 'I didn’t hurt. I think it helped clean it out a bit.' Mr Hake, who had two stitches to the wound, retired from football last year after 30 years of games but was persuaded to sign up again at the start of the season.

The news came as a UN envoy met President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi on Monday in the southern city of Aden. The conflict between the Houthis and the government escalated in March 2015. The coalition intervened militarily in an attempt to restore the internationally-recognised administration after Mr Hadi was forced to flee the country. Since then, \\"the estimates are that over 10,000 people have been killed in this conflict and almost 40,000 people injured\\", UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Yemen Jamie McGoldrick told reporters in the capital Sanaa on Monday. He did not provide a breakdown between civilians and combatants. However, a UN report said community-level human rights monitors had reported 11,332 civilian casualties, including 4,125 killed, by the end of October 2016. Mr McGoldrick also said seven million people living in areas directly affected by the fighting were facing severe food shortages. UN envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, meanwhile sought to persuade the government to agree to a new cessation of hostilities and to resume peace talks with the Houthis and their ally, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He was expected to present an amended roadmap for a political solution to the conflict, after Mr Hadi rejected one that would have seen his powers reduced in favour of a new vice-president who would oversee the formation of an interim government and a transition to elections. \\"The current political stalemate is causing death and destruction every day,\\" Mr Ould Cheikh Ahmed said in a statement. \\"A peace agreement, including a well-articulated security plan and the formation of an inclusive government, is the only way to end the war that has fuelled the development of terrorism in Yemen and the region,\\" he added. \\"I asked the president to act swiftly and engage constructively with the UN's proposal for the sake of the country's future.\\" Mr Ould Cheikh Ahmed is due to report to the UN Security Council later this month.

Write an article with the title: \\"America’s growing love affair with the most wasteful thing to drink there is\\"","completion":"Title: America’s Growing Love Affair With The Most Wasteful Thing To Drink There Is Introduction In a world that's increasingly becoming more concerned with sustainability, conservation, and the consequences of our consumption on the environment, America's love affair with one of the most wasteful things to drink seems to show no sign of abating. This drink, which has pervaded our lives in various forms, is bottled water. Americans consume an astonishing volume of this product, which contributes to the draining of natural resources, the creation of enormous amounts of plastic waste, and carbon emissions involved in its production and transportation. Understanding the Appeal of Bottled Water The abundance of bottled water in various forms is remarkable. From sleek designer bottles to affordable single-use plastic bottles, there's something for everyone. And for many, the appeal is obvious. Most people believe that bottled water is cleaner, healthier, and tastier than tap water. Couple this perception with convenience and bottled water becomes the beverage of choice for millions of Americans. However, studies have repeatedly debunked the myth that bottled water is significantly cleaner or healthier than tap water. In fact, in most cases, tap water is tested and regulated to similar or even higher standards than bottled water. Considering that tap water is available at a fraction of the cost of bottled water, this raises the question: why are Americans so willing to pay a premium for bottled water? The Marketing of Bottled Water The answer to this question lies in the power of marketing and branding. Bottled water companies have been incredibly successful in promoting their products as the embodiment of healthy and safe water consumption. Advertisements featuring pristine mountain springs, picturesque rivers, and crystal-clear waterfalls create an image of ultimate purity. This image contrasts dramatically with news stories about contaminated tap water and crumbling infrastructure, creating the illusion that purchasing bottled water is the responsible choice. Meanwhile, some bottled water brands tout the supposed benefits of enhanced or flavored water, promising improved hydration, increased energy, and other health benefits. These claims often stretch the truth, but they attract consumers who are drawn to the idea of putting something ostensibly \\"better\\" into their bodies. The Environmental and Social Cost Unfortunately, the environmental and social costs of our addiction to bottled water are substantial. The production of a single plastic water bottle consumes approximately three times the amount of water it holds. Moreover, the extraction of water sources for bottling has led to water depletion, dry riverbeds, and declining groundwater levels, exacerbating the global water crisis that affects millions of people. Additionally, around 80% of plastic bottles end up in landfills, where they take up to 1,000 years to decompose. The United States alone contributes to about 38 billion plastic bottles to landfills annually. A significant number of these bottles end up polluting our oceans, affecting marine ecosystems, and entering the food chain. Energy consumption in the bottled water industry is another important concern. It is estimated that the production and transportation of bottled water in the United States releases around 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide yearly, further contributing to climate change. A Future Without Bottled Water This bleak portrait of bottled water consumption raises an even more critical question: how can we break America's destructive love affair with wasteful drinks? A strong starting point involves raising awareness about the real costs of consuming bottled water, as well as debunking the myth that it is inherently cleaner and healthier than tap water. Initiatives promoting tap water infrastructure improvements, investing in water quality testing, and providing practical alternatives to single-use bottles (e.g., reusable bottles and public water fountains) can create long-lasting impacts. Encouraging a conscious, informed approach to water consumption and reducing our reliance on single-use plastics can help steer America towards a more sustainable future. Conclusion America's love affair with bottled water puts a significant strain on the environment and perpetuates misinformation about the safety and quality of tap water. Now more than ever, it is essential to break away from this wasteful and damaging habit, embracing solutions that prioritize the health of both people and the planet. Greater awareness and collective action could help quench America's thirst without causing harm to our shared environment and precious resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the following review positive or negative? Great Mexican food bang for the buck (or should I say peso) My daughter and I dropped in during the Madison Art Fair on the Square. We were headed to Chipotle, but after seeing some great Yelp reviews, we diverted off State Street to try this little hole in the wall taqueria on Gilman Street. Unless you're a big fan of formica, the decor barely rates one star, we're talking dive with a capital D. The place could use a real thorough cleaning as well. Our tabletop was a sticky, but with a napkin, some water and a lot of elbow grease, our eating space became acceptable. The flat screen on the wall featured the Mexican version of MTV which kept my 10 year old very entertained with the plot development of each video. (Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is sad) The laminated menu contained primarily Mexican food truck fare (tacos, gorditas, burritos, tostadas, etc.) As a fan of the late, great Up and In podcast, I was overjoyed to see Boing! as one of the beverage options along with Jarritos and horchata. But with ala cart prices from 2 to 3 for many of the items, it encouraged us to sample a variety of items. The cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter was a revelation. Rather than your standard thin layer of shredded jack cheese pressed between a couple of tortillas, this baby featured a crispy masa pocket crammed full of melted queso fresco cheese. She quickly wolfed it down and ordered a second one, proclaiming this version to be far superior to what she's consumed at Pasqual's or Chipotle. I ordered a steak taco, a pork gordita and a chorizo & potato sopes. The steak taco came in a double corn tortilla topped with finely chopped onions, queso fresco and cilantro. Unlike the pungent onions that plagued a recent meal at La Mestiza, these onions were fresher and the smaller dice complimented the meaty goodness of this taco. The steak was well seasoned and perfectly prepared. The pastor gordita, which had the same masa exterior as the quesadilla was also a culinary delight. The crispy exterior was a perfect foil to the melt in your mouth goodness of the pork filling.

Experts say so far there is no reason to worry, and point out that we meet radiation every day. Where and how? NPR's Renee Montagne posed that question to Peter Caracappa, a radiation safety officer and professor of nuclear engineering. MONTAGNE: How many things emit radiation? Dr CARACAPPA: Well, radiation and radioactive material is a part of nature. So everything that's living has some amount of radiation coming from it--a very small amout. Plus there's radiation in the ground and the air. So the extremes are uranium in the soil to bananas? Yes. By the way, why do bananas have radiation? Bananas have a lot of potassium . And a small amount of potassium naturally is called potassium 40, which is radioactive What's the difference between radiation that's harmful and not harmful? Well, the term radiation can apply to a lot of different things. But the harmful radiation is ionizing radiation. It has enough energy that it can make chemical changes in material. We could get ionizing radiation from an X-ray, for example. It's the kind of radiation that causes cancer. The broader definition of radiation includes a lot of things that we call non-ionizing radiation. That includes everything like radio waves and visible light and your microwave. So what then is the largest contributor of ionizing radiation? For the natural sources of ionizing radiation, actually the biggest chunk of that tends to come from radon , which is a radioactive material that is present in the air. It can become a concern when it builds up in low-lying areas of homes like basements. Would it be fair to say that most people do not need to worry about the danger of being exposed to radiation? I would say that the everyday exposure to radioation that we meet contributes an extremely tiny risk to our life or to our health compared to all of the other risks that we meet in our day-to-day life. A:","completion":"Based on the article, which of the following is a source of ionizing radiation that people might encounter daily?

Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places such as Saint-Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774, raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \\"popery.\\" The Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution. What did the British think would remain French?","completion":"From the historical account you've provided, it appears that the British might have thought that New Orleans would remain French. The mention of Acadians who moved to New Orleans, anticipating that it would remain under French control, suggests that this expectation might have been shared by the British as well. However, the British control over French territories in North America was a result of various conflicts and treaties, especially the Treaty of Paris of 1763 that ended the Seven Years' War. The territories that each European power controlled in North America shifted numerous times based on the outcomes of these conflicts and peace settlements. The historical context suggests that the British might have allowed certain French territories like New Orleans to remain French as part of their strategic considerations, diplomatic bargainings, or to maintain a balance of power. However, eventually, through a series of historical events and treaties, New Orleans also came under the control of the Spanish, then back to the French, and finally was acquired by the United States through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In conclusion, it could be inferred that the British, at some point, might have perceived New Orleans to remain French due to various strategic and diplomatic considerations. However, the scenario was dynamic and changed with the complex unfolding of events in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in North America."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, John, the farmer who practiced organic farming and produced organic milk, had fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens on his farm. This is because organic farming practices do not permit the use of antibiotics as a preventative measure, which leads to a lower prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens on organic farms.

Plot title: 300: Battle of Artemisia Movie plot: Note: this film is actually a prequel as well as a sequel to the original '300' film (with the events happening before, concurrently, and after the events of the previous film).In the opening scene, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) narrates about King Darius (Igal Naor) leading his army of Persians into Greece in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.Artemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid.

However, numerous challenges lie ahead for the former Netherlands national team manager as he begins his journey with a club hungry for success after a disappointing last season under David Moyes. Van Gaal's Arrival Louis van Gaal arrives at Old Trafford with an impressive managerial resume, having managed top European clubs like Ajax, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich, winning numerous domestic league titles and the UEFA Champions League. The Red Devils have placed their trust in him to restore their lost glory and rebuild the team, which requires overcoming some daunting challenges - starting with a slew of injuries to key players. Injury Setbacks As Manchester United prepare for their opening fixture, they would be without several important players such as Luke Shaw, Robin van Persie, Michael Carrick, Danny Welbeck, and Jonny Evans, who are all ruled out due to match fitness or injuries. Luke Shaw, the promising left-back signed from Southampton, has been denied his debut as he is recovering from a hamstring injury. This presents Van Gaal with the challenge of finding an immediate replacement in the absence of his first-choice left-back for the upcoming game. Robin van Persie, a crucial part of Van Gaal's plans, is still short of match fitness after playing in the 2014 FIFA World Cup with the Netherlands, while key midfielder Michael Carrick and attacker Danny Welbeck are also ruled out, leaving the team without valuable experience and versatility on the field. Additionally, center-back Jonny Evans would be a significant miss in the defense for the Red Devils, as he was expected to play a major role in Van Gaal's formation for the upcoming season. Swansea's Hopes for a Repeat Performance Amid the injury concerns and fitness issues for Manchester United, Swansea City would be hoping to capitalize on the situation and once again pull off a shock victory at Old Trafford, just like they did during last season's FA Cup third round. Swansea manager Garry Monk has reasons to be optimistic, as he welcomes back the pacey wingers Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge to his squad. Their return to action would certainly boost the team's confidence and increase their chances of causing another upset at the Theatre of Dreams. Conclusion Louis van Gaal faces a baptism of fire in his first game as Manchester United manager, grappling with multiple injuries and fitness concerns for key players. Despite the challenges, Van Gaal will aim to make a quick impact and lay the foundation for a successful campaign ahead. As much as Van Gaal needs to find the winning formula, the pressure is on the players to respond to his tactics and prove their mettle in the competitive world of Premier League football. The upcoming fixture will be a crucial test for both the manager and his squad, setting the tone for the rest of the season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard.

Answer the following question: what is the name of the drawings created as part of a storyboard?","completion":"Storyboard drawings, also known as storyboarding, is a crucial aspect of pre-production in film, television, animation, video game design, and other visual storytelling mediums. The drawings created as part of a storyboard are generally referred to as \\"storyboard panels,\\" \\"storyboard sketches,\\" or simply \\"frames.\\" Storyboard panels bring the script to life in visual form – they illustrate the narrative trajectory of a project. These drawings depict the sequence of events in a story, often including details about camera angles, lighting, character movement, and dialogue. They share a resemblance to comic strips, as both use sequential images to illustrate a narrative flow. Storyboard sketches may vary in their degree of detail based on the stage they are in or the individual artist's methods. In an early \\"rough\\" stage, these might have minimal detail, mainly focusing on depicting major elements of a scene and the broad composition. As the process advances, storyboard artists usually add more details, clarifying camera movements, character expressions, and scene specifics the director or other team members may need to understand the planned shot or scene fully. In animation and some other media, there are also \\"animatics,\\" which are a series of storyboard panels edited together with the rough dialogue and some basic sound effects, to provide a closer approximation of the final product before investing more deeply into production. To sum up, the drawings created as part of a storyboard are called storyboard panels or frames. These sketches are essentially a visual guide that organizes the sequence of a story, helping to visualize the screenplay or script before going into production. They provide a visual layout of events as they are to be seen through the camera lens, serving as a roadmap for the entire production team to understand the vision of the director or the screenwriter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population called? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population. Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, the term evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. Using the ABO blood type system as an example, the frequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of [1] copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in Jordan found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent. The IB and I0 alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population. The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread than others during the process of natural selection. Natural selection can alter the population’s genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the population. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population. Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur... Choices: - allele commonness - trait frequency - allele rarity - allele frequecy A: A:","completion":"allele frequency"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday.

He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

Answer: Powered by a DOHC , water-cooled , four-cylinder inline engine with four carburetors , the engine capacity was increased to 606 cc from the S500 's 531 cc. Question: what was the first honda car The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the Honda S600 is not the first Honda car. While the Honda S600 is an important model in the history of Honda, it was not their first car. The first Honda car was the Honda T360, a small pick-up truck introduced in June 1963. The T360 was followed by the Honda S500, a small sports car introduced in October 1963. These two vehicles marked Honda's entry into the automobile market. Honda, a company known today for its reliable and innovative vehicles, began with a focus on motorcycles. Soichiro Honda, the founder, embarked on his dream of producing cars to diversify his company and grow. Honda released the T360, which featured a small, 356cc four-stroke engine that produced around 30 horsepower. Although it was a pickup truck, it set the stage for the company to progress into car manufacturing. Following the T360, Honda introduced the S500, which showcased the company's prowess in vehicle design and engineering. It was a two-door roadster that featured a 531cc four-cylinder DOHC engine, and it marked Honda's first step into the sports car category. The engine design was heavily influenced by Honda's experience in motorcycle engines, featuring a high-revving and innovative chain-driven system for the engine camshaft. The S500 also featured independent suspension on all four wheels, a first for a Japanese car at that time. After the S500, Honda continued to expand upon its sports car lineup, introducing the S600 in 1964, which was an evolution of the S500. Powered by a DOHC, water-cooled, four-cylinder inline engine with four carburetors, the engine capacity was increased to 606cc from the S500's 531cc. This allowed the S600 to produce more power and achieve higher speeds. The S600 was available as both a convertible and a fastback coupé, and its unique design and advanced technological features helped establish Honda's reputation as a high-quality automaker. In summary, the Honda S600, while significant in the company's history, was not the first Honda car. That title goes to the Honda T360, a small pick-up truck introduced in 1963. The first sports car from Honda was the S500, also introduced in 1963, and it served as the predecessor to the S600."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Due to historically close ties with France, French literature came to constitute the major Western influence on Ottoman literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of Romanticism can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the Realist and Naturalist movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the Symbolist and Parnassian movements that became paramount.

I separated the egg yolk and the egg white.","completion":"Yes, the given sentence, \\"I separated the egg yolk and the egg white,\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Here's a breakdown of why this sentence works in terms of syntax (structure) and semantics (meaning). Syntax: The sentence is composed of a subject (\\"I\\"), a transitive verb (\\"separated\\"), and a direct object (\\"the egg yolk and the egg white\\"). The subject is the person or thing performing the action. In this case, \\"I\\" is the subject. The transitive verb is the action being performed, which is \\"separated\\" in this sentence. A transitive verb requires a direct object, the recipient of the action. In this instance, the direct object is \\"the egg yolk and the egg white.\\" The conjunction \\"and\\" links the two noun phrases \\"the egg yolk\\" and \\"the egg white,\\" creating a compound direct object. Overall, the sentence follows the subject-verb-object structure, which is grammatically correct and syntactically acceptable in English. Semantics: The sentence is also semantically acceptable, meaning that it conveys a coherent and meaningful idea. The action of \\"separating\\" can be logically applied to \\"the egg yolk and the egg white,\\" as these are two distinct components of an egg. Separating the yolk and the white is a common culinary technique used in various recipes to achieve different textures or to isolate specific nutrients. Thus, the concept of separating egg yolks and egg whites is readily understood and conveys a clear, meaningful message. In conclusion, the sentence \\"I separated the egg yolk and the egg white\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable as it follows the standard structure and conveys a coherent message with proper word usage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: \\"People should have one meat-free day a week if they want to make a personal and effective sacrifice that would help deal with climate change,\\" the world's leading authority on global warming has told The Observer. Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that people should then go on to reduce their meat consumption even further. Pachauri, who was re-elected the panel's chairman for a second six-year term last week, said diet change was important because of the huge greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental problems associated with raising cattle and other animals. \\"It was relatively easy to change eating habits compared to changing means of transport,\\" he said. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. These are produced during the production. For example, ruminants , particularly cows, give off a gas called methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than CO2. Pachauri can expect some opposite responses from the food industry to his advice, though last night he was given unexpected support by Masterchef presenter and restaurateur John Torode. \\"I have a little bit and enjoy it,\\" said Torode. \\"Too much for any person is bad.

Summarize this article: Kingfisher, which owns B&Q and Screwfix in the UK and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, said retail profits for the quarter fell 6.6% to Â£223m. Underlying UK and Ireland sales were up 4.6%, but rose just 0.1% in France. Currency swings, including the weakening of the euro against the pound, took Â£17m off profits. \\"Q3 trading conditions have followed a similar trend to the first half of the year, reflecting the more encouraging macroeconomic backdrop in the UK offset by a softer market in France,\\" said chief executive Veronique Laury. Earlier this year, Kingfisher said it would close 60 B&Q stores. However, it is increasing the number of Screwfix stores, where sales have been growing much faster. Like-for-like sales at B&Q were up 2.4% in the three months to the end of October, while Screwfix sales jumped 13.3%. However, the weaker housing market in France affected sales there. Castorama sales slipped 0.2% on a like-for-like basis, although they rose 0.4% at Brico Depot. \\"Today's update from Kingfisher highlights a typically mixed bag of results,\\" said David Alexander, consultant at retail analysts Conlumino. \\"While it is making progress in the UK, amid an improving consumer context, sales in France were disappointing, with the group drawing attention to the slow growth of house building across the Channel as a key factor underpinning its lacklustre performance.\\" He said it was still \\"early days\\" for Ms Laury's new strategy for Kingfisher, but added: \\"Given the difficulties B&Q continues to face in adapting to the new shape of DIY demand and the unfavourable economic climate in France, progress so far has been acceptable.\\"","completion":"Kingfisher, the UK-based international home improvement company, has reported a 6.6% decrease in its Q3 retail profits, dropping to £223m. Factors such as the fluctuating currency market and in particular, the weakening of euro against the pound, are reported to have deducted £17m from their profits. Moreover, while the company has seen a 4.6% boost in underlying sales in the UK and Ireland, it has only observed a marginal 0.1% growth in France. The CEO of Kingfisher, Veronique Laury, noted that the Q3 trading environment has followed the trends seen in H1, encouraging macroeconomic conditions in the UK were counterbalanced by a softer French market. The company disclosed plans this year to close 60 B&Q stores. However, it plans to expand the number of Screwfix stores, which have been recording faster sales growth. Comparable sales for B&Q improved by 2.4% over the three months ending in October, whereas, Screwfix sales skyrocketed by 13.3%. However, the dampened housing market in France has put a dent in their sales. Castorama, one of Kingfisher's entities in France, has seen a 0.2% dip in sales on a comparable basis, though sales for Brico Depot, its other French outlet, rose by 0.4%. David Alexander, a consultant at retail analysts Conlumino, pointed out that while Kingfisher has shown progress in the UK in an encouraging consumer context, French sales have been less than stellar. Stagnant growth in house building across France has been identified as a key factor affecting Kingfisher's overall performance. Alexander also noted that even though it's still the starting stages of CEO Laury's new strategy for Kingfisher, the modest progress made so far is acceptable considering the headwinds B&Q is facing in adapting to new trends in consumer demands in the DIY sector and the challenging economic climate in France."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -269*k = -266*k + 6 for k, we first need to isolate k on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll follow these steps: 1. Subtract -266*k from both sides of the equation: -269*k - (-266*k) = -266*k + 6 - (-266*k) Since subtracting a negative value is the same as adding its positive counterpart, the equation becomes: -269*k + 266*k = 6 2. Combine the k terms on the left side of the equation: (-269 + 266)*k = 6 -3*k = 6 3. Divide both sides of the equation by -3 to solve for k: k = 6 / (-3) 4.

You are presented with the question \\"what are basal bodies involved in?\\" and the following answer choices: - Plants growth - cell division - an organism's body - root growth - movement - permineralization - Animal survival - animal transport Now knowing that centrioles are organelles involved in cell division and basal bodies function as centrioles, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Cell division. To understand the role of basal bodies, it is instrumental to first grasp the functioning of centrioles as the two structures are intricately connected in their purposes within a cell. Centrioles represent key cell organelles, found in the majority of eukaryotic species (except higher plants and few other organisms). They are cylindrical structures which primarily participate in organizing the cell's microtubules, a function which is integral to cell division. In the process of cell division, centrioles aid in the formation of the spindle apparatus, which is necessary for the chromosomes to move to the daughter cells. Without this function, the cell division process would not take place efficiently or correctly. Basal bodies and centrioles share a lot of structural and compositional similarities. In fact, basal bodies are essentially centrioles that have migrated to the cell periphery to nucleate and anchor cilia or flagella. Cilia and flagella are slender threadlike structures that protrude from the cell body and help in cell movement. However, more pertinent to this answer is that basal bodies share the cell division role with centrioles due to their structural similarity and composition. When not involved with cilia or flagella, they function as centrioles and participate in cell division. Therefore, the function of basal bodies is not notably involved in functions like plant or root growth, permineralization (the process of fossil formation), animal survival or animal transport (unless if by this is meant cell movement mediated by cilia or flagella). Although basal bodies (through their function in flagella or cilia) could influence an organism's body movement, this function is not their primary role. Hence, with our knowledge that basal bodies act as centrioles contributing to cell division, it is inferred that the most appropriate answer among the proposed choices is 'cell division'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Walkin' is not a standard-length album.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis that Walkin' is not a standard-length album appears to be true. To support this claim, we must consider the following details provided in the paragraph: 1. Walkin' is described as a \\"debut mini-album\\" by South Korean singer Suran. The term \\"mini-album\\" suggests that it is a smaller collection of songs compared to a standard-length album. Mini-albums, also known as EPs (Extended Plays), typically contain fewer tracks than a standard album, which often has 10 to 14 songs. 2. The release of Walkin' occurred on June 2, 2017, by Million Market and distributed by LOEN Entertainment. While this detail doesn't directly confirm the hypothesis, it provides context and credibility to the paragraph's other claims. 3. Walkin' consists of five songs, including \\"Wine\\" featuring rapper Changmo and the title track \\"1+1=0\\" featuring singer Dean. The fact that there are only five songs in the mini-album further supports the hypothesis that it is not a standard-length album. As previously mentioned, a standard-length album usually comprises 10 to 14 songs. Based on these points, we can conclude that the hypothesis stating Walkin' is not a standard-length album is true. The paragraph clearly presents Walkin' as a mini-album with a smaller tracklist than one would expect from a full-length album."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

See options at the end She bought a bike instead of a car because she is living on a budget and the Select from: [+] bike is more expensive. [+] car is more expensive.","completion":"She bought a bike instead of a car because she is living on a budget and the car is more expensive. Opting for a bike over a car can be advantageous in several ways, particularly if one is looking to save money and maintain a tight budget. Firstly, the initial purchasing cost of a bike is significantly lower than that of a car. Cars can range from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the make, model, and additional features. Bikes, on the other hand, can be obtained for as little as a couple of hundred dollars, depending on the brand and style. This essential difference in upfront expenditures allows individuals living on a budget to afford the mode of transportation they require without having to heavily invest in something like a car. In addition to the lower purchasing price, bikes have lower costs in terms of maintenance, fuel, and insurance. Bikes need little care and no fuel to run, as they are human-powered. Regular maintenance consists primarily of simple tasks such as inflating tires, oiling chains, and tightening bolts, which are both inexpensive and accessible. Cars, on the other hand, require regular servicing, including oil changes, brake pad replacements, tire rotations, and various other necessary procedures that can add up over time. Moreover, cars need fuel to function, which is a continuous expense that fluctuates with market prices. Additionally, car insurance rates can be costly and depend on various factors such as age, driving history, and the type of car an individual owns. Another advantage of choosing a bike over a car when living on a budget relates to health benefits. Riding a bike regularly contributes to improved cardiovascular health, increased stamina, and enhanced muscle strength. This is particularly beneficial for those attempting to maintain a healthy lifestyle without incurring high gym membership costs. Instead of paying for gym memberships or exercise classes, individuals can engage in a physical activity that doubles as their means of transportation. Furthermore, using a bike reduces one's environmental impact compared to driving a car. Bikes produce zero emissions, whereas cars release greenhouse gases that contribute to air pollution and climate change. By choosing a bike, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint and support sustainability efforts. This not only benefits the environment but also helps individuals feel that they are contributing positively to the planet. In conclusion, she bought a bike instead of a car because she is living on a budget, and the car is more expensive. This choice has many advantages: lower initial costs, reduced maintenance and fuel expenses, fitness and health benefits, and a smaller impact on the environment. Riding a bike can be an excellent alternative for individuals who wish to save money, prioritize their health, and be more eco-conscious in their day-to-day lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Mattie Moss Clark. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. After a four-year gap between releases, the sisters continued as a foursome, signing with Rejoice Records, a division of Word. This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated Heart & Soul (1986) featuring the mainstream single \\"Time Out\\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \\"Jesus Is A Love Song\\", \\"Balm in Gilead\\", and \\"Pray for the USA\\", which has been re-recorded several times. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \\"Smile, God Loves You\\", \\"Time Out\\", \\"I Am Blessed\\", and the funky \\"He'll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\\" In 1988, The Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album Conqueror. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. Conqueror quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \\"The Darkest Hour Is Just Before The Day\\" and the original studio version of \\"Jesus Forevermore\\". In 1989, The Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, Bringing it Back Home, recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from The Clark Sisters on Word Records' Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon Rance Allen and backing choir vocals from The Michigan State Choir directed by Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. In 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, Miracle, was the first album The Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of Twinkie Clark. Produced by BeBe Winans & Michael J. Powell, this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \\"Expect A Miracle\\" (now titled \\"Miracle\\") and a remake of the classic \\"Jesus Is The Best Thing\\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \\"Work To Do\\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications. did sthey have other successes?","completion":"Yes, The Clark Sisters had many successes.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone. Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table increased, sixteenth century or twentieth century? A:","completion":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table increase, due to the significant changes in land use during that time. In the sixteenth century, Michigan was covered in forests, with plant species like elm and oak being plentiful. However, by the twentieth century, vast areas of vegetation, particularly in the state's northeast region, were cleared, and wooded areas were replaced by farmlands. The introduction of agriculture, specifically farm lands, brought about the need for heavy irrigation to sustain crop growth. This irrigation played a crucial role in increasing the water table and mobilizing salts in the area. As a result, groundwater salinization became a prominent issue, affecting the buffering properties of the ecosystems. Vegetation clearance further exacerbated this problem by allowing the salinized water to come into contact with water habitats and vegetation, causing stress to species not adapted to high salinity levels. Irrigation and vegetation clearance in the twentieth century led to a variety of negative consequences for the environment, including reduced photosynthesis and water uptake in plants due to high salinity levels. Furthermore, forests in areas with high salinity and shallow groundwater depths experienced a decline, making them more susceptible to droughts. In summary, it was during the twentieth century when the water table in northeast Michigan increased, mainly due to vegetation clearance and the introduction of farmlands that required extensive irrigation for crop growth.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Add punctuation: Before you can open a CNDF file youll need to figure out what kind of file the CNDF file extension refers to","completion":"Before you can open a CNDF file, you'll need to figure out what kind of file the CNDF file extension refers to. First and foremost, it is important to understand that a file extension is a short sequence of characters that follows the name of a file, typically indicated by a period and a series of letters or numbers. This extension is used to identify the file format, which in turn determines how software programs on your computer will interact with the file. In the case of a CNDF file extension, this particular sequence of characters is not widely recognized or associated with a specific file format. There are a few possible reasons for this: 1. It could be a custom or proprietary file format associated with a specific software or company. Some applications, especially those developed for internal use within a company, create their own file formats that are tailored for their purposes. If this is the case, you would need to find out which application created the CNDF file and how the file can be opened or converted. 2. The CNDF file extension could represent an uncommon or outdated file format. Over time, various file formats fall out of use as newer, more efficient formats emerge. In these instances, specialized software may be required to access the file, or it may be necessary to convert the file into a more modern format. 3. The CNDF extension might simply be a typo or a mistake. It is not uncommon for file extensions to be accidentally altered or mistyped, which could lead to difficulties when attempting to open the file. If you suspect this may be the case, try to determine the correct file extension based on the content or purpose of the file and then rename it accordingly. In order to identify the nature of a CNDF file, consider the following steps: 1. Examine the file's properties: Right-click on the file, select \\"Properties,\\" and look for any information that could provide clues about the source or purpose of the file. 2. Use a file identification tool: Several online tools are available that can help you identify unknown file formats based on their content. Upload the CNDF file to the tool, and it may provide you with a more accurate file format or suggestions for software that can open the file. 3. Contact the source of the file: If you received the CNDF file from a colleague or downloaded it from a specific website, reach out to the person or organization that provided the file. They may be able to give you more information about the file format and how it can be opened or converted. 4. Search online for the CNDF extension: Conduct an online search for \\"CNDF file extension\\" or any variations, paying attention to forums and discussion boards where others may have encountered similar issues. By sharing their experiences and solutions, you may find valuable insights on how to handle the CNDF file correctly. Remember that attempting to open a file with an unknown extension could potentially expose your computer to security risks. Always exercise caution and ensure you are using trusted software to access unfamiliar file formats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: what kind of fish are in patagonia lake?","completion":"Patagonia Lake is a beautiful, 265-acre reservoir located within Patagonia Lake State Park in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. This lake is surrounded by lush vegetation and stunning landscapes, offering a home to a variety of fish species. Anglers and fishing enthusiasts from around the world visit this gem for the abundant fishing opportunities available. There are several kinds of fish that inhabit Patagonia Lake, providing a diverse array of fishing experiences from shore and boat fishing to fly fishing. Here is a detailed list of the fish species found in Patagonia Lake: 1. Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides): Also known as black bass, this sought-after game fish species is popular among anglers due to its aggressive fighting style and their willingness to strike a variety of lures and baits. Largemouth bass can grow quite large, with trophy-sized specimens weighing over 10 pounds. 2. Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu): Similar to its larger cousin, smallmouth bass are also a popular sportfish in Patagonia Lake. Though smaller in size compared to largemouth bass, they are known for their fighting ability and acrobatic jumps when hooked. Smallmouth bass prefer rocky habitats and often feed on crayfish and smaller fish. 3. Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus): These whiskered fish are popular among anglers for their taste and the challenge they provide when caught. Channel catfish in Patagonia Lake can grow to impressive sizes and are known to strike various baits, including cut bait, prepared baits, chicken liver, and live bait such as worms and shad. 4. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus): Bluegill are a popular panfish species that are relatively easy to catch and great fun for kids and beginner anglers. They will bite on a variety of baits, such as worms, crickets, and small jigs. Bluegills in Patagonia Lake can often be found in schools around brushy areas, submerged structures, and weed beds. 5. Redear Sunfish (Lepomis microlophus): Also known as shellcrackers, redear sunfish are similar in appearance to bluegill but are differentiated by the red or orange coloration on their “ear” flaps. They are known for their fondness of snails and can be caught using small baits, including live worms and insects. 6. Black Crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus): Black crappie is a popular panfish that can provide exciting action for anglers using light tackle. These fish can be found around submerged structures and vegetation, where they feed on smaller fish and aquatic insects. They can be caught using small jigs, minnows, and various artificial lures. 7. Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): Patagonia Lake is stocked with rainbow trout during the cooler months, which provides an excellent opportunity for anglers to target these beautiful fish. Trout can be caught using a variety of techniques, including fly fishing, spinning, and bait fishing. Popular baits and lures include PowerBait, worms, salmon eggs, and small spinners or spoons. 8. Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum): This filter-feeding species is not typically targeted by anglers but serves as an important forage fish for predator species in the lake, such as bass and catfish. While this list covers the most common species found in Patagonia Lake, occasional sightings of other species may occur. Due to its diverse underwater habitats and ecosystems, Patagonia Lake offers anglers the chance to target various fish species and enjoy the beauty of nature in this scenic locale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michelena initially served as a member of the Supreme Executive Power, an interim governing body, from April 1, 1823, to October 10, 1824. This body was created following the fall of Mexico's first emperor, Agustín de Iturbide, who had declared himself Emperor Agustín I. Michelena and his colleagues, including Guadalupe Victoria, Vicente Guerrero, Pedro Celestino Negrete, Miguel Domínguez, and Nicolás Bravo, were responsible for overseeing the transition from a constitutional monarchy to the Federal Republic. Michelena's predecessor in office was Agustín I, who ruled as a constitutional monarch. Following the fall of the monarchy, the Federal Republic was established, with Guadalupe Victoria as its first president and Michelena's successor. During this period, José Mariano Michelena worked alongside his fellow leaders to help shape the new government and navigate the challenges that arose during this time of political instability. Towards the end of his life, Michelena returned to Morelia, Michoacán, where he eventually died on May 10, 1852.

Archaeologists believe that the group of round houses found in Dumfries and Galloway date back to the fifth century BC. It proves that people lived in Wigtownshire long before Ninian set up a church at Whithorn in 397AD. Local volunteers have joined experts in a three-week long excavation of the site at Black Loch of Myrton. Julia Muir-Watt, of the Whithorn Trust, said the discovery of the round houses has had a significant impact on the accepted history of the region. She said: \\"We are looking at a complete re-writing really of the early history of Whithorn and indeed southern Scotland. \\"We think there is a very different history to the way Christianity came to southern Scotland. \\"We originally thought that Ninian came to an empty area where he founded a church and now we think there was a strong native community, potentially a high status secular site where Christianity came because people converted. \\"And so we're very interested in finding out about the peoples who lived here long before the Christian period.\\" The site under excavation was originally thought to be the site of a lone crannog, an ancient loch dwelling. During a dig in 2013 however, the archaeologists said they made a \\"spectacular\\" find. They claimed to have discovered the best-preserved loch village known in Scotland, comparable with sites in Glastonbury and Meare in Somerset. The current excavation is the third at the site since 2010. It is being led by Graeme Cavers, of AOC Archeology. He said: \\"It's very rare for us to find something like this which is effectively just a roundhouse built on to the bog itself without any foundations at all. \\"It looks like there has been seven or eight of these buildings, and very possibly more. \\"The traces we can see on the surface are really just mounds but we take it that these are signs of other buildings on the settlement.\\" He added: \\"This is very early Iron Age so we are dealing with quite settled farming communities so these people would have been farming these fields around them, they would have had herds of livestock which they would have been managing as well. \\"[They were] settled, quite sophisticated communities with the landscape very much in hand agriculturally.\\" One of the volunteers taking part in the excavation was John Picken, a former curator of Stranraer museum. He said: \\"What I am digging is compressed leaf litter. What they must have done is put down these layers of reeds and leaf and over the centuries it's got compressed to make this wonderful hard surface. \\"Digging it, we just peel it off and beneath it the original woodwork just appears. It looks almost like it's been laid yesterday.\\" During the current project, the team has excavated about a quarter of one round house. With evidence of several more, there is the potential for much more work for archaeologists. Ann Crone, of AOC Archaeology said: \\"There is a lot more here to explore and the preservation is so good that any investment in further excavation is going to yield fantastic results but at the moment I don't know how long it will go on for.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"This article reports on an archaeological dig in Black Loch of Myrton, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Roundhouses dating back to the fifth century BC were discovered, challenging previous historical beliefs that the region was empty until Ninian, a Christian figure, established a church there in 397 AD. The unearthed ancient loch village is reportedly one of the best preserved in Scotland and it is prompting a significant reassessment of the early history of southern Scotland. The excavation is the third at the site since 2010, led by Graeme Cavers of AOC Archaeology, in collaboration with local volunteers.

The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive. Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers. Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help. After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera (Karra Elejalde), to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with tabloid journalist Quiroga (Tristan Ulloa), a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic.

The phrase \\"world between the living and the dead\\" of the original is changed to \\"void between...\\". There is also a new line at the end: \\"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!\\"[1] The opening credits feature the image of \\"an immobile young woman clad in gold\\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).[1] Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff.[1] The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \\"Princess of the Night\\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.[1] As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery.[1] The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the...

Eddie A:","completion":"Title: One Last Bet Step 1: Establish a preliminary setting for the movie The setting of the movie will be modern day, in a bustling and economically prosperous city, known for its glamorous casinos and criminal underground. Step 2: Introduce the protagonist, Eddie, and provide a backstory Eddie is an ex-gambler with an incredible attention to detail and a deep understanding of the criminal world. He has had a troubled past with gambling addiction and lost everything in a final poker game against a cunning mob boss. He has since turned his life around and now works as an undercover police officer determined to expose and dismantle the city's corrupt gambling establishments. Step 3: Establish the antagonist The antagonist, Victor, is the powerful and ruthless mob boss, who currently controls the city's casinos and is engaged in illegal activities, ranging from rigging games to money laundering and human trafficking. He is always one step ahead of the authorities and strives to maintain an untouchable persona. Step 4: Present a challenge or opportunity for the protagonist Eddie is offered the opportunity to infiltrate Victor's organization and gather evidence to take him down. His unique skill set and gambling background makes him the perfect candidate to navigate the dangerous world he once left behind. Step 5: Create tension through Eddie's internal struggle Throughout the movie, Eddie faces internal conflicts of loyalty and temptations - his history with gambling addiction lurks in the shadows as he revisits his old stomping grounds, but he desperately wants to make a difference and take down Victor, the man who was the catalyst for his downward spiral. Step 6: Develop the undercover arc, acquiring evidence, and forming a connection to another character As Eddie gets deeper into Victor's operation, he befriends a kind-hearted casino worker, Sarah, who is also secretly trying to expose the illegal activities. Together, they gather information and evidence, growing closer both professionally and personally. Step 7: Setback and complications Eddie's cover is almost blown when Victor suspects there's a mole within the organization. Eddie must throw off suspicion by demonstrating his loyalty and participating in an armed robbery. Meanwhile, Sarah is discovered to have leaked information to the police, placing her life in danger. Step 8: Climactic confrontation Eddie's final gambit is to face Victor in a high-stakes poker game, where he uses his sharp mind and abilities to outsmart him, securing the decisive evidence needed to take down the entire organization. In a tense showdown, Eddie exposes Victor's illegal activities and corruption, leading to his arrest. Step 9: Resolution Eddie has successfully dismantled the criminal empire, avenging his past and providing a safer future for the city. He leaves the dark world of gambling behind, now having found purpose and a brighter life with Sarah. The movie concludes with Eddie and Sarah beginning a new life together and dedicating their time to helping those affected by gambling addiction and crime, ensuring that others do not fall into the same traps that they once faced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dust with ground cardamom..","completion":"Between the two available choices, I would choose: [B]. Make Classic Hot Cocoa, but sweeten the whipped cream with brown sugar. Dust with ground cardamom. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Make Classic Hot Cocoa - The base of both options is the classic hot cocoa recipe. It is a widely known and well-established method of making hot cocoa. 2. Sweeten the whipped cream with brown sugar - Both options involve sweetening the whipped cream. Brown sugar adds a deeper, richer flavor to the whipped cream which complements the hot cocoa well. 3. Dust with ground cardamom - Both options include adding ground cardamom, which is a spice that provides a warm and aromatic flavor to the hot cocoa. Comparing the two choices: [A] suggests sweetening the whipped cream using grated carrots and brown sugar. While this method may be an innovative approach and provide a unique flavor, it is not conventional in making hot cocoa. Additionally, carrots, being a vegetable, may not meld well with the hot cocoa's overall flavor profile. [B] is more consistent with traditional hot cocoa preparation. The use of brown sugar to sweeten the whipped cream aligns better with naive physics reasoning and ensures a more familiar and enjoyable outcome.

There are already signs of a slim down, but so far it’s been a nip and tuck here and there. On Monday, the company said it is selling its ad placement business to AOL AOL , offloading 1,200 positions in that process. And, it is transferring part of Bing’s mapping business (and another 100 positions) to Uber. But smart money is that Microsoft MSFT will be chopping more jobs, mostly from the mobile phone ranks. The phone business was folded into a new Windows and Devices unit under Terry Myerson in a reorg two weeks ago, with former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop exiting at that time. Recall too how, at this time last year, unconfirmed reports of impending layoffs surfaced. The following week, CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo about the company’s strategic direction with mention of unnamed-but-fundamental-cultural changes needed to achieve it. The next week: boom! A plan to cut 18,000 people in the course of the year. That was the largest downsizing in the company’s history but was not a total surprise given that Microsoft picked up 25,000 employees in its 7 billion acquisition of Nokia’s struggling phone business. So will history repeat itself? In an internal memo that leaked last week, Nadella talked about tough choices to come, so folks are on edge in Redmond. The most recent headcount on Microsoft’s web site from June 2014 lists 128,000 employees; others estimate that current employee count is at about 118,000, which does not represent a net loss of 18,000 jobs. That’s probably because, much to Wall Street’s chagrin, Microsoft kept hiring in strategic areas, while culling people from less, um strategic areas. Microsoft had no comment for this story.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Over the last 70 years, researchers have been studying happy and unhappy people and finally found out ten factors that make a difference. Our feelings of well-being at any moment are determined to a certain degree by genes. However, of all the factors, wealth and age are the top two. Money can buy a degree of happiness. But once you can afford to feed, clothe and house yourself , each extra dollar makes less and less difference. Researchers find that, on average, wealthier people are happier. But the link between money and happiness is complex. In the past half-century, average income has sharply increased in developed countries, yet happiness levels have remained almost the same. Once your basic needs are met, money only seems to increase happiness if you have more than your friends, neighbors and colleagues. \\"Dollars buy status, and status makes people feel better,\\" conclude some experts, which helps explain why people who can seek status in other ways---scientists or actors, for example--may happily accept relatively poorly-paid jobs. In a research, Professor Alex Michalos found that the people whose desires--not just for money, but for friends, family, job, health--rose furthest beyond what they already had, tended to be less happy than those who felt a smaller gap. Indeed, the size of the gap predicted happiness about five times better than income alone. \\"The gap measures just blow away the only measures of income.\\" Says Michalos. Another factor that has to do with happiness is age. Old age may not be so bad. \\"Given all the problems of aging, how could the elderly be more satisfied?\\" asks Professor Laura Carstensen. In one survey, Carstensen interviewed 184 people between the ages of 18 and 94, and asked them to fill out an emotions questionnaire. She found that old people reported positive emotions just as often as young people, but negative emotions much less often. Why are old people happier? Some scientists suggest older people may expect life to be harder and learn to live with it, or they're more... Question: According to the passage, the feeling of happiness _ .

Knowledge of Sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient India, and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of Vyākaraṇins such as Pāṇini and Patanjali, who exhorted proper Sanskrit at all times, especially during ritual. Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits, which were Middle Indo-Aryan languages. However, linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility. Of what was Sanskrit once thought to be a divider?","completion":"Sanskrit, in its early conception, was thought to be a divider of social class and educational attainment in ancient India. This distinction was based on the idea that it was not simply a specific language separate from other languages, but rather a refined and perfected manner of speaking. As a result, knowledge of Sanskrit became a marker for individuals belonging to the higher castes, who had access to advanced education and were engaged in intellectual and religious activities. The precise and sophisticated nature of Sanskrit was maintained through the works of eminent grammarians such as Pāṇini and Patanjali, who established rules for language usage, ensuring the preservation of its elevated status. These Vyākaraṇins emphasized the importance of using proper Sanskrit, particularly during rituals, to preserve its sanctity and convey the intended meanings accurately. In contrast to Sanskrit, there were the vernacular Prakrits - Middle Indo-Aryan languages spoken by the wider population. Prakrits were regional languages that gradually evolved and diversified over time, reflecting the linguistic tendencies of different areas and communities across the Indian subcontinent. While Sanskrit was considered the language of the elite and well-educated upper castes, Prakrits were accessible to people from various social strata and served as a means of daily communication. The gradual linguistic changes taking place over centuries led to a loss of mutual intelligibility between Sanskrit and the Prakrits, further establishing the division of the two. This barrier accentuated Sanskrit's role as a language that represented intellectual pursuits, religious expression, classical literature, and cultural heritage. Consequently, it became an even more distinct symbol of social and educational divisions in ancient India, separating the learned elite from the general population engaging in the Prakrits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"The destruction of the Ottoman Egyptian fleet was a result of a battle at Navarino, which took place during the Greek War of Independence. This conflict occurred after three Great Powers – Russia, the United Kingdom, and France – decided to intervene in the ongoing conflict between the Greeks and the Ottoman Empire. These nations each sent a navy to Greece to support the Greek cause. Upon receiving news that a combined Ottoman-Egyptian fleet was planning to attack the Greek island of Hydra, the allied forces – consisting of Russian, British, and French navies – took action and intercepted the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet at Navarino. What followed was a week-long standoff between the two forces, culminating in a fierce battle that ultimately led to the complete destruction of the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet. In the aftermath of this decisive battle, a French expeditionary force was sent to oversee the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese region of Greece. Meanwhile, Greek forces continued to gain ground, capturing parts of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation and diplomacy, coupled with the significant military achievements of the Greek resistance, the nascent Greek state was finally recognized under the London Protocol in 1830. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"Who destroyed the Ottoman Egyptian fleet?\\" is the combined navies of Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, who worked together to intercept and decisively defeat the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino. This important victory was a pivotal event in the Greek War of Independence, eventually leading to the recognition of the Greek state in 1830."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and","completion":"To evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review sentence, which is \\"immensely ambitious, different than anything that's been done before and,\\" we need to understand the context and meaning behind the words used and derive the overall feeling or attitude conveyed by the reviewer. Breaking down the sentence, we have three key phrases: 1. \\"immensely ambitious\\": This phrase indicates that the reviewer thinks the movie has a significant and determined effort to achieve something great. \\"Immensely\\" implies a high degree of ambition, and so this part of the sentence has a positive sentiment. 2. \\"different than anything\\": This phrase suggests that the movie is unique and distinct from other films in its genre or style. Generally, referring to a movie as \\"different\\" can reflect either a positive or negative sentiment based on the context. However, in this instance, the rest of the sentence helps support the positive sentiment. 3. \\"that's been done before\\": This phrase ultimately confirms the uniqueness of the movie mentioned in the previous segment. It implies that the movie stands out from its predecessors and offers a fresh take on its subject matter or style. Considering these phrases together, the overall sentiment of the movie review sentence is positive. The reviewer seems to appreciate the ambitious nature and uniqueness of the film, which distinguishes it from other movies. The sentiment suggests the reviewer may have enjoyed the movie or thinks it has merits worth praising. However, it is important to note that the sentence is incomplete, so forming a comprehensive conclusion depends on the context provided by the rest of the review.

Al Gore Meets With Donald And Ivanka Trump In Search For 'Common Ground' Enlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Hagen/Getty Images Kevin Hagen/Getty Images In what may be the most unlikely meeting of the presidential transition process so far, former vice president, former Democratic presidential nominee, former senator and Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore met with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday. Gore has spent decades warning about the dire consequences of unchecked, man-made climate change, while Trump has regularly called climate change \\"a hoax\\" during the campaign. Initially, the session was not even expected to include the president-elect. According to the transition spokesman, it was scheduled as a sit-down between Gore and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who is a member of the official transition team. Ivanka Trump, 35, is also an executive with the Trump Organization, and Trump has described her as one of his most trusted advisers. There was no preview of the agenda for the former vice president and the president-elect's daughter. Politico reported last week that Ivanka, who is expected to play some of the social roles typically occupied by the first lady, is interested in making climate change one of her signature issues. Since the election, she has met with actor and climate change activist Leonardo DiCaprio to discuss the issue, when he, according to the New York Times, gave her a copy of his documentary film on the topic. A full 90 minutes after Gore entered Trump Tower, the golden elevator doors in Trump Tower's lobby opened and Gore emerged, according to pool reports. In a very brief statement to reporters staking out the lobby, Gore revealed that he spent most of his time upstairs meeting with Trump himself. \\"I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground,\\" said Gore. \\"I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that.\\" It's not clear exactly how Ivanka Trump's views on climate change differ from her father's and what influence she might have on him. He has proposed walking away from the 2015 Paris Agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. As a candidate, Trump championed the American coal industry, saying that environmental regulations had harmed the industry and cost the jobs of miners. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Former Vice President Al Gore met with President-elect Donald Trump for what he described as “an extremely interesting conversation” at Trump Tower on Monday. Gore, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton, declined to say what exactly he and Trump spoke about during the meeting. But he said he met with both the president-elect and Ivanka Trump, who reportedly wants to make climate change one of her signature issues. \\"I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground... I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that,\\" Gore told reporters after the meeting. Later Monday, Gore spoke to MNSBC's Chris Hayes and reiterated that he felt good about the meeting, adding \\"we're in this wait and see period, but I was happy to have the opportunity and to have the exchange of views.\\" Although he was reluctant to go into detail about his conversation with the President-elect, Gore also praised Ivanka Trump's commitment to the issue, saying her passion was \\"certainly evident\\" during the brief conversation they had before his meeting with Trump. Ultimately, Gore said he believes the momentum and international support built up around climate change will continue no matter the policies of the next administration. \\"I think the momentum is unstoppable now, we're winning this — we're going to win it — but there is a serious question as to how fast we will win and that's crucial,\\" he said. Since leaving public life following his unsuccessful 2000 presidential run, Gore has become one of the best known crusaders in the fight against human-caused climate change. He hit the campaign trail for Clinton in the final months of the presidential contest, calling her both the best candidate to combat global warming and reminding supporters “every single vote counts.” Clinton, like Gore in 2000, won the popular vote but lost the electoral college. Before running for office, Trump called climate change a hoax “created by and for the Chinese.” However, Trump said he has an “open mind” on the issue in an interview with the New York Times last month. ||||| Jill Stein, the Green Party's 2016 presidential nominee, challenged climate change activist Al Gore Al GoreMcCain: Dems killed Lieberman’s FBI shot Five things to know about Joe Lieberman Lieberman is front-runner for FBI director: report MORE to step up his efforts.

Article: Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century, 10 to 18 million sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas. Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies: The traders shipped more female slaves than males, as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards. The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama campaign aides huddle with Bill Clinton Many observers see ex-president Bill Clinton's new book, Back to Work, as something of a blueprint for President Obama's re-election bid. Turns out that the Obama campaign sought Clinton's advice directly. The National Memo reports that top Obama adviser David Axelrod and other campaign aides met Clinton at the former president's foundation office in New York City on Nov. 9. \\"While Axelrod arrived with no particular 'ask' beyond Clinton's advice, the meeting ended with the Obama group telling the former president something he may already have surmised: They want him actively involved in the re-election campaign and expect to engage him regularly in the months ahead,\\" reported The National Memo. President Obama's top political operatives -- including campaign chief adviser David Axelrod -- traveled from Chicago and Washington to the headquarters of the William Jefferson Clinton foundation in Harlem last Wednesday afternoon for a meeting with the former president and two of his top aides. The topic? How to re-elect the current president -- including some very specific advice from Clinton, according to sources present. The Nov. 9 meeting, which went on for more than two hours, also included Clinton counselor Douglas Band and Justin Cooper, a senior adviser whose multiple responsibilities have included work on the former president's memoir and last two books. Their guests were former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina, who is serving as Obama's 2012 campaign manager; Patrick Gaspard, executive director of the Democratic National Committee who until recently oversaw political affairs in the White House; and Obama's lead pollster Joel Benenson, who played the same role in the 2008 campaign. \\"We were the ones who reached out for the conversation,\\" said one of the participants from the Obama campaign, who confirmed the details. \\"We did so to lay out the landscape for the [former] president as we see it, but our particular interest was to receive his insights, and we were fortunate enough to benefit from them.\\" The same source said that they hope and expect to engage regularly with Clinton. As the meeting began, the Obama aides laid out their sense of the political landscape, their polling data on attitudes among voters in the Democratic base and independents who might be truly undecided, the shaping of their message and their campaign's organizational structure across the country. They also frankly discussed findings from voter focus groups that the campaign has conducted in recent months. Much of the presentation dealt with battleground states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and Arizona ... Having absorbed all this information, Clinton peppered the Obama operatives with dozens of probing questions and specific suggestions, not only concerning their strategy and message but how to handle the leading Republican candidates, too. Economic conditions and how to address them dominated the discussion. What most interested the Obama team were Clinton's insights on heartland voting blocs that remain in the political middle: not the Republican-leaning independents who always end up voting for the GOP nominee, but the truly uncommitted who largely ended up supporting Obama in 2008.","completion":"Top Obama adviser David Axelrod and other campaign aides met with former president Bill Clinton at his foundation office in New York City on November 9.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Once the water has filled the bottle, turn off the faucet and screw the lid back on. Let's explore the reasoning behind this choice in comparison to option (b): 1. Unscrewing the lid: In both options (a) and (b), the action of unscrewing the lid is necessary because you need an open bottle to allow water to flow inside. This action prepares the bottle for effective, unobstructed water flow. 2. Placing the bottle under the faucet: In both options (a) and (b), placing the bottle under the faucet is a prerequisite to channeling the water into the bottle. By positioning the bottle under the faucet, you create the right conditions for the water to flow into the bottle upon turning on the faucet. 3.

In option (a), you are instructed to turn on the water after placing the bottle under the faucet, which is the logical and necessary step to fill the bottle. The water, under high pressure, will flow from the faucet and into the bottle. Conversely, option (b) instructs you to turn off the water, which would not fill the bottle as no water would flow from the faucet. 4. Once the water has filled the bottle: In option (a), this part of the instruction is feasible because you've allowed the water to flow into the bottle. Contrarily, this cannot be achieved in option (b) since you have turned off the water, preventing water flow and filling the bottle. 5. Turning off the faucet: In option (a), this is sensible because it is crucial to stop the water flow after the bottle has been filled. However, in option (b), the water is already turned off and no filling has occurred in the process; hence, this instruction is redundant and counterproductive. 6. Screw the lid back on: In both options (a) and (b), screwing the lid back on is the final step. It is, however, only practical in option (a) once the bottle has been filled as desired. In option (b), the bottle would still be empty because no proper water-filling procedure has been followed, making this step inconsequential. Considering the logical progression of the actions detailed in option (a) compared to option (b), it is clear that option (a) offers a more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition. Now, I have a new situation: Barb and Ann were friends.

Read the premise: Derry plugged herself into the mesh of circuitry taking up most of her living room, and spent a long moment doing what I can only describe as writhe. 2. Identify the key points: Derry is connected to a mesh of circuitry, and she is writhing. 3. Determine the meaning of the hypothesis: Derry was being zapped. Here, \\"zapped\\" likely means that Derry was experiencing an electric shock or a similar sensation leading her to writhing. 4. Analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis: The fact that Derry is plugged into the mesh of circuitry suggests that she may be experiencing an electric shock or current. Her writhing is another clue to support that theory. However, the premise does not explicitly state that Derry was being zapped, making it difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is true with absolute certainty.

The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Question: What may hurt astronauts fingernails while working in space?

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year.

This alliance was strengthened in October by Charles IV of Lorraine. Imperial and Dutch troops conquered the town of Naarden from the French on 13 September. The Spanish, who had yet to formally enter the war, declared war on the French on 16 October. At about the same time Frederick William re-entered the war against France.

An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] After reading the above, is \\"Because the gravity is stronger\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Why does an astronaut weigh less on the moon than on earth\\"?","completion":"To calculate the weight in newtons of a mass of 50 kg on Earth, we follow these steps: 1. Recall the formula for calculating weight: Weight = Mass × Gravitational force 2. The gravitational force on Earth is approximately 9.8 N/kg (Newtons per kilogram). 3. Plug in the values into the formula: Weight = 50 kg × 9.8 N/kg Weight = 490 N So, the weight of a 50 kg mass on Earth is 490 newtons. Now, let's evaluate whether \\"Because the gravity is stronger\\" is a correct answer to the question \\"Why does an astronaut weigh less on the moon than on earth?\\" The text explains that astronauts weigh less on the moon than on Earth due to the difference in gravity. The moon has a weaker gravitational force compared to Earth, which causes objects (including astronauts) to weigh less on the moon. So the correct answer to the question should be \\"Because the gravity on the moon is weaker,\\" not \\"Because the gravity is stronger.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you want a know-it-all to listen to you, you must appeal to their sense of self-importance. Since they are not naturally good listeners, you will have to create some problem that you want their advice on. This gets their attention since you appealed to the value of their opinion. Ask something like, “I have a problem waking up in the morning, what do you think is the best way to get started in the morning?” Prepare verified facts when entering into a conversation with a know-it-all will limit their negative impact and opportunities to interject. If you are giving a presentation, hand out an agenda ahead of the meeting with a time limit for each phase of the talk. Add statistics and cited facts that are indisputable. Preparation is always the key. The more prepared you are to defend your perspective the better off you will be in dealing with a know-it-all. If you prefer to be a little more direct you can preempt statements with truisms that give little room for a know-it-all to get involved in the conversation. Since truisms are obviously true, know-it-alls can only offer moderate, less overbearing responses. Before making a statement, say “If we are open to all possibilities, then we could look at it this way.” These types of truisms throw off know-it-alls because it is directed towards them making them have to rethink what they were going to say. Or, after a know-it-all provides their response, say, “I am shocked to hear this because I thought your perspective would be different.” This surprises them because you are questioning their response without being too confrontational. A know-it-all is often a contrarian – you say “day,” they say “night.” They just cannot help themselves. Being a contrarian compels them to say the opposite even if the truth is overlooked just to hear their own voice. Coerce the know-it-all to have to agree with your position by presenting the opposite perspective before making your statement: “I know you will disagree with this; indeed, you will certainly think this to be ridiculous, but…” Now the contrarian has no choice but to agree with you. Sometimes the only way you can get a know-it-all to accept your position is to repeat it over and over. You must be resilient and avoid getting caught up in their perspective. The strategy is to make them figure it out on their own through dogged repetition and to exhaust them to the point of surrender. For example: “I understand how important it is to you, but I don’t want to do it…seriously, I don’t want to do it…Yes, of course I am very clear how important it is, but I don’t want to do it.” Or, “I think it is too expensive…Sure, it’s a good deal, but it’s too expensive…I understand there is financing available, but it’s too expensive.” Know-it-alls enjoy being contrarians and voicing their perspectives. If this becomes too annoying challenge their responses by asking detailed questions to break down their position. This forces the know-it-all to be better prepared before blurting out answers they cannot support with evidence. Be respectful, but ask specific questions about their sources, facts, or experiences. Do not be afraid to confront a know-it-all about their expertise or authority. Summary:","completion":"The article suggests various strategies to effectively communicate with a know-it-all, including appealing to their self-importance, using verified facts, employing truisms, presenting opposite perspectives, repeating statements, and asking detailed questions to challenge their responses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship.

John Kruger The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Erased Identities Genre: Action, Thriller, Mystery Plot Summary: U.S. Marshal John Kruger, a seasoned and highly skilled officer, is assigned to protect a high-profile witness set to testify against a notorious crime lord, Alexander Valkov. Unknown to Kruger, he's about to be dragged into a complex conspiracy that will force him to question the true nature of his own existence. Act 1: A New Assignment - Introduce John Kruger, a top U.S. Marshal with a reputation for successfully protecting witnesses in high-stakes cases. - Kruger is assigned to protect a high-profile witness, Dr. Emily Warren, an esteemed scientist who's set to testify against the dangerous crime lord, Alexander Valkov. - Kruger and his team start working closely with Emily to secure her safety as they prepare for the upcoming trial. - Emily reveals that her research is centered around the cutting-edge technology of memory alteration and artificial intelligence. Act 2: Dark Secrets Unveiled - As the trial date approaches, Emily receives threatening messages and several attempts on her life. Kruger and his team manage to successfully protect her. - Suspicious about the highly targeted attacks, Kruger starts to dig deeper into Emily's research and her connection to Valkov. - Kruger discovers that Emily's work in memory alteration was being funded by Valkov, who planned to use it for sinister purposes - erasing and manipulating people's identities to create his own army of perfect criminals. - Meanwhile, Emily shares that she had found a top-secret file in her research facility with Kruger's name on it, making him a potential target too. Act 3: The Truth Unraveled - Kruger desperately searches for answers, suspecting that Alexander Valkov may have tampered with his own identity. He enlists the help of fellow Marshal, Sarah Thompson, to dig into his own past. - As Kruger's memories start to unravel, he learns that he was once an elite soldier who was working undercover in Valkov's organization. - It is revealed that Kruger's memory had been erased after an attempt on his life left him severely injured. Unknowingly, he was also a subject in Emily's memory alteration research. - With his newfound revelation, Kruger becomes determined to put an end to Valkov's illegal operations and expose the truth. Act 4: The Battle for Justice - As the trial begins, Kruger and Sarah prepare a plan to take down Valkov, who has put countless lives in danger due to his memory manipulation experiments. - With Emily's help, they extract valuable memories erased due to Valkov's influence, finding enough evidence to get him convicted. - However, during the trial, Valkov's hitmen attack the courtroom, resulting in a high-octane chase and a fierce battle. - Kruger, Sarah, and Emily successfully defeat the attackers and reveal the damning evidence against Valkov. Act 5: Redemption and Resolution - A wounded Valkov is apprehended, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison for his crimes. - As a result, further research into memory alteration is heavily regulated and monitored by the government. - Kruger undergoes memory recovery treatment, and with the help of Emily and Sarah, he learns to accept and integrate the lost chapters of his life. - The movie closes with Kruger embracing his regained memories and a newfound sense of purpose, continuing his work as a U.S. Marshal, protecting and serving the nation. In conclusion, the movie 'Erased Identities' follows the thrilling journey of U.S. Marshal John Kruger in his efforts to uncover the truth about his own past while protecting a crucial witness. The plot combines action, mystery, and psychological intrigue as characters discover their own erased identities and those manipulated by the dangerous crime lord, Alexander Valkov."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The US president-elect was being sued by former students who paid 35,000 (Â£28,000) for real estate \\"secrets\\" from his \\"hand-picked\\" instructors. Mr Trump had repeatedly said he would not settle the class-action lawsuits. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the settlement was a \\"stunning reversal\\" by Mr Trump and a \\"major victory\\" for victims. But Mr Trump's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said his client was pleased with the outcome, saying \\"he was willing to sacrifice his personal interests, put this behind him, and move forward\\". The businessman faced three fraud lawsuits - which alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises - in California and New York. A trial in one of the cases had been due to begin in San Diego on 28 November, although Mr Trump's lawyers had attempted to delay the case. Donald Trump's ongoing lawsuits Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement: \\"Today's 25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university. \\"The victims of Trump University have waited years for today's result and I am pleased that their patience - and persistence - will be rewarded by this 25 million settlement.\\" Mr Schneiderman, who Mr Trump has attacked as a \\"lightweight\\", had sought a 40m payout from Mr Trump over the university, which closed in 2010. He called Trump University a \\"fraud from beginning to end\\" in July, adding that the organisation used \\"false promises to prey on desperate people\\". US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the two California cases, had been urging both sides to settle out of court. The settlement may be costly but it will save the President-elect from a potentially embarrassing trial. Donald Trump had vowed to keep fighting this case and his attorneys said they had no doubt he would have won in court, but they added that a resolution allows Mr Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing the nation. Settling though could backfire on Mr Trump as he is facing dozens of lawsuits. Plaintiffs may smell blood and think he is eager to settle to avoid court cases while president. In June, Mr Trump said: \\"I will win the Trump University case. I already am, as far as I'm concerned. \\"I could settle that case. I could have settled that case. I just choose not to.\\" Trump University promised students the opportunity to learn from \\"hand-picked\\" teachers, that actually were not chosen by Mr Trump himself. Mr Schneiderman alleged that the closest students ever got to the real estate mogul was having their photo taken beside a cardboard cutout of him. He also said that Mr Trump personally pocketed about 5m (Â£4m) in the \\"scheme\\". Meanwhile, Donald Trump has named more conservative hardliners for key posts, with Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions nominated as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement office.

Does \\"Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"The West, South Asia and Middle East think eating dogs is what?\\"","completion":"The statement \\"Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity.\\" does not explicitly contain the correct answer to the question \\"The West, South Asia, and Middle East think eating dogs is what?\\" However, we can infer from the given information and provide a detailed answer to the question. In Western, South Asian, and Middle Eastern cultures, eating dog meat is generally considered taboo, distasteful, and morally reprehensible. This is due to a variety of historical, cultural, and religious reasons. The West: In Western countries, the relationship between humans and dogs has been traditionally shaped by the special bond that evolved over centuries, with dogs being regarded as loyal companions, pets, and working or service animals. As a result, the consumption of dog meat is culturally regarded as inappropriate and morally wrong. It is commonly associated with strong negative emotions and sentiments of disgust. It goes against the deeply rooted notion that dogs are \\"man's best friend.\\" South Asia: In South Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, the consumption of dog meat is not widely practiced for various reasons. In India, for instance, many people follow religious and cultural practices that promote vegetarianism or limit the consumption of animal products. Moreover, Hinduism, which is the dominant religion in the region, reveres the cow and considers it sacred, but it does not promote the consumption of dog meat. Even among non-vegetarians in South Asia, the idea of eating dog meat is generally seen as repulsive and against cultural norms. The Middle East: In the Middle East, the consumption of dog meat is largely influenced by religious beliefs. Islam, the predominant religion in the region, has specific dietary laws that classify certain animals as \\"halal\\" (permissible) and others as \\"haram\\" (forbidden) for consumption. According to Islamic dietary laws, the consumption of dog meat is considered haram and, therefore, it is strictly prohibited. This prohibition is deeply rooted in religious and cultural beliefs, making the consumption of dog meat socially unacceptable and repugnant in the Middle East. In summary, while the statement regarding dog meat consumption in East Asian countries does not explicitly answer the question, we can infer that the West, South Asia, and the Middle East generally consider eating dogs as taboo, repulsive, and against their cultural or religious values."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given two lists A,B.

BACKGROUND Analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma has recently been introduced as a new method for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis, particularly for the analysis of fetal genetic traits, which are absent from the maternal genome, e.g., RHD or Y-chromosome-specific sequences. To date, the analysis of other fetal genetic traits has been more problematic because of the overwhelming presence of maternal DNA sequences in the circulation. We examined whether different biochemical properties can be discerned between fetal and maternal circulatory DNA. METHODS Plasma DNA was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fractions of fetal and maternal DNA in size-fractionated fragments were assayed by real-time PCR. The determination of paternally and maternally inherited fetal genetic traits was examined by use of highly polymorphic chromosome-21-specific microsatellite markers. RESULTS Size fractionation of circulatory DNA indicated that the major portion of cell-free fetal DNA had an approximate molecular size of <0.3 kb, whereas maternally derived sequences were, on average, considerably larger than 1 kb. Analysis of size-fractionated DNA (</=0.3 kb) from maternal plasma samples facilitated the ready detection of paternally and maternally inherited microsatellite markers. CONCLUSIONS Circulatory fetal DNA can be enriched by size selection of fragment sizes less than approximately 0.3 kb. Such selection permits easier analysis of both paternally and maternally inherited DNA polymorphisms.","completion":"Title: Enrichment of Circulatory Fetal DNA by Size Selection for Noninvasive Prenatal Diagnosis of Paternally and Maternally Inherited Polymorphisms"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","completion":"James Jackson Jr. was a professional footballer born on December 4, 1900, in Newcastle, England. Best known for his competence as a full-back, Jackson had an illustrious career that spanned almost two decades. He played for various clubs, including Motherwell, Aberdeen, and Liverpool, becoming an indispensable asset for each of these teams. Jackson's journey as a footballer took off with his first club, Motherwell, from 1919 to 1923. With his incredible skills and agility, he quickly became a key member of the team. After spending four successful years with Motherwell, Jackson moved to Aberdeen, where he continued to showcase his prowess in the full-back position. His stint with Aberdeen lasted from 1923 to 1925 before he most notably joined Liverpool in 1925. Jackson spent eight remarkable years at Liverpool, from 1925 to 1933, during which his career gained prominence on a grander scale. While his club successes were astounding, Jackson's international career was comparatively modest. He received his only national cap in 1922, representing the Scottish League XI. With an unyielding dedication to his national team, he played in that one game, which added depth to his portfolio despite not being able to score a goal. Over his extensive career, Jackson made an impressive 67 caps for Motherwell and a monumental 212 caps for Liverpool, scoring two goals for each club. His commitment to the game and ability to adapt to any situation made him a versatile and integral team member wherever he went. Apart from his on-field contributions, Jackson also managed to make an impact off the field as a leader. As a testament to his sportsmanship and camaraderie, he was highly respected by both his teammates and opponents. James Jackson Jr. was not only a skilled full-back but also a symbol of hard work, determination, and a team-first attitude. Jackson's career may have started in England, but he went on to become a cherished icon of Scottish football. His dedication and passion for the sport were evident throughout his entire journey, from Motherwell to Liverpool and the Scottish national team. Sadly, James Jackson Jr. passed away around 1976. However, his indelible impact on the game will forever be remembered as the football community continues to cherish his contributions as a player and a sportsman. Although he is no longer with us, the legacy he left behind will always serve as an inspiration to aspiring footballers looking to make their mark in the beautiful game. James Jackson Jr.'s exceptional career remains a testament to his incredible talent, humility, and unwavering commitment to his teams and the sport of football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break.

K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further.

O notices he is suffering from headaches and craves chocolate milk, which she explains are symptoms of time-fracture (aka the crime of interfering with history, which Obadiah Price was imprisoned for).

Chris Anderson won all three men's downhill races which means he has taken home 20 cheeses in 13 years. The 29-year-old's tally now equals that of record holder Stephen Gyde.

He added that he \\"looks forward\\" to coming back next year and beating Mr Gyde's record. Mr Anderson has famously said he does not like double Gloucester as it is \\"too strong\\", so this year he will be auctioning one of his cheeses off for charity, and giving the other two away to family. One family member who has a cheese of her own is Mr Anderson's niece Kacey, who won the 11-15's race for the third year in a row. She said: \\"I'm feeling very tired, but I tried my best and just thought I'm going to give it another shot and see if I can get it.\\" The women's race was won by 18-year-old Keavy Morgan, also from Brockworth, who has now had two victories after first winning in 2015.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Why does Johnson snap and kill Baxter? Because he's certain Johnson is the killer A:","completion":"Step 1: Establishing the Setting I will create a setting in which the events of the story can unfold. This will be a small, enclosed community where people know each other well. Setting: A small town named Havenwood, where the residents are close-knit, and everyone knows each other. The town has a picturesque landscape and has a low crime rate, making the events to follow even more shocking. Step 2: Introducing Main Characters I will introduce the main characters around whom the story will revolve. Characters: - Johnson, a determined and reputed detective working in Havenwood for a long time. - Baxter, a mysterious newcomer in the town who often keeps to himself. Step 3: Establishing the Conflict I will establish the central conflict of the plot, which is a series of murders happening in Havenwood, leading to suspicion and fear amongst the residents. Conflict: A series of brutal murders has taken place in Havenwood, and the community is shaken from their peaceful existence. The identity of the killer is unknown, and the detective, Johnson, is tasked with solving the case. Step 4: Building Suspicion around Baxter To build the suspense and lay groundwork for Johnson's suspicion, I will write a few scenes that make Baxter appear to be the possible murderer: - Scene 1: Baxter is seen repeatedly visiting the secluded woods late at night by a nosy neighbor. - Scene 2: Johnson discovers a hidden storage area in Baxter's house containing knives similar to the murder weapon. - Scene 3: Johnson overhears a conversation in the local bar where Baxter is talking ambiguously about \\"ending the suffering\\" in the town. Step 5: Johnson's Increasing Certainty about Baxter With Baxter being the prime suspect, Johnson's focus narrows down to gathering evidence against him. In order to portray his certainty, I will create a few more scenes that solidify his belief: - Scene 4: Johnson tails Baxter one night and discovers a secret cabin in the woods filled with newspaper clippings about the murders. - Scene 5: Johnson interrogates Baxter, and Baxter denies being the killer but gives vague and contradictory answers, making him more suspicious. Step 6: Johnson's Snap and the Killing of Baxter To justify Johnson's actions in killing Baxter, I will write a scene where Johnson mistakenly believes Baxter will commit another murder, hence he snaps and takes matter into his own hands. - Climax scene: Johnson, after gathering all the evidence, is convinced that Baxter is indeed the killer. One day, he follows Baxter into the woods again, believing he is about to commit another crime. Johnson, enraged and desperate, confronts him and ultimately kills Baxter to stop him from potentially hurting anyone else. Step 7: The Plot Twist To wrap up the story with a shocking twist, I will reveal the real killer to be someone unexpected, making Johnson realize that he had killed an innocent man. - Resolution Scene: As the police continue investigating the case after Baxter's death, they find new evidence linking one of Johnson's colleagues to the murders. Johnson comes to the horrifying realization that he killed an innocent man, and now he is determined to bring the real killer to justice. With this plot structure in place, the movie will explore themes of suspicion, guilt, and the consequences of being blinded by conviction. The story will be a thrilling ride for the audience, with a shocking twist at the end that leaves them questioning their own instincts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are even cheaper do-it-yourself braces such as \\" Hello Kitty,\\" Mickey Mouse\\" or others for a price of around 100. Braces are considered a sign of wealth in Southeast Asia. A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around 1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of 345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of 1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection from a pair of fake fashion braces. Police also linked the death of another 14-year-old girl in Chonburi to a pair of fashion braces she had brought from an illegal shop. Although the government is giving warnings about fake braces, the trend has been going strong for at least four years. What's worse, the trend for fake braces shows no sign of slowing down.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA.

Article: All students need to have good habits :When you have good study habits, you learn things quickly. You also remember them easily. Do you like to study in the living room? This is not a good place because it is usually too noisy. The telephone bell rings there; the TV is there, and sometimes it is a good place for your pet dog or cats to play and rest. You need to study in a quiet place, like your bedroom. A quiet place will help you only think about one thing, and you will learn better. Before you begin to study, do not forget to clean your desk. A good desk light is important, too. You'll feel tired easily if there is not enough light . So you should have a clean and bright lamp. To tell you the truth, the most important is that you should put your heart into your study. Question: The living-room is not a good place for study because it is too _ . Options: A: quiet B: noisy C: good D: clean A:","completion":"According to the information presented in the article, the living room is not considered to be a good place for students to study because it is too noisy. This information is derived from the lines in the article that express concern over the distractions that are prevalent in the living room area such as the ringing telephone, the television, and even pets that may be present. These elements contribute to the creation of a noisy environment that may hinder a student's ability to fully concentrate on their study materials, rendering the living room unsuitable for effective studying. Hence, the correct answer to the question \\"The living-room is not a good place for study because it is too _\\" would be option B: Noisy. A noisy environment could disrupt the concentration, create difficulty in absorbing and retaining information, and prevent the establishment of a rhythmic study pattern. To promote successful learning, the article suggests that students should study in a quieter place, like a bedroom, where fewer distractions exist. This might enable better focus on study materials and therefore facilitate better learning. Additionally, the article provides other beneficial study habits such as cleaning one's desk before starting to study to avoid distractions from disorganization, as well as providing a good desk light. A clean and organized study environment can help keep a student's focus on studying, while proper lighting can prevent strain and fatigue that can detrimentally impact a student's ability to study effectively. In conclusion, the article emphasizes that the most essential component of effective studying is the student's own dedication and interest in their study. Despite the importance of factors like a noise-free environment, a clean workspace, and proper lighting, ultimately, the most crucial factor in successful studying is the student's motivation and commitment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Build a movie plot around this: What if Burgess spares Anderton? PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Answer:","completion":"Title: The Precipice of Tomorrow Genre: Sci-Fi, Thriller Act 1: A Vision of Utopia In the near future, the Department of PreCrime has been successfully preventing all major crimes for several years, thanks to psychic technology that allows them to predict crimes before they happen. Led by the visionary Lamar Burgess, the department has gained widespread trust and support from the public, including its top PreCrime officer, John Anderton. Anderton, a staunch believer in the system after having lost his young son to a tragic kidnapping, works tirelessly to apprehend criminals before their actions can bring harm to innocent lives. However, he begins to harbor doubts about the infallibility of the system when he experiences vivid memories of his son during a routine criminal apprehension. Act 2: Echoes of Doubt During a high-profile investigation, the psychic PreCrime system identifies Anderton as a future murderer, set to kill a man named Leo Crow in just 48 hours. Shaken by the prediction, Anderton goes on the run to challenge the system and prove his innocence. Along the way, he befriends a young psychic, known as an \\"Agatha,\\" who had been exploited by the PreCrime department to generate the crime predictions. As Anderton and Agatha dig deeper into the secrets of PreCrime, they unveil dark truths about the system's inception and its founder, Lamar Burgess. They discover that Burgess had orchestrated a series of murders and cover-ups to maintain the organization's facade of perfection, including the death of Agatha's mother. Act 3: Tampering with Fate The film's climax approaches as Anderton confronts Burgess, who is about to kill his own accomplice, Danny Witwer, in order to tie up loose ends. With the psychic Agatha's help, Anderton exposes the truth behind the unsavory origin of PreCrime and shows the flaws in its system. In an unexpected twist, rather than arresting or killing Anderton as predicted, Burgess has a change of heart and spares him. Overcome with guilt and remorse, Burgess admits to his wrongdoings and helps Anderton and Agatha bring the truth to light. As a result, the once-revered PreCrime department becomes discredited and is shut down. Act 4: Reclaiming Humanity The aftermath of PreCrime's collapse leaves the city in a state of transition, grappling with the implications of their once trusted system. Agatha is finally freed from the oppressive confines of the department and begins to rebuild her life. Meanwhile, Anderton, now cleared of the false accusations against him, decides to use his skills and experience to help reform the justice system. As the story concludes, Anderton, the disillusioned PreCrime officer, and Agatha, the former tool of the very system she helped dismantle, join forces to develop a new approach to crime prevention that is grounded in fairness, empathy, and the innate possibility for redemption. Ultimately, \\"The Precipice of Tomorrow\\" serves as a cautionary tale that explores the complex relationship between technology, power, and the human condition — a gripping story in which the fight for a better future hinges on the courage to confront one's own past and the willingness to trust in the potential for change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.
