NATO leaders signed off Monday on President Barack Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters at the conclusion of a two-day summit of the alliance leaders that the plan calls for handing over security responsibilities to Afghan forces in 2013, then withdrawing foreign forces the following year. After that, a new and different NATO mission will advise, train and assist the expected 350,000-strong Afghanistan force, Rasmussen said. The plan is backed by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who sat down Monday to speak exclusively with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"That transition and the eventual withdrawal in 2014 of the U.S. forces and other OPTIONS: - Afghan forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Afghanistan forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Anders Fogh Rasmussen forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Barack Obama forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - CNN forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Chicago forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Hamid Karzai forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - NATO forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Obama forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Rasmussen forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - U.S. forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" - Wolf Blitzer forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\"","completion":"\\"That transition and the eventual withdrawal in 2014 of the U.S. forces and other NATO forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries.\\" I chose this sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the paragraph and mentions the key players involved.

Mars selects Larry's action figures, the Commando Elite, for the project and Irwin's educational toys, the Gorgonites, for their enemies, with the toyline expected to hit the market in three months. Faced with such a tight deadline, Benson forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's overly powerful X1000 microprocessor to control the toys. Teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group - Archer (Frank Langella) for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard (Tommy Lee Jones) for the Commando Elite. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), buys Chip as a birthday present for her brother Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite awaken and apparently destroy the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the AI circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with EMP shielding. Meanwhile, Chip and his squad pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer; unlike the Gorgonites, the Commando Elite do not understand they are just toys. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro (Clint Walker), whom he mortally wounds. The next day, Alan and Archer find the rest of the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the shop.

However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. Question: After doing the two experiments the researchers most probably concluded that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"seals can really make use of the acoustic signals to prey\\"?

During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside).

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The provided data presents information about an Indian cuisine restaurant known as The Phoenix, located in the riverside area. A comprehensive analysis of the data is given below: 1. Cuisine: Indian The Phoenix is a restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine, which is known for its rich flavors, colorful ingredients, and diverse culinary techniques. Indian cuisine boasts a wide range of dishes, characterized by the use of various spices, herbs, and vegetables, making it a popular choice among food enthusiasts. The Phoenix's menu is likely to offer a variety of traditional Indian dishes, including but not limited to, tandoor-cooked items, curries, biryanis, and various breads like naan, roti, and paratha. Indian restaurants have been consistently gaining popularity across the globe, with more and more people appreciating the unique and diverse tastes that Indian food has to offer. With a thriving spice trade history and numerous regional specialties, Indian cuisine is a reflection of its diverse culture. 2. Customer Rating: 1 out of 5 The Phoenix's customer rating is quite low with a score of just 1 out of 5. This suggests that the restaurant has not been able to meet the expectations of its clientele in areas such as food quality, taste, presentation, customer service, ambiance, or value for money. A low rating reflects negatively on any business and even more so for a restaurant, as it greatly influences the potential customers' decision-making when selecting a dining option. The Phoenix, with its poor rating, might struggle to attract new customers and maintain a loyal customer base, which could affect its overall revenue generation and success. It is important for the management of The Phoenix to closely examine customer feedback and reviews to address the specific concerns raised by customers and work on improving the overall dining experience. Potential areas of improvement may include enhancing food quality, flavor consistency, portion sizes, presentation, staff training, and service delivery. 3. Location: Riverside area The Phoenix is situated in the riverside area, which can impart a picturesque and serene environment to its customers. Restaurants with proximity to natural attractions, such as picturesque rivers, lakes, or oceans, often provide a unique dining experience enhanced by the scenic views. The riverside location offers an excellent opportunity for The Phoenix to capitalize on the ambiance and provide customers with comfortable outdoor seating arrangements, potentially drawing more patrons to enjoy their meals while taking in the calming views and sounds of the nearby river. A riverside location can potentially attract not only local residents but also tourists who wish to experience a pleasant dining experience in a natural setting. Therefore, investing in creating a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere that complements the location can be an asset for the restaurant. In conclusion, The Phoenix is a riverside Indian cuisine restaurant that seemingly has certain areas that require significant improvement, especially considering the low customer rating of 1 out of 5. An immediate action plan should be implemented to identify and address the root causes of the unsatisfactory rating to ensure a better customer experience. The riverside location, if utilized effectively, can be a USP for The Phoenix, which could help turn its fortunes around in the competitive food and restaurant industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From today, all 30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours – instead of just parents and carers. Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson said it was a ‘1950’s mindset’ which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done. From today, all 30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours - instead of just parents and carers. But employment lawyers predicted a huge surge in the number of workplace grievances and rising ‘resentment’ between workers who get what they want and those who lose out. And business groups reminded employees that the ‘work still needs to be done’. The new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed. It allows workers to demand part time hours, compressed hours, working from home or job sharing. Miss Swinson, who has just returned from maternity leave said: ‘Sometimes, because this has been a right to request that only parents have had, that can create, in some workplaces, a bit of tension when parents get special treatment.’ She said workers could benefit with compressed hours, commuting outside rush hour and or working from home. ‘Employers often find that this leads to employees being much more motivated, productive, less likely to leave. So that cuts down their staff recruitment costs. It really can be a win-win’, she told the Independent on Sunday. ‘You get staff that are happy and more productive and the employers benefit from that as well. And lots of businesses are very positive about this. ‘We live in a globalised society, we have technology which enables us to be doing work not just from physically being there at the workplace but actually doing so at different times of the day and from different places. ‘And rather than it staying stuck in a 1950s mind-set that being at work is about physically being somewhere and it’s about long hours and that ‘presenteeism’ culture, actually it’s about achieving what you’re supposed to do in your job and doing that in the most effective way. Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson said it was a '1950's mindset' which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done. ‘So flexibility isn’t a special case; flexibility is just the way that organisations work and they recognise that they can benefit from that.’ But employment lawyers said the new rules could lead to a raft of new complaints from those who lose out. Fraser Younson, an employment law specialist and partner at the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said: ‘We’ve already started to see an increase in the number of grievances filed by people who feel they are having to make up the work of colleagues working flexibly because they have children. ‘With everyone able to request flexible working, the number of grievances is only set to rise.’ A survey by the firm found 84pc of employers expect the new right to cause resentment among staff. More than half predict the change will adversely affect the day-to-day running of businesses. Companies have the right to refuse a request for flexible working if there is a valid business reason, such as the changes creating extra costs. There are also concerns about how the new rules will work – as requests will be considered in the order they are received and not on merit. The new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed. It allows workers to demand part time hours, compressed hours, working from home or job sharing. As a result, someone wanting time off for a lie in or a hobby could win out simply if they get their request in first. Employers have been told they cannot judge applications on merit and should ‘pull the names out of a hat’ if two people ask for the same thing and both cannot be accommodated. Mr Younson added: ‘It says all requests should be considered equally but what if one request is from a parent and one is from an athlete who wants to train every day?’. Experts have also warned some workers may come to see the rules as a ‘right to have’ instead of a right to ask. Under the existing rules, around three out of five requests are granted and a further one in four after negotiation with employers. Neil Carberry, the CBI director for employment and skills, welcomed the new rules but added: ‘It’s important to remember that the work still needs to be done, so businesses will have to manage conflicting requests effectively and they retain the right to say no where the company just can’t make it work.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is about how workers in Britain now have the right to ask for flexible working hours. This means they can ask to work part-time, have different hours, work from home, or share their job with someone else. The minister who supports this idea, Jo Swinson, thinks it will make workers happier and help them do their jobs better. But, some people worry it may cause problems between workers who get different schedules and make it difficult for businesses to run smoothly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: 10 Things I Hate About You is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy-drama film directed by Gil Junger and starring Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Larisa Oleynik. The screenplay, written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith, is a loose modernization of William Shakespeare's late-16th century comedy The Taming of the Shrew, retold in a late-1990s American high school setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca Stratford (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on dating, attempts to get bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat Stratford (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the Seattle metropolitan area, with many scenes shot at Stadium High School in Tacoma. Question: was 10 things i hate about you based on shakespeare?","completion":"Yes, \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is based on William Shakespeare's play \\"The Taming of the Shrew.\\" While the 1999 film is a modern-day adaptation and presents a distinct setting from Shakespeare's original work, many elements of the Bard's comedy can still be found in the movie. The film serves as a loose modernization of the late-16th-century play, retelling the story in a late-1990s American high school setting. The characters in \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" parallel those from Shakespeare's play. For instance, the Stratford sisters, Bianca and Kat, resemble the original characters, Bianca and Katherina. The film also retains the general premise around navigating strict dating rules, where new student Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to bypass those rules by convincing bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to date the ill-tempered sister, Kat (Julia Stiles). While the script by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith creatively adapts the backbone of Shakespeare's comedy, the film connects with a broader range of themes, such as the struggles and life of teenagers in the late 1990s. \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is able to entertain, engage, and speak to audiences despite altering the original source material. In conclusion, \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is based on William Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" though presented as a loose adaptation. The film features resemblances and parallels that keep the essence of the original play alive while presenting a fresh, modern take on the iconic story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential auteurs of all time, and is most famous for films such as \\"The Seventh Seal\\" (1957), \\"Wild Strawberries\\" (1957), \\"Persona\\" (1966), \\"Cries and Whispers\\" (1972) and \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" (1982). - The Seventh Seal is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \\"Wood Painting\\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\".

Last Sunday evening, we invited some people home for dinner. I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang. Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom. The guests arrived. I introduced my two daughters to each of them. The adults were nice and kind and said how lucky we were to have such good kids. Each of the guests made a particular fuss over Kelly, the younger one, admiring her dress, her hair and her smile. They said she was a remarkable girl to be carrying coats upstairs at her age. I thought to myself that we adults usually _ the younger one because she's the one who seems more easily hurt. We do it with the best of intentions. But we seldom think of how it might affect the other child. I was a little worried that Kristen would feel she was being outshined. I was about to serve dinner when I realized that she had been missing for twenty minutes. I ran upstairs and found her in the bedroom, crying. I said, \\"What are you doing, my dear?\\" She turned to me with a sad expression and said, \\"Mommy, why don't people like me the way they like my sister? Is it because I'm not pretty?

And it was a super cool book . There were a lot of things different in the movie , some forgivable , others just plain sucked . What is likely true about the narrator ?","completion":"Based on the text provided, we can infer several things about the narrator: 1. Familiarity with the original work: The narrator has most likely read the book \\"I Am Legend\\" and is familiar with its content and storyline. They mention that the book, written about 50 years ago, is \\"a super cool book.\\" This shows their appreciation for the original source material. 2. Disappointment in the adaptation: The narrator expresses dissatisfaction with the movie version, stating that \\"once again Hollywood fucked up a great story.\\" This indicates they hold strong opinions about film adaptations of literary works and possibly have a history of being disappointed with Hollywood's treatment of such stories. 3. Distinct taste in films: The narrator refers to the film as \\"pretty okay,\\" suggesting they had tempered expectations given the adaptation from the book. It implies that they can appreciate aspects of movies even if they don't wholly enjoy them. 4. Critical perspective: The narrator acknowledges that there are discrepancies between the book and the film, with some being \\"forgivable\\" and others being disappointing. This showcases their ability to recognize and critique the differences between adaptations in a mature manner. 5. Possibly a fan of science fiction: Given that \\"I Am Legend\\" is a post-apocalyptic horror novel written in 1954 by Richard Matheson, and that the narrator enjoys the book, it is likely that the narrator is a fan of science fiction or similar genres. They likely have an interest in stories with themes like survival, potential human extinction, and explorations of human nature. 6. Desire for faithful adaptations: Considering their lamentations on Hollywood's mishandling of the story, it is reasonable to assume that the narrator values authenticity and accuracy when it comes to adapting works from one medium to another. They prefer the original ideas and artistic vision to be maintained and respected during the adaptation process. In conclusion, the narrator appears to be a knowledgeable reader who prefers accurate and faithful adaptations of literary works into films and holds strong opinions regarding Hollywood's handling of such adaptations.

Lance had a crush on Becky since the third grade but was too shy to talk to her. When he learned that the lead male in the school play would share a kiss with Becky, who was the main actress, he decided to audition for the part. It's evident that Lance's motivation to be a part of the school play, particularly as the lead male, was driven by his romantic interest in Becky. By securing the role, Lance hoped not only to get the opportunity to share a kiss with her, but also, possibly, to impress her and establish a connection with her that he had been unable to achieve due to his shyness. In this scenario, Lance's aspirations to be a part of the school play were not solely based on an interest in theater or thespian pursuits, but rather, they were motivated by his romantic feelings for Becky.

Parliamentary colleagues have confirmed Mr Higgins' stance. He's informed party officials that he does not want to present at future meetings where Mr Tollner be in attendance. According to the NT News, the territory's Deputy Chief Minister is accused of calling Joshua Higgins a 'pillow biter' and 'shirt lifter'. Scroll down for video. NT Minister Dave Tollner has resigned as Deputy Chief and moved to the backbench after calling the son of a Country Liberal Party colleague a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter' Mr Higgins is a staff member working for Community Services Minister, Bess Price. It's been reported that the verbal attack occurred in the wake of a draft speech having been presented to cabinet ministers. The Chief Minister Adam Giles has bought into the latest scandal to beset his party, calling his deputy's comments 'inappropriate and not acceptable'. Reports in the NT News suggest Health Minister Robyn Lambley was also dragged into the controversy, admonishing Mr Tollner in front of cabinet colleagues and demanding he apologise. Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, has since announced he has accepted Mr Tollner's apology after originally threatening to boycott all Country Liberal Party meetings. 'Mr Tollner has apologised for his comments,' Mr Giles added. 'The Treasurer has told me that he did not intend to cause harm or offence with these comments and I know the individual concerned has accepted Mr Tollner’s apology.' Mr Giles believes the matter has been dealt with despite Mr Higgins' contention that he will not attend party room meetings should Dave Tollner be present. 'The person in question is a valued staff member and has met with me and expressed a desire to move on and that’s what we now intend to do,' Mr Giles said. Senior party officials disagree though, hinting at disciplinary action being the most appropriate action. One says that the CLP 'team is not cohesive'. The Chief Minister has not been immune from controversy either. Adam Giles led a party room challenge in March last year, toppling Terry Mills from the top job. This would ultimately sparked another internal revolt. Three of the party's indigenous members quit the party, pushing Mr Giles perilously close to leading a minority government. Ironically, it's only the victory (despite a massive swing against them) in Mr Mills' former seat of Blain which has the CLP clinging to a one-seat majority in parliament.

Plot title: Under Capricorn Movie plot: In 1831, Sydney is a frontier town, full of rough ex-convicts from the British Isles. The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections. Gradually, Charles restores Henrietta's self-confidence. They become closer and closer, and eventually they share a passionate kiss. But Henrietta explains that she and Sam are bound together most profoundly: when she was young, Sam was the handsome stable boy. Overcome with desire, they ran away and married at Gretna Green. Henrietta's brother, furious that aristocratic Henrietta had paired up with a lowly servant, confronted them. Her brother shot at them and missed; she then shot her brother fatally. Sam made a false confession to save her, and was sent to the penal colony in Australia. She followed him and waited seven years in abject poverty for his release. After listening to Milly's greatly exaggerated stories of what Charles did in Lady Henrietta's bedroom, Sam becomes furious and... My question: Who shot and killed Henrietta's brother?

Wanting to marry his new fiancée Charlotte, he needs to obtain a final divorce from his first wife Patricia who left him some years earlier. Patricia now lives with a semi-Westernised tribe in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Michael travels there to get her signature on divorce papers, but upon arriving, discovers that he has a 13-year-old son named Mimi-Siku. Michael attempts to bond with Mimi-Siku in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York \\"when he is a man.\\" Michael is also given a new name, Baboon, as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi-Siku undergoes the traditional rite of passage of his tribe, who then considers him to be a man.

Context: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats.

There is a polar ice cap and channels that were once filled with water. Curiosity has found evidence of a flowing stream. Q: What two structures are found on mars? A: Answer:","completion":"The two structures found on Mars are volcanoes and canyons. The Martian surface, as mentioned in the provided paragraph, features a varied landscape that includes various geological formations such as polar ice caps, channels that were once filled with water, and evidence of a flowing stream discovered by the Curiosity rover. Volcanoes on Mars are particularly noteworthy due to their size and prominence. For instance, Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, is located on Mars. It stretches about 13.6 miles high and 370 miles across, making it nearly two and a half times the height of Mount Everest and comparably sized to the entire country of France. The extreme size of Olympus Mons and other volcanoes on Mars can likely be attributed to the planet's thinner crust and lower gravity, allowing for the prolonged buildup of volcanic materials. Another prominent geological feature on Mars is its vast network of canyons. The most famous is Valles Marineris, a gargantuan canyon system that stretches over 2,500 miles across the Martian surface. It is the largest canyon in the solar system and approximately ten times longer and five times deeper than the Grand Canyon on Earth. The formation of Valles Marineris and similar canyons on Mars still remains a topic of scientific debate, with theories ranging from tectonic activity to erosion caused by flowing water. Overall, the presence of volcanoes and canyons on Mars reveals a rich and diverse geological history for the Red Planet. These features continue to capture the interest and imagination of scientists, as they offer valuable insight into Mars's past, present, and potential future. The study of these formations also has significant implications for human exploration and potential colonization of Mars in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A similar operation undertaken by their counterparts in Stockholm has just ended in failure. American college students Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams), Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz), Jules Louden (Anna Hutchison), and Curt Vaughan (Chris Hemsworth) are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest, a cabin recently acquired by Vaughan's cousin. From their underground facility, where they possess significant technological control over the area in which the cabin is situated, Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the teenagers by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that hinder rational thinking and increase libido. They take bets from the different facility departments on what kind of monster will attack the teenagers and discuss the failures of similar rituals in other nations. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds many bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the journal, inadvertently summoning the zombified Buckner family despite Mikalski's warnings. By releasing pheromones, Hadley successfully induces Curt and Jules to have sex. Attacked by the marauding Buckner zombies, Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes to alert the group. Marty, a frequent marijuana smoker, discovers concealed surveillance equipment before being dragged off by one of the Buckners and apparently killed. Later, the Facility workers learn that the ritual in Japan has also ended in failure, ending Japan's streak of success, and confirming that the American ritual is humanity's last hope.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct in the context of sports, but it doesn't provide the full meaning of the term \\"Meister\\" in German. Allow me to give you a detailed and long answer to better understand the meaning and usage of the word \\"Meister.\\" In German, the term \\"Meister\\" is derived from the Old High German word \\"meistar,\\" meaning a master or expert in a field.

Master or expert: In a general sense, \\"Meister\\" is often used to describe someone who is a master or expert in their profession or field of study. For example, a highly skilled craftsman, artist, or musician could be referred to as a \\"Meister\\" in their respective field. 2. Sports championships: As you mentioned in your question, “Meister” is also commonly used in sports to refer to the current national, European, or world champion. In this context, \\"Deutscher Meister\\" means the German champion, \\"Europameister\\" is the European champion, and \\"Weltmeister\\" denotes the world champion. 3. Master craftsman or tradesperson: In the professional realm, particularly in skilled trades and crafts, \\"Meister\\" is used to designate a master craftsman or tradesperson. In Germany and other German-speaking countries, certain trades require a person to pass a rigorous examination called the \\"Meisterprüfung\\" to become a \\"Meister.\\" This confers a high level of respect and recognition in their profession as well as the ability to train apprentices and run their own business. 4. Titles and honorifics: The term \\"Meister\\" can also be used as part of a title or honorific for distinguished individuals. For instance, famous composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven are often referred to as \\"Meister\\" in recognition of their mastery and contributions to the field of music. 5. In literature and arts: In literary and artistic contexts, \\"Meister\\" can be used to refer to an influential or masterful work, such as Goethe's \\"Faust,\\" which is often called \\"Goethes Meisterwerk\\" (Goethe's masterpiece).

When I was boarding at Wells Cathedral School I'd really enjoyed acting, so after I'd flunked my A-levels and spent eight months in Hong Kong, staying with my father who was in the Air Force, I returned to the UK to pursue my dream. By the time I was 19, about six months after I'd finished at Redroofs Stage School in Maidenhead, I went for my first film audition as an actor. I was living in a not very nice part of Maidenhead, renting a room for Â£38 a week and working in a nightclub while applying for work. The day I went up for the audition in London was very exciting. It was for a Channel 4 film called Closing Numbers with Jane Asher. I hadn't done a film audition before so I met the director Stephen Whittaker and read for him. He said he wasn't entirely sure I was suitable for the role but promised to call me later. As I caught the train back from London to Maidenhead that afternoon I picked up a newspaper that had been left on the seat and it randomly fell open on the horoscopes page. The advice for Aries, my star sign, was sage. 'Something you do today will colour not only the next few days but the months and the years ahead,' it read. I thought, 'Well, that sounds good to me.' I tore out the horoscope, put it in my wallet and went home. In the end I did get the job, and spent three days filming in Bushey near Watford. As it was such a small part, I didn't get a car to pick me up and rather embarrassingly I was late on my first day and kept Jane Asher waiting for 45 minutes. Unfortunately, after Closing Numbers I didn't get another role in film or TV for a long time, but I kept that clipping in my wallet and it became my mantra as a reminder not to give up. I slogged away in rep theatre gradually learning my craft - I didn't feel I had any other options - and when I wasn't acting I'd work in factories just to keep the money coming in. Kris (left) in Closing Numbers in 1993, he believe he owes the role to a horoscope. Then, just as my career began to blossom - much to the relief of my parents, who thought acting was just a passing phase - I lost the clipping. But it had served its purpose, inspiring me to keep plugging away when times were tough. My latest role in Death In Paradise is a fantastic job. Spending six months in a beautiful place like Guadeloupe, working with a great cast and dodging hurricanes is a dream come true. I'd never been a fan of astrology and to be honest I don't believe anyone could make predictions for one-twelfth of the population, but on that day those random words in a newspaper really struck a chord with me. I can still quote them, that's how much of an impression they made. I'd like to think it was my persistence and talent that got me where I am... but who knows, maybe it was written in the stars too. Series three of Death In Paradise is out now on DVD and available to buy from www.bbcshop.com.

Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners.

Answer:","completion":"Title Suggestion: \\"Against the Tide: A Fight for Love and Equality\\" This title captures the essence of the movie plot, reflecting the struggle that Lieutenant Laurel Hester has to go through in order to ensure her domestic partner, Stacie Andree, receives the pension benefits she deserves. Set against the backdrop of Ocean County, New Jersey, the story highlights the issues faced by the LGBT community in fighting for equal rights and recognition. The phrase \\"Against the Tide\\" signifies the uphill battle that Laurel and her supporters face while going up against the Ocean County Freeholders, who are reluctant to extend pension benefits to domestic partners. It also symbolizes the collective determination of those involved to challenge societal norms and effect change for the better. The subtitle, \\"A Fight for Love and Equality,\\" emphasizes the driving forces behind the struggle: Laurel's unwavering love for Stacie, and the pursuit of equality for the LGBT community as a whole. This battle isn't only about securing financial security for Stacie but also represents a much larger fight for equal rights in the face of discrimination. Combining these elements, \\"Against the Tide: A Fight for Love and Equality\\" evokes the spirit of resilience, determination, and the power of love in overcoming adversity and injustice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day. To this day, I can remember Mr. Broaches' cheerful cry of \\"Well done!\\" whenever I got a problem right. I shall always be thankful that our paths crossed.

Q: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia. \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement.

He turned his head suddenly to the wall. Mr. Thorndike stood irresolute, and then sank back into his chair. The first man in the line was already at the railing, and the questions put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and a court attendant.

Question 1: Why is car ownership so high in San Marino? Question 2: How could I gain 3300 dollars per year to pay the fees of good education for my 4 year-old son? [I] no; [II] yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Why is car ownership so high in San Marino? Answer: Car ownership is high in San Marino primarily due to a combination of factors including its small size, its economic prosperity, and the country's infrastructure. San Marino is a small landlocked state situated within Italy, with a total area of just 61 square kilometers. This makes it one of the smallest countries in the world. Because of this, getting around the country is relatively easy and convenient by car. Public transportation options are limited to a small number of bus routes, which may be less convenient for residents, especially those living outside urban centers. Therefore, owning a car in San Marino is essential for many citizens in order to get around more freely. San Marino boasts a high GDP per capita and a robust economy, primarily driven by tourism, banking, and the manufacturing sector. The country's affluent population enjoys a good standard of living, allowing many residents to be able to afford a vehicle for personal use. Additionally, San Marino has a low population density, which means that there is less traffic congestion, making car ownership more appealing for residents. Finally, San Marino's road infrastructure is well developed, with well-maintained roads and designated parking spaces. This further incentivizes car ownership, as it allows people to easily and comfortably navigate the country by car. Question 2: How could I gain 3300 dollars per year to pay the fees of good education for my 4-year-old son? Answer: There are numerous ways to generate an additional 3,300 per year to cover your child's educational expenses. Here are some potential strategies: 1. Increase your income: You might consider asking for a salary increase at your current job, pursuing additional professional development opportunities to qualify for a higher-paying role, or even scouting for a new job that pays better. 2. Part-time or freelance work: Find part-time or freelance work in your field of expertise, or leverage your hobbies and special skills to create extra income. This could be anything from working in retail during evenings or weekends, offering tutoring or consulting services, or even selling handmade items online. 3. Rent out a room or property: If you own your home and have extra space, consider renting out a room or an unused garage on a long-term basis or through platforms like Airbnb for short-term stays. 4. Invest in a passive income stream: Invest in stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds that generate passive income through dividends or capital gains. 5. Cut back on expenses: Analyze your current budget and identify areas where you can reduce or eliminate spending to save the extra money needed for education fees. This could include cutting back on dining out, switching to a more affordable cable or phone plan, or opting for less expensive entertainment options. To sum up, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 addresses car ownership in San Marino, while Question 2 is focused on generating additional income to cover educational expenses for a child."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Along with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims had always been a minority within the subcontinent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although Gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership. The British, extremely weakened by the Second World War, promised that they would leave and participated in the formation of an interim government. The British Indian territories gained independence in 1947, after being partitioned into the Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. Following the controversial division of pre-partition Punjab and Bengal, rioting broke out between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in these provinces and spread to several other parts of India, leaving some 500,000 dead. Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively). In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan.

Is By September, the UN Command controlled the Pusan perimeter, enclosing about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the statement provided is a good answer to the question. The body of water that served as a natural border for the UN command-controlled Pusan perimeter was the Nakdong River. To provide a more detailed response: In the early stages of the Korean War, North Korean forces advanced rapidly into South Korea, nearly conquering the entire Korean Peninsula. However, the United Nations Command (UNC), comprised mainly of American, South Korean, and other allied nations' forces, managed to establish a defensive line known as the Pusan perimeter. The Pusan perimeter was a 140-mile (225-kilometer) long defensive line in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula that enclosed about 10% of Korea. This defensive line stretched from the city of Pusan (now Busan) on the southeastern coast, up to the Nakdong River, and to the city of Taegu (now Daegu). The Nakdong River played an essential role in the perimeter by providing a natural border and a strategic advantage to the defending UN forces. At the time, the Nakdong River was approximately 305 miles (490 kilometers) long and flowed through the rugged terrain of South Korea. The river served as a natural barrier against the North Korean forces, making it challenging for them to advance further south. Throughout August and early September 1950, the UN Command fought several battles inside and along the Pusan perimeter to defend it from invasion by the North Korean forces. These battles witnessed fierce combat, and UNC forces relied on the natural protection of the river, terrain, and other barriers to their advantage. By September 1950, the UN Command successfully maintained control of the Pusan Perimeter and managed to hold off the North Korean forces long enough for General Douglas MacArthur to turn the tide of the war with the battle-changing Incheon Landing on September 15, 1950."},{"prompt":"What is the last name of the person that drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments? Answer the above question based on the context below: The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\"According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: An overall healthy lifestyle, including a healthy and balanced diet, can help you better manage stress and make you feel better in general. Part of eating a balanced diet requires you to make good choices about what kinds of foods you eat and how much you eat in each meal. For each meal, approximately half of your plate should consist of fruits and vegetables. Most adults should be eating six to eight ounces of grains each day. When you eat grains, choose whole grains instead of refined grains. Make sure you eat five to six-and-a-half ounces of lean protein each day, depending on your age and sex. That can include tofu, beans, eggs, nuts/seeds, poultry, fish, or lean meat. Try to limit yourself to five or six teaspoons of oil (or the equivalent) each day. When you do use oils, opt for plant-based oils (like coconut, palm oil, and olive oil), as these have very little if any cholesterol. Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and aim to get about three cups of dairy (or non-dairy substitutes) per day. . Your quantity and quality of sleep can affect your ability to cope with stress throughout the day. Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night, and take steps to ensure that the sleep that you get is restful. Most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep, though some individuals may need even more sleep to feel fully rested. Follow a sleep schedule, even on weekends and before days off. Find something to do before bed that relaxes you. Try to make it a nightly ritual. Block light out of your room using thick curtains or blinds. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, as it can easily interrupt your normal sleep schedule. Alcohol can also affect your sleep. It's best to avoid drinking in order to protect your quality of sleep. Turn off or avoid all electronic products at least 30 minutes before bed. The glare of a cellphone, computer, tablet, or television screen can suppress your body's melatonin production and upset your circadian rhythm. Keep your room on the cool side, but not so cold that you're uncomfortable. Experts generally recommend keeping your bedroom between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 19.5 degrees Celsius), but if you need it slightly warmer go with what's most comfortable. Many people believe that indulging in drugs or alcohol will help relieve stress. While the temporary euphoria associated with intoxication may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually create far more problems than it's worth. Getting intoxicated instead of working through stressful situations can cause you to have trouble dealing with stress in the future. Over time it reduces your ability to successfully cope with your day-to-day stress. Drinking or doing drugs to cope with stress can quickly lead to addiction and dependency. In addition to addiction, drug and alcohol abuse can also lead to other health problems. Rather than seeking a quick \\"solution,\\" it's best to learn how to cope with stress and find healthier ways to relax and calm down. One of the best lifestyle changes you can make to reduce stress and feel happier in general is to practice gratitude. Practicing gratitude does not mean ignoring your problems or pretending they don't exist. Instead, you work to change the way you approach day-to-day stress. Any time you find yourself feeling stressed, think about all the things in your life that you have to be grateful for. Think about your family and friends, your health, the beauty of nature, and the personal experiences that helped you become the strong and talented individual you are today. In stressful situations, it may feel like the pressures of work will never let up. You may feel exhausted, anxious, or even angry, and in the moment it may seem like the problems you experienced that day are the most important thing in the world. However, it's important to step back and remember that most of the problems you experience on a day-to-day basis will be quickly forgotten about and won't have any lasting impact on your life. Ask yourself how important a given problem really is. Consider whether that problem will matter in a day, a week, a month, or a year. Any problems that won't impact your life beyond the short term are generally not worth worrying about. It's a waste of time and energy that could have been spent doing something calming and enjoyable. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a shorter version of a bigger story or explanation. In this case, to be healthy and feel better, you should eat a balanced diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Get enough sleep and create a comfy sleep environment. Stay away from drugs and alcohol, as they can lead to more problems. Practice being thankful for all the good things in your life and remember that many daily problems won't matter in the long run. This will help you manage stress and feel happier."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the following passage \\"If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the drummers of Warsaw? , can you please find it? On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August... A:","completion":"The drummers for the band Warsaw were mentioned as Terry Mason, Tony Tabac, and Steve Brotherdale. Here's how I extracted the information: 1.

Steve Brotherdale was named as Tabac's replacement: \\"Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale,\\" indicating that he also played drums for the band.

Having heard several complimentary comments about the organization and efficiency of the place, I decided to see for myself. In spite of arriving early, I found that there were already long queues at the reception desks. While I was waiting, I looked around and had to admit that it is an impressive building: large and light with marble everywhere. Eventually my turn came and I presented my doctor's letters to the receptionist, who informed me that I was in the X-ray queue and I'd have to go to another queue and start again! I couldn't believe it and asked her if it might be possible to give me an appointment card anyway without making me queue up again. She informed me it was no good arguing with her and I should have read the sign, an almost invisible piece of card saying \\"X-rays\\" just in front of her where very few people can have seen it. No matter how hard I tried to persuade her, she wouldn't give me an appointment card for a blood test, so I started queuing again and finally got the card at 8: 30! I then set off for the blood test room, following the nice new signs until they suddenly stopped and I realized that I was in a part of the hospital that hasn't been finished yet! When I got to the door I saw a notice saying \\"Back in 10 minutes\\". I sat down and waited for 30 minutes before a doctor appeared and told me to come in without, of course, apologizing for keeping me waiting. I asked him why I'd had to wait and he explained he'd had to help out in another ward which was understaffed as a result of a flu epidemic among the doctors! I got out of the hospital at 9:45 a.m. and breathed a sigh of relief. I'm now waiting for the results. So, Mrs. Culley, a far from rosy picture.

In countries like Mexico, Belgium, Germany, and Austria, the philosophy of the law suggests that it is human nature to want to escape, and escapees who do not break any other laws are not charged for anything, and no extra time is added to their sentence. Specifically, in the case of Germany, it is not considered illegal to break out of jail provided that the escape is non-violent, and the escapee does not commit any other crimes or offenses during the escape attempt. This approach stems from the belief that it is human nature to seek freedom, and therefore, the action of attempting to escape from confinement should not be penalized as long as it is done without causing harm to others or property. However, it is important to note that although the act of breaking out of jail may not be illegal itself, any related actions, such as causing damage to property, using violence against prison personnel or other inmates, or seeking assistance from other inmates or prison officials, would be considered illegal and could lead to additional charges or an extension of the individual's sentence. In summary, while it may not be explicitly illegal to break out of jail in Germany if the escape is non-violent and no other laws are broken, any associated criminal actions taken during or as a result of the escape attempt can still be prosecuted under the law."},{"prompt":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the album that was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts?

Rainfall is a crucial aspect of the Earth's water cycle and a significant weather parameter. It directly influences the environment, agriculture, and the availability of water resources in a specific region. When we say that a patch of land gets six inches of rainfall each month, it essentially implies the volume of water that falls on that area in the form of precipitation - mainly rain. In the context of the given options, 'gathered moisture' best describes the amount of rain received by that patch of land. As moisture from various sources such as bodies of water or humidity in the air condenses and accumulates in the atmosphere, it eventually gets heavy enough to fall to the ground due to gravity. This process is called precipitation, and it results in rainfall. The accumulation of six inches of rainfall refers to the vertical height of water expected to have fallen on the ground if all of the rain remains in place and doesn't evaporate, percolate into the soil, or run off due to various factors. It showcases the overall amount of gathered moisture in the form of rainfall that the particular area receives. On the other hand, the terms 'storm', 'quiet', and 'puddles' are not accurate or closely related in this context. A storm can be a complex meteorological event that might bring rain, but it is not a measure of rainfall itself. 'Quiet' is unrelated to the topic since it is a term used to describe a situation with little or no noise. Lastly, 'puddles' refer to small, shallow pools of water formed by rainwater on the ground, but they are more a consequence of rainfall rather than a measurement of the rainfall itself. In conclusion, the statement \\"If a patch of land gets six inches of rainfall each month, then that is the amount of gathered moisture\\" accurately represents the idea that the given figure refers to the quantity of water condensed from the atmosphere and precipitating onto the land during the respective period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How can I attract women? How can I attract girls? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Although the questions \\"How can I attract women?\\" and \\"How can I attract girls?\\" seem to be similar on the surface, they have slightly different connotations. The term \\"women\\" usually refers to adult females, while \\"girls\\" typically describes females who are younger, perhaps in their adolescence or early adulthood. Nonetheless, the basic principles of attraction often apply to both groups, though with certain nuances depending on the specific stage of life and individual preferences. Here is a detailed and long answer to the broader question of attracting females: 1. Self-confidence: Confidence is universally attractive, regardless of gender. Being comfortable in your own skin and displaying self-assurance will make you appealing to others. To boost your self-confidence, focus on cultivating a positive self-image, setting realistic expectations, and working towards personal growth. 2. Good grooming and hygiene: Maintaining good personal hygiene and taking care of your appearance are essential to creating a positive first impression. Shower regularly, wear clean and well-fitted clothes, groom your hair, and trim your facial hair (if applicable). A neat and well-kept appearance demonstrates respect for yourself and others. 3. Body language: Non-verbal communication plays a key role in attraction. Stand tall, make eye contact, smile genuinely, and maintain an open body language. A posture that conveys openness and confidence will make you more approachable and attractive to others. 4. Develop yourcommunication skills: Being able to engage in interesting and meaningful conversations is crucial. Develop your listening skills and show genuine interest in the other person's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Avoid dominating the conversation or turning it into a monologue. A balance of sharing and listening will make for more engaging interaction. 5. Show genuine interest: To attract someone, it’s essential to make them feel valued and understood. Ask open-ended questions that encourage her to share more about herself, and genuinely listen to what she has to say. Make an effort to remember details about her and bring them up in future conversations. 6. Sense of humor: A good sense of humor can be incredibly attractive. Make an effort to share light-hearted moments, funny stories, or jokes (while being mindful of her preferences and boundaries). Laughter can help build connections and put others at ease. 7. Self-improvement: Continuously work on improving yourself, both internally and externally. This includes working on your emotional intelligence, pursuing hobbies you enjoy, expanding your knowledge, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. An attractive individual is someone who is always seeking personal growth and self-awareness. 8. Respect and understanding: Always treat women with respect and understanding, regardless of the situation. Demonstrate empathy and be kind, compassionate, supportive, and considerate. Avoid objectifying or degrading remarks. A respectful demeanor is highly attractive. 9. Genuine and authentic: Be true to yourself and avoid trying to put up a façade to attract others. Authenticity is endearing; don't be afraid to showcase your unique qualities and quirks. Embrace who you are and let others see the real you. 10. Create a sense of mystery: People are often attracted to those who have an air of intrigue or mystery. While it's essential to be open and honest, avoid revealing every detail about yourself too quickly. Allow the other person to discover more about you over time, maintaining an element of curiosity. Keep in mind that attraction is subjective, and what might be appealing to one person might not be appealing to another. While it is important to work on these aspects of personal growth, it is equally important to remember that authentic connections cannot be forced. By being genuine, respectful, and confident, you increase your chances of attracting others who are drawn to these qualities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. Question: What is the purpose of sending young tigers to South Africa? Options: A: To help the tigers recover their ability to live in the wild. B: To provide them with a better environment.

Answer based on context: The Thái Nguyên uprising in 1917 has been described as the \\"largest and most destructive\\" anti-colonial rebellion in French Indochina between the Pacification of Tonkin in the 1880s and the Nghe-Tinh Revolt of 1930-31. On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region. The rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards. The initial success of the rebels was short-lived. They managed to control the prison and the town's administrative buildings for six days, but were all expelled on the seventh day by French government reinforcements. According to French reports 107 were killed on the colonial side and fifty-six on the anti-colonial, including Quyen. French forces were not able to pacify the surrounding countryside until six months later. Can reportedly committed suicide in January 1918 to avoid capture.

Background: Kenneth Elton Kesey (; September 17, 1935 - November 10, 2001) as Ken Kesey was an American novelist, essayist, and countercultural figure. He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s. Context: While still enrolled at the University of Oregon in 1957, Kesey wrote End of Autumn; according to Rick Dogson, the novel \\"focused on the exploitation of college athletes by telling the tale of a football lineman who was having second thoughts about the game.\\" Although Kesey came to regard the unpublished work as juvenilia, an excerpt served as his Stanford Creative Writing Center application sample. During his Woodrow Wilson Fellowship year, Kesey wrote Zoo, a novel about the beatniks living in the North Beach community of San Francisco, but it was never published. The inspiration for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came while working on the night shift with Gordon Lish at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital. There, Kesey often spent time talking to the patients, sometimes under the influence of the hallucinogenic drugs with which he had volunteered to experiment. Kesey did not believe that these patients were insane, but rather that society had pushed them out because they did not fit the conventional ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave. Published under the guidance of Cowley in 1962, the novel was an immediate success; in 1963, it was adapted into a successful stage play by Dale Wasserman, and in 1975, Milos Forman directed a screen adaptation, which won the \\"Big Five\\" Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman). Kesey originally was involved in creating the film, but left two weeks into production. He claimed never to have seen the movie because of a dispute over the 20,000 he was initially paid for the film rights. Kesey loathed the fact that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by the Chief Bromden character, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson's being cast as Randle McMurphy (he wanted Gene Hackman). Despite this, Faye Kesey has stated that her husband was generally supportive of the film and pleased that it was made. Question: What year was the novel written?

Initially it was a localized feud between supporters of Gebhard and those of the Catholic core of the Cathedral Chapter. With the election of Ernst of Bavaria as a competing archbishop, what had been a local conflict expanded in scale: Ernst's election guaranteed the military, diplomatic, and financial interest of the Wittelsbach family in the Electorate of Cologne's local affairs. After the deaths of Louis VI, Elector Palatine in 1583 and William the Silent in 1584, the conflict shifted gears again, as the two evenly matched combatants sought outside assistance to break the stalemate. Finally, the intervention of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who had at his command the Spanish Army of Flanders, threw the balance of power in favor of the Catholic side. By 1588, Spanish forces had pushed Gebhard from the Electorate. In 1588 he took refuge in Strassburg, and the remaining Protestant strongholds of the Electorate fell to Parma's forces in 1589.

Trivia question: \\"Who wrote the novel The Virgin and the Gypsy\\"\\"?\\" And the answer is?","completion":"The novel \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" was written by D.H. Lawrence, or David Herbert Lawrence, who is one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. Born on September 11, 1885, in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, England, D.H. Lawrence came from a working-class background and faced numerous hardships growing up. Despite this, his strong intellectual abilities were recognized early on, paving the way for his future career. He obtained a scholarship to Nottingham High School and later studied at Nottingham University. Lawrence is renowned for his exploration of a wide range of thematic concerns in his works, much of which touched upon human sexuality, emotional health, instinct, and nature, among other themes. These were discussed with unprecedented frankness, which was often deemed as controversial. \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" is one such example. Completed around 1922, it was initially unsuccessful in finding a public publisher due to its explicit content. However, it was eventually published posthumously in 1930, following Lawrence's death in 1930. This novella, from a more significant work that was never completed, brings forth some of Lawrence's classic themes. The story centres on Yvette Saywell, a rector's daughter, who is living in the constrained and convention-bound England of the early 20th century. The chance meeting with a gypsy awakens her sexual and emotional self, leading to a powerful narrative of self-discovery and the breaking of traditional conventions. Like many of D.H. Lawrence's works, \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" was groundbreaking in its portrayal of women's sexuality and desire, which was a taboo subject at the time. Through his vivid and naturalistic writing style, Lawrence elucidated the inner struggles and desires of his characters, garnering significant attention and influencing an array of writers that followed. Despite the controversies surrounding his works, Lawrence's unique approach to addressing often untouched themes had made him a seminal literary figure, and his influence can still be felt today. Overall, D.H. Lawrence's literary contribution is remarkable, and his writing, including \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy,\\" continues to intrigue readers and inspire other writers worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: By the CNN Wire Staff updated 5:59 PM EDT, Fri April 20, 2012 (CNN) -- Walgreens will pay governments 7.9 million in a settlement reached amid allegations the drugstore chain illegally paid kickbacks so that prescriptions would be transferred to its pharmacies, the U.S. Justice Department announced Friday. Investigators had been looking into whether Walgreens had given people enrolled in government-run health programs -- such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare (for military families) -- 25 gift cards if they moved their prescriptions over to Walgreens' pharmacies, according to a Justice Department news release. Such inducements violate federal law, the department says. The drugstore chain's advertisements typically noted that such offers didn't apply to those insured via Medicaid, Medicare and similar programs. But the government claimed \\"Walgreens employees frequently ignored the stated exemptions on the face of the coupons and handed gift cards to customers who were beneficiaries of government health programs.\\" The government learned of the allegations in lawsuits filed by two whistle-blowers: Cassie Bass, a pharmacy technician who worked at Walgreens in Detroit, and Jack Chin, an independent pharmacist in Florida. Federal prosecutors from California and Michigan, the U.S. Justice Department's commercial litigation branch, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units and the U.S. Health and Human Service Department's inspector general participated in the joint investigation. Bass and Chin will get about 1.28 million from the United States for their actions under parts of federal and state False Claims Acts statutes, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The federal government will receive just under 7.3 million from Walgreens as part of the settlement, with participating states also receiving some payment from the drugstore chain. \\"This case represents the government's strong commitment to pursuing improper practices in the retail pharmacy industry that have the effect of manipulating patient decisions,\\" said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general with the U.S. Justice Department. On its website, Illinois-based Walgreens describes itself as the nation's largest drugstore chain with sales last fiscal year of 72 billion and 7,847 drugstores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

If I tell you that Actions can be learned through play, and ask you the question \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\", is the correct answer \\"movement\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not necessarily \\"movement\\". While movement is a large part of learning actions in animals, it's not the entire picture. Understanding how an animal learns actions involves understanding a number of factors: Step 1: Animals learn actions through different methods, like operant conditioning (learning from the consequences of individual actions), classical conditioning (associating a voluntary behavior with a new stimulus), and observational learning (watching and imitating other animals). To justify, these learning methods are widely accepted in cognitive science and have been observed in many different animal species, from dogs to dolphins to birds. Step 2: Play is crucial in animal learning process. During play, animals experiment with different movements and actions, learning what works and what doesn't in a safe, low-risk environment. To justify, play is a common behavior in many different animal species, and it's often associated with learning and development. For example, lion cubs play-fight to learn hunting skills, and human children play games to learn social skills. Step 3: Environmental interactions are also a key part of how animals learn actions. Animals learn how to navigate their environment, find food, and avoid predators through interaction with the world around them. To justify, engaging with the environment provides opportunities for animals to explore and test out new behaviors, which contributes to their learning process. So, in conclusion, \\"movement\\" is only a part of how animals learn actions. Other factors such as learning methods, play, and interaction with the environment also play crucial roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It should be in the Black Humour section. It is certainly not scholarship. Answer:","completion":"Based on the customer's review, it is evident that he is dissatisfied with the product. The reviewer has expressed criticism and frustration throughout the review, which suggests a strong negative opinion towards the book. There are several reasons why the reviewer is dissatisfied with the book: 1. The reviewer describes the book as \\"completely unreliable,\\" implying that the information presented in the book is not trustworthy or accurate. 2. The reviewer criticizes the author's ideological stance, stating that the author is part of a group that naively praises the Soviet Union's cultural and political environment. This view may have led to biased or distorted information in the book. 3. The reviewer finds it absurd that this book is still available even after the fall of communism in Europe, suggesting that the ideas in the book are outdated and no longer relevant. 4. Instead of recommending the book, the reviewer explicitly advises potential readers not to \\"touch it with a barge pole.\\" This strong negative suggestion indicates the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product. 5. The reviewer further emphasizes their dissatisfaction by offering an alternative book recommendation, \\"Semyon Volkov's Testimony.\\" By recommending a different book that presumably offers a more accurate representation of Shostakovich's life, the reviewer is trying to steer potential readers away from the book they are reviewing. 6. Lastly, the reviewer mentions that the book should be in the \\"Black Humour\\" section, indicating that the content of the book is so misguided that it could be considered funny or absurd. This further reflects the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the book and questions its credibility as a scholarly work. In conclusion, the reviewer is clearly dissatisfied with the book due to its unreliability, biased perspective, outdated ideas, and lack of scholarly value.

Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\\" Answer:","completion":"Religion and politics significantly shaped the country towards the end of the Republic by becoming more closely intertwined, leading to the influence and consolidation of power within specific individuals, such as Augustus. The intertwining of religious and political offices, particularly through the role of pontifex maximus, allowed for greater authority and influence in governing the nation. Augustus expertly manipulated these religious connections to amass political, military, and priestly powers, which allowed him to implement reforms and control various aspects of Roman society. By presenting these changes as restorative and traditional, he was able to garner support from the public and maintain stability. Furthermore, the maintenance of the pax deorum and the patronage of religious institutions, such as the Vestals, allowed emperors to assert themselves as the moral and spiritual leaders of Rome. This religious authority, combined with political influence, led to the strong establishment of the imperial system, with emperors being expected to continue this pax deorum throughout their reigns. Overall, religion and politics shaped the country by merging power structures, allowing for a more centralized control within emperors and their successors, and facilitating the maintenance of social order and moral values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"First, let's solve the two problems and then we'll determine if they have the same meaning. 1) What is the remainder when 6457^76^57 is divided by 23? Step 1: We need to find a smaller number that is congruent to 6457 modulo 23. We do this by dividing 6457 by 23 and finding the remainder: 6457 ≡ 17 (mod 23) Step 2: Substitute 6457 with 17 and rewrite the expression: 17^(76^57) modulo 23 Step 3: Calculate Euler's totient function (phi) for 23: phi(23) = 22 (since 23 is prime) Step 4: Use Euler's theorem, which states that if gcd(a, n) = 1, then a^phi(n) ≡ 1 (mod n): 17^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23) Step 5: Simplify the exponent (76^57) modulo phi(23) = 22: 76^57 ≡ 1^57 (mod 22) Therefore, 76^57 ≡ 1 (mod 22) Step 6: Substitute the simplified exponent back into the original expression and use Euler's theorem again: 17^(76^57) ≡ 17^1 (mod 23) Therefore, 17^1 ≡ 17 (mod 23) So, the remainder when 6457^76^57 is divided by 23 is 17. 2) What's the remainder when 5^99 is divided by 13? Step 1: Calculate Euler's totient function (phi) for 13: phi(13) = 12 (since 13 is prime) Step 2: Use Euler's theorem, which states that if gcd(a, n) = 1, then a^phi(n) ≡ 1 (mod n): 5^12 ≡ 1 (mod 13) Step 3: Simplify the exponent (99) modulo phi(13) = 12: 99 ≡ 3 (mod 12) Step 4: Substitute the simplified exponent back into the original expression and use Euler's theorem again: 5^99 ≡ 5^3 (mod 13) 5^3 ≡ 125 (mod 13) 125 ≡ 8 (mod 13) So, the remainder when 5^99 is divided by 13 is 8. Now, let's answer the question about the meaning of the problems. Both questions ask for the remainder when a certain number is divided by a given divisor. Both problems involve modular arithmetic and Euler's theorem, which helps in simplifying the calculations. However, the numbers and divisors are different, so the specific calculations and results are not the same. Therefore, the answer is: a). No, the questions do not have the same meaning (even though they share underlying mathematical concepts)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The name \\"Tara\\" itself has its roots in the Old Irish language and is derived from the word \\"Teamhair,\\" which means \\"a lofty place\\" or \\"elevated place.\\" On the other hand, the Chinese naming conventions are profoundly influenced by the Chinese language, culture, and philosophy. Chinese names typically consist of a family name (surname) followed by a given name, and they often hold specific meanings that express parents' wishes or hopes for the child's future. While it might be possible, albeit rare, for someone in China to have the name \\"Tara,\\" it would not be representative of traditional Chinese names. Furthermore, the Chinese writing system consists of characters, each bearing a unique meaning, so a phonetic match with the Irish name may not coincide with a meaningful Chinese name. In conclusion, it is not accurate to say that \\"Tara is a Chinese name\\" just because it has significant cultural relevance in Irish history. Chinese names are derived from a completely separate cultural, linguistic, and historical background, and it would be misleading to impose a connection between the two solely based on the name's importance in Ireland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But local detectives are no closer to finding out who was behind the Aug. 26, 2009, slaying of Heidi Childs and David Metzler at Caldwell Fields in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. Capt. Robert New on Tuesday said the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office still has no new information regarding the double shooting, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Childs, 18, and Metzler, 19, had been together for at least four years and had just started their second year at Virginia Tech, where she was majoring in industrial and systems engineering while he studied biochemistry. Victims: Heidi Childs, 18, and David Metzler, 19, were fatally shot in 2009 in a Virginia campground. The case remains unsolved. A white cross marks the spot where the couple was slain at the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The night they were killed, the couple, both of Virginia, had planned on chatting and playing guitars while parked at the idyllic campground in Montgomery County. Childs told friends they wouldn't be late because she had homework to do. They left her apartment about 8 pm. Next morning, a man walking his dog found their bodies shot by a .30-30 rifle. He was inside his Toyota Camry. She was on the ground outside. Since then, investigators have remained unable to point to a motive, saying the shootings were likely random, according to the Times-Dispatch. On the third anniversary of the homicide in 2012, Sheriff Tommy Whitt revealed that his detectives had found DNA evidence at the scene and were trying to match it to people who frequent the area. He said his department was still actively working the case. Childs and Metzler had been a couple for four years and wanted to attend Virginia Tech together. They were starting their second year there when they were killed. Every year since their killing, friends and family members have continued to drop by to set memorials at the spot where Childs and Metzler died. Back then, Whitt told WSET that he'd called the original lead investigator in the case out of retirement so he would focus finding the killer. Detectives said the shooter took Childs' purse containing her cell phone, camera, Virginia Tech lanyard, ID and credit card. The items are still missing. A 70,000 reward remains in place for any information related to the shootings. Police in 2009 canvas the area in Virginia where the Virginia Tech couple was killed.

Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity. Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?","completion":"To determine whether Company B has tax benefits of debt or not, we need to analyze the situation step by step: Step 1: Understand the concept of tax benefits of debt Tax benefits of debt arise from the fact that interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, which effectively reduces a company's taxable income. This, in turn, reduces the company's tax liability. Step 2: Analyze Company A and Company B's financial structure As stated, Company A is mostly financed by debt, while Company B is mostly financed by equity. This implies that Company A has a higher proportion of debt in its capital structure compared to Company B. Step 3: Evaluate the tax benefits of debt for Company B Since Company B is primarily financed by equity, it is likely to have less debt on its balance sheet. Consequently, the interest expenses and tax-deductible benefits from debt would be lower for Company B as compared to Company A. In conclusion, Company B would have less tax benefits of debt compared to Company A, considering its capital structure is mostly financed by equity.

Read this article and answer this question On 22 August, nearly two months after the main uprisings had been defeated, about 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed in the north-west of the country, at Kilcummin in County Mayo. Joined by up to 5,000 local rebels, they had some initial success, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the British in Castlebar and setting up a short-lived \\"Irish Republic\\" with John Moore as president of one of its provinces, Connacht. This sparked some supportive uprisings in Longford and Westmeath which were quickly defeated, and the main force was defeated at the battle of Ballinamuck, in County Longford, on 8 September 1798. The Irish Republic had only lasted twelve days from its declaration of independence to its collapse. The French troops who surrendered were repatriated to France in exchange for British prisoners of war, but hundreds of the captured Irish rebels were executed. This episode of the 1798 Rebellion became a major event in the heritage and collective memory of the West of Ireland and was commonly known in Irish as Bliain na bhFrancach and in English as \\"The Year of the French\\". On 12 October 1798, a larger French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including Wolfe Tone himself, attempted to land in County Donegal near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a larger Royal Navy squadron, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. Wolfe Tone was tried by court-martial in Dublin and found guilty. He asked for death by firing squad, but when this was refused, Tone cheated the hangman by slitting his own throat in prison on 12 November, and died a week later. How many French soldiers and local rebels in total defeated the British in Castlebar under General Humbert?","completion":"To find the total number of French soldiers and local rebels involved in defeating the British in Castlebar under General Humbert, we need to add the number of French soldiers and the number of local rebels mentioned in the article.

Problem:16/43/1694 Solution:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to determine if a given date in the format \\"mm/dd/yyyy\\" is valid or not. To do this, you need to follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the components of the date: The date is composed of three parts - month (mm), day (dd), and year (yyyy). Each of these components must be individually valid for the date to be considered valid. 2. Analyze the month (mm) for validity: A month is considered valid if it is a number between 1 and 12, since there are 12 months in a year. 3. Analyze the day (dd) for validity: A day is valid if it is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 30 or 31 depending on the month. The months that have 31 days are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. The remaining months have 30 days except for February, which has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year. 4. Analyze the year (yyyy) for validity: A year is always valid if it is expressed in the \\"yyyy\\" format. 5. Determine if the date is valid or not by evaluating the validity of each component: - Check the validity of the month (mm) component. - Check the validity of the day (dd) component considering the month and year (leap or non-leap). - Check the validity of the year (yyyy) component. 6. Return the result: If all three components are valid, return 1 to indicate that the date is valid. Otherwise, return 0 to indicate that the date is invalid. Now, let's apply these steps to the problem: 16/43/1694 1. Identify the components: - Month (mm): 16 - Day (dd): 43 - Year (yyyy): 1694 2. Analyze the month (mm) for validity: The month is 16, which is outside the range of 1 to 12, so the month is invalid. Since the month component is already invalid, there is no need to further analyze the day and year components. Therefore, the date 16/43/1694 is not valid.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals? John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

He is a magician who has a secret trick with his twin brother, and they both perform magic shows while keeping their twin secret. 2) Tesla and Borden's diary: Tesla is another character in the movie. He is a famous inventor who created a special machine, but Borden didn't know about it. Angier, another magician, thought Tesla's machine was the secret behind Borden's trick, so he tried to use it for his own magic. 3) The coincidence: It's true that it's a coincidence Tesla could actually make the machine Angier was looking for, but sometimes, movies have surprises to make the story more exciting. 4) Do those questions have the same meaning? The possible answers are: (A) No, the two questions don't have the same meaning, because one is about Borden and the other is about the connection between Tesla and Borden.

I got this movie so I could make fun of it. I mean, come on, \\"Hood of the Living Dead\\"? What other reaction could I have? The thing is, though, the movie (and its makers) decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of. Instead, it was going to try its best to be a good movie. And you know what? It came awfully close. A little less cheese in the incidental music, a little more professionalism in the photography, the acting, the incidentals (like the props--love the Best Buy bag)...well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own. And the acting, writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than I would have expected. There's even some decent humor, as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints in everything, alas) and the almost constant profanity, this can be a pretty fun time at the movies. No, it ain't great. Yes, it could have been better. But the makers, the actors, the crew, they all tried to make a good film (instead of a camp classic) and that counts for a lot.

The inside is very clean shiny dark wood walls done in a contemporary way. Plenty of large windows to view the city and also a patio with fire pits. The restaurant features more items than just steaks and the menu is accented with French and Asian Accents. Signature Items are recommended. The Tuna Tartare (a signature item) might have been the best Tuna Tartare I ever had. Unless Tuna is really good I don't enjoy it raw but this was truly delicious. The fish was sweet and fresh and the textures of the Avocado were just right. The Ginger Marinade made it pop with the just right flavors. The Black Truffle Cheese Fritters are very additive. They were only marble sized put packed a delicious mouthful. I could have eaten them all by myself. They had this very thin shell that tasted kind of like a yummy potato chip and the inside tasted like it was filled with like an Italian seasoned parmesan cream taste with truffles to me. It was a bomb of delicious flavors. I had the Fresh just flown in that day sautu00e9ed Grouper with Spaghetti Squash. The Fish had a tasty nice seasoned crust and was flaky and moist inside. it sat in a sesame miso broth dotted with chili oil that didn't over power the fish. The spaghetti squash just soaked up the sauce. My husband had the 19oz. Rib Eye with a side order of the Brussels Sprouts and the Black Pepper condiment. The steak was prepared MR as he requested. I tasted a small piece and it seemed on par with other steak houses but the Black Pepper Condiment was really Outstanding. I could tell a lot of work went into it. The sauce tasted like combination of reduced beef confit onions with black pepper to me. It takes all day to make that kind of sauce. I love brussels sprouts and pecans and aged balsamic but they didn't have that yum factor to me or to my husband. They weren't bad just OK. We decided to try the Apple Crumble for dessert. It was as tasty as an apple crumble can be with a refreshing big hit of cinnamon and the creamy cinnamon ice cream went just right with it. It delicious but more homestyle than I was expecting.

First, we need to find the sum of -490, -420, and 244. -490 is like losing 490 candies. -420 means losing 420 more candies (so sad). Then, we get 244 candies back (yay!). Now let's see how many candies we end up with: Losing 490 candies and losing 420 more gives us: -490 - 420 = -910 (we are still in negative, so we lost 910 candies) Now, we get 244 candies back: -910 + 244 = -666 (we still have a loss and need 666 candies more to even things out) Now the equation looks like this: -666 = 74*c To find the value of 'c', we need to divide -666 by 74 (like sharing -666 candies into 74 groups). -666 ÷ 74 = -9 (each group will have -9 candies, or each group needs 9 candies to even things out) So, c = -9, and that's the answer!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amos and Jim were early astir on Monday morning, the fifth of March, but before noon came both were convinced that the threatened trouble would blow over without the slightest semblance of a conflict between the soldiers and the citizens. During the forenoon they had not so much as heard of Hardy Baker, or that faction to which he had allied himself, and Jim said, with a quiet chuckle of satisfaction: \\"I reckon the barber got as much of a lesson as he needed Saturday afternoon, and has given over trying to set right the wrongs of the people.\\" \\"He must be at work, or we should have heard something regarding him,\\" Amos replied, and then ceased even to think of the apprentice. Shortly after noon those assembled under the Liberty Tree,--and there were quite as many as had gathered on Friday and Saturday,--were told that the Council had discussed with Governor Hutchinson the question of removing the troops from the city, and assured him the people would be satisfied with nothing else. It was also said the Governor had refused to do anything regarding the matter; but that Samuel Adams had publicly declared the troops should be sent away, and that without loss of time. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, Amos and Jim heard once more from Master Piemont's assistant. It was told under the Liberty Tree that he had been seen in company with Attucks, the mulatto, and half a dozen others, near Wentworth's Wharf, and that Hardy had distinguished himself by taunting with cowardice, a squad of soldiers, until the redcoats avenged the insults with blows; but nothing more serious than a street brawl was the result. 1.

Goat suddenly revives, and then kills himself by slamming his head against a glass window.The squad tracks a third creature down into the dig site, where it kills three more marines. Sam and Reaper try to convince Sarge that the creatures are humans from the facility, mutated by the addition of a Martian chromosome (called C24) they found and synthesized from the bones discovered, and that not all of those infected will fully transform into creatures. Regardless, Sarge orders his team to sanitize the entire facility. Sarge kills the creature in the medical lab (revealed to be a mutated Dr. Carmack) and executes one of his marines for defying his commands. Sam and the surviving marines are then flanked by the infected, partly mutated, humans. Only Sam and a wounded Reaper escape.

In leaving, they also shoot the little dog of fourteen-year-old Megan Wheeler. As Megan buries her dog in the woods and prays for a miracle, a stranger passes by heading to the town on horseback. Megan's mother, Sarah, is being courted by Hull Barret, the leader of the miners. Hull heads to town to pick up supplies, where some of the same thugs begin to beat him up and he is rescued by the stranger, who takes the three men on single-handedly. Hull invites him to dinner at his house, and while the stranger is washing, Hull notices what looks like six bullet wounds to his back. Shortly after, he appears wearing a clerical collar and thereafter is called \\"Preacher\\". Coy LaHood's son Josh attempts to scare Preacher with a show of strength from his giant work hand, Club, who with one hammer blow smashes a large rock that Preacher and Hull had been laboring over. When Club attempts to attack Preacher, he hits him in the face with his hammer and delivers a blow to Club's groin. Coy LaHood has been away in Sacramento and is furious to learn about Preacherâs arrival through his son, since this will stiffen the resistance of the tin-panners. Having failed to bribe him to settle in the town instead, LaHood offers to buy the miners out, initially for 100, then 125 and then the Preacher goads him into raising his offer to 1,000 per claim, but only if they leave within 24 hours; otherwise LaHood threatens to hire a corrupt Marshal named Stockburn to clear them out. The miners initially want to accept the offer but, when Hull reminds them why they came and what they have sacrificed, they decide to stay and fight.

Select from: -No. -Yes. The answer is:","completion":"No. A more reasonable answer would be as follows: Abraham Lincoln, born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky, was the 16th President of the United States. He served from March 4, 1861, until his assassination on April 15, 1865. Having grown up in a humble background, Lincoln became a self-taught lawyer before entering politics. He represented the Whig party in the Illinois state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives before joining the newly-formed Republican party and ultimately becoming its first successful candidate for the presidency. Lincoln's tenure was marked by the bitter Civil War between the Union (Northern states) and the Confederacy (Southern states), which had seceded from the Union over the issue of slavery. Through his strong leadership and perseverance, Lincoln played a significant role in preserving the Union and eventually ended slavery in the United States by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared all enslaved people in the Confederate states to be set free, and later supported the passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery throughout the country. Just five days after the Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant, signifying the end of the Civil War, President Lincoln was assassinated. He was shot at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, and succumbed to his injuries the following day. Lincoln is remembered for his dedication to preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, and as a symbol of American values and democracy. As for the statement, \\"There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president,\\" it is indeed a factually correct assertion about the number of people who have served as U.S. president and the unique counting of Grover Cleveland.

She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\".

He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R.

The album sold 3 million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records. Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million, which sold 3 million copies in the United States and more than 8 million copies worldwide.

A:","completion":"To answer the question of which is older, the pyramid or Stonehenge, we need to compare the estimated dates for their construction. Step 1: Determine the date range for the construction of the pyramids The most famous Egyptian pyramids, the Pyramids of Giza, were built during the 26th century BC. However, the oldest known pyramid is the Step Pyramid of Djoser, which was constructed during the 27th century BC. Step 2: Determine the date range for the construction of Stonehenge Archaeologists believe that Stonehenge was built in phases between 3000 BC and 2000 BC. Step 3: Compare the dates The Step Pyramid of Djoser (27th century BC) is older than the Pyramids of Giza (26th century BC) and also older than the earliest estimated construction date for Stonehenge (3000 BC). In conclusion, the pyramid (specifically, the Step Pyramid of Djoser) is older than Stonehenge. Regarding your suggested answer: \\"Archaeologists believe it was built anywhere from 3000 BC to 2000 BC,\\" it is a reasonable answer if the context is Stonehenge's construction date.

Homeowners who fitted solar panels will soon be left out of pocket according to a leaked document which reveals the government is planning to slash the amount of money it pays for generating renewable energy. In an embarrassing slip-up, the Energy Savings Trust charity accidentally published confidential details of proposals to cut renewable energy payments by more than 50 per cent. It would mean the amount the average household receives for generating solar energy would fall from £1,190 to £640. Cuts: Homeowners with solar roof panels will see the amount of money they are paid by the government slashed by 50 per cent according to a leaked document. Government energy ministers are expected to announce the cuts in Parliament on Monday. Earlier. week Climate Change minister Greg Barker said he believed that tariffs. paid by government needed to reflect the falling cost of solar. technology. Climate change minister Greg barker said tariffs need to reflect the falling cost of solar technology. According to the leaked document the new. tariffs could be brought in as early as December 8 and would see. payments fall from the current 43.3p per kilowatt hour to just 21p for surplus electricity fed back into the national grid. The. Energy Savings Trust quickly withdrew the document but not before the. news had spread causing widespread concern amongst homeowners and. companies which install solar panels. A. spokesman for the charity said: 'We’ve been working on a draft consumer. guidance document in relation to the Fast Track Review of Feed in. Tariffs for Solar PV to pre-empt the Government consultation which is. expected next week. 'Preparing. advice on a potential announcement was the responsible thing to do as. the leading consumer advice body in this area. Unfortunately, due to a. technical error this document was made available for search.' Industry. experts believe that if the new tariffs are introduced it could put. dozens of firms out of business and cost as many as 25,000 jobs. They also point out it will effectively discourage people from adopting solar and other renewable energy technologies. Homeowners. with cash to spare can pay for solar equipment themselves and receive. up to £1,000 a year from the government subsidy and electricity savings. Those. unable to cover the cost of the equipment upfront can sign up with. solar technology firms and effectively rent out their rooftops so the. companies pay for the panels and the benefits are split. Solar. businesses are now calling on energy ministers to reconsider Monday's. scheduled announcement, in which they are expected to confirm the leak. Slip up: The document was leaked after a 'technical error' on the Energy Savings Trust website. Shaun Taylor, managing director of Buckinghamshire-based SolarTech, posted on the ClickGreen website: 'If this leak proves accurate then the Government will be condemning tens of thousands of residents in social housing to continued fuel poverty as there is no way that 'free PV' schemes will now be financially viable. 'The impact on employment will also be enormous as the industry had forecast 20,000 to 30,000 jobs would be created in this sector. 'If the Government's plan was to add to unemployment, close businesses, leave thousands in fuel poverty and miss our European Carbon Reduction Targets then job done! Let’s hope that this leak doesn’t turn out to be accurate and drown the industry.'

The paragraph only provides information about the actions taken by public health officials in the Dominican Republic and Haiti to control the outbreak of polio cases and that the situation is now under control, and the disease is not a public health threat in these countries. In order to make a comparison between the polio cases in the American health care system and the Dominican Republic, we would need more data and context. It is worth noting that polio has been eliminated in the United States, and the country has been polio-free since 1979 thanks to the widespread use of polio vaccines.

Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining the constant terms The constant terms are -4101 and 8726 in the equation.

It points out that these entities could have different or even competing goals, adding to the complexity of the task for federal agencies. Turning to the hypothesis, it essentially repeats the central theme expressed in the premise, albeit in a slightly condensed form. It focuses on expressing the idea of federal agencies encountering a challenging task of balancing the needs of customers, service providers, and other stakeholders, but without mentioning the complications arising from these parties possibly having differing or competing goals. Thus, if the premise is valid, the hypothesis stands to reason as well since it is contained within the premise. It doesn't contradict or expand upon the premise, but simplifies it, keeping the core idea intact. In conclusion, the hypothesis is a distilled version of the premise. Therefore, if the premise is accepted as true, the hypothesis, being a subset of that premise, should also be regarded as true. However, it should be noted that although the hypothesis is true, it does not provide the same level of detail or insight as the premise, particularly concerning the conflict of interest that could appear among different parties.

The 19-year-old forward could end up costing £58m with various add-ons. Speaking at a private function for United's executive ticket holders on Wednesday, Van Gaal said Martial would be of more use to the man who takes over when the Dutchman's contract expires in 2017. \\"He is for the next manager,\\" said the 64-year-old. Van Gaal believes that man will be his current assistant and former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs. Speaking to an invited audience of about 1,000 for 40 minutes at Lancashire's Old Trafford cricket ground, Van Gaal said he \\"feels\\" Giggs will be his successor. Although Van Gaal has previously backed Giggs as a future United boss, the club's hierarchy have not confirmed that is their intention. Giggs joined Van Gaal on stage at one point to answer pre-submitted questions. The Dutchman praised United's supporters for sticking with him last season when results, especially in the early weeks of his tenure, were poor. He also said Wayne Rooney, England's new top goalscorer, was one of the best captains he had ever worked with and that he now looked at Sir Bobby Charlton, whose record his captain has just taken, with greater affection having become more aware of his career achievements. Asked about France international Martial, Van Gaal said: \\"The fee is ridiculous.\\" Martial had completed just four 90-minute appearances prior to the start of the season, and Van Gaal added: \\"The problem is when Manchester United try to sign a player, it costs £10m more. When we are selling one, the clubs always want to get them for less.\\" There were no questions on the future of goalkeeper David De Gea, whose agent Jorge Mendes was at United's training ground on Thursday. The 24-year-old saw a move to Real Madrid collapse on transfer deadline day and is expected to be back in the squad to face Liverpool on Saturday (17.30 BST kick-off). United are reported to be considering offering the Spaniard, twice the club's player's player of the year, a new contract with a release clause. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that a delegation of senior players spoke to Van Gaal several weeks ago about his rigid approach and training ground methods. The Dutchman surprised his players by making them train before they could go home upon their arrival back in Manchester from the club's pre-season tour of the United States.

For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition. - Finca Vigía (\\"Lookout Farm\\") was the home of Ernest Hemingway in San Francisco de Paula Ward in Havana, Cuba. Now like his Key West property, Finca Vigía is now a museum. - Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \\"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\\" (original Swedish: \\"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \\"work\\" refers to an author's work as a whole.

His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.

Peter Jackson, currently one of the world's most well-known directors and the unofficial face of the entire nation of New Zealand, was born on October 31, 1961 in Pukerua Bay, New Zealand. He liked to take photographs, so a family friend bought the young Jackson a super 8mm camera. He has been a filmmaker even since. At age nine he even attempted to remake his favorite film, King Kong, using his own stop-motion effect. Unlike many of the filmmakers working today, Jackson never went to film school. Instead he created his own short films with the help of family and friends. He was turned down for a job at the National Film Unit, New Zealand's government agency that produces tourist films about the country. With that avenue closed, Jackson began working other jobs to support himself, while shooting shorts on the weekend. One of these weekend films, expanded from its original ten minutes length into a feature film. The project took four years to complete (1983-1987)and was called Bad Taste. After the success of Bad Taste, Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is obviously a huge landmark in Jackson's career, not only did the films become some of the most commercially successful of all time, _ His digital effects company, WETA Digital, became one of, if not the most respected effects company in the world; similarly, Jackson has also expressed an interest in returning to his roots and directing some lower-budget splatter films again.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...

Write an article with the title: \\"What gun control advocates don’t understand about gun owners\\"","completion":"Title: What Gun Control Advocates Don't Understand About Gun Owners Hello, little friends! Today, let's learn about something that grown-ups talk about a lot: gun control and gun owners. You know what a gun is, right? It's a tool that some people use for self-defense, hunting, or sports, like those water guns you play with, but much more powerful and dangerous. Some people want more rules about who can have guns and how they can use them. These people are called gun control advocates. But sometimes, they don't understand why other people, or gun owners, want to keep their guns. Let's talk about a few things they might not understand. 1. People have different reasons for owning guns You know how sometimes you have favorite toys for different reasons? Gun owners have favorites, too! They might use a gun to protect their family, or for hunting to get food, or even just for fun, like going to a shooting range with friends. Everyone has their reasons, and it's important to remember that not all gun owners are bad or dangerous people. 2. Gun owners care about safety, too When you across the street, you always look both ways so you don't get hurt, right? Well, gun owners also care about being safe! They often learn how to handle a gun safely and keep it away from children. Many gun owners even teach their kids about gun safety, just like how parents teach you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. 3. Owning a gun is a right in some places In a big place called the United States of America, owning a gun is like having the right to go to school or owning a pet. This right comes from their important rulebook, called the Constitution. So, when people talk about taking away guns, gun owners might feel like someone is trying to take away one of their rights. 4. Gun owners believe in \\"good guy with a gun\\" You know how in fairy tales, there's always a good guy to save the day? Many gun owners think they can be that good guy! They believe that if a bad person tries to hurt someone, a good person with a gun could stop them and keep everyone safe. That's another reason why they want to keep their guns. 5. Not all guns are the same You know that your small toy car and a real car are different, right? Just like with cars, there are many types of guns. Some guns are small, and some are big. Some are really powerful, and some are mostly for fun. It's important to remember that not all guns are the same. In conclusion, it's important to learn and understand why people have different opinions about guns. Remember, always look both ways when crossing the street, and if you ever see a real gun, tell an adult right away. Keep learning, little friends!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The backlash started when Lovitz made comments criticizing the President's claim that the rich do not pay their taxes, stating that the idea is \\"fucking bullshit.\\" In his appearance on the show, Lovitz further explained his thoughts on the matter, debunking the notion that there exists a conflict between the 1% and the 99% of the population. He stated, according to Politico and Mediaite, “There’s nobody that’s wealthy saying, ‘Let’s go get the people that aren’t.’ … He’s creating a false class warfare.” Lovitz argued that the idea of the rich not paying their fair share is incorrect and misleading. During the conversation, Lovitz went into quite a lengthy explanation of why he believes the rich do pay their fair share, citing various taxes and deductions he faces. “Don’t tell me I’m not paying my fair share when, between federal, state, property tax, FICA, and everything, I’m paying at least 50%,” he said. As for Wall Street's involvement in the housing crisis, the comedian acknowledged that some blame does lie there. However, he also pointed out that individual responsibility cannot be ignored. \\"Some people they got housing loans, I think they’re responsible for taking a loan they didn’t qualify for,\\" he added. Lovitz's outspoken stance against the President's rhetoric on class divides highlights the ongoing debate over taxation and wealth disparities in the United States. While there may be no consensus reached, Lovitz's comments have certainly sparked a conversation about the role of the rich and the perception of fairness when it comes to paying taxes in America."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick from: I. no. II. yes.","completion":"Babybel is a brand of cheese that originated in France. It is popular for its small, individually packaged servings wrapped in red wax. The original Babybel cheese is primarily a type of Edam cheese, which is a Dutch semisoft cheese. However, Babybel has expanded their product line to include different types of cheeses, such as Cheddar, Gouda, and Mozzarella among others. There are numerous varieties of cheese available, each with their unique characteristics. Some of the most popular types of cheese and their special features include: 1. Cheddar: Originating from the village of Cheddar in England, this cheese is one of the most popular choices globally. Cheddar can range from mild to extra sharp, depending on the length of aging. It is perfect for melting, making it a common addition to sandwiches, burgers, and casseroles. 2. Mozzarella: Hailing from Southern Italy, mozzarella is a soft, white cheese traditionally made from the milk of the water buffalo. It is now also commonly made from cow's milk. Mozzarella is famously used in pizza, Caprese salad, and various pasta dishes due to its mild flavor and excellent melting properties. 3. Brie: This is a soft, creamy, and buttery cheese that originated in France. Brie is usually characterized by its white or pale yellow color and bloomy, edible rind. It has a mild, earthy flavor that pairs well with fruits, nuts, and crusty bread. 4. Gouda: Gouda is a Dutch cheese with a smooth, creamy texture and mild, nutty flavor. It is available in various stages of maturity, with the aged Gouda being harder and denser, possessing a more robust, caramel-like flavor. 5. Roquefort: A blue cheese that originated from the south of France, Roquefort features distinctive blue veins created by the fungus Penicillium Roqueforti. This cheese has a strong, tangy flavor and is often crumbled over salads or enjoyed with fruits and nuts. 6. Gruyère: A type of Swiss cheese, Gruyère is characterized by its pale yellow color and smooth texture with small holes. It is an excellent melting cheese and contains a sweet yet slightly salty flavor, making it ideal for fondue, quiches, and other baked dishes. 7. Feta: Originating in Greece, this crumbly white cheese is made from sheep's milk, goat's milk, or a mixture of the two. Feta has a tangy, salty flavor and is often used in Greek salads, spanakopita, and other Mediterranean dishes. 8. Camembert: Similar to Brie, Camembert is a soft-ripened cheese that originated in France. It has an earthy, almost mushroom-like flavor and a creamy, velvety texture. Usually served at room temperature, Camembert goes well with bread, crackers, and fruits. 9. Parmesan: A hard, granular cheese that originated in Italy, Parmesan, specifically Parmigiano-Reggiano, is aged for 12 months or more and boasts a nutty, umami-rich flavor. It is often grated on pasta, risotto, and salads or enjoyed in chunks with fruits and nuts. 10. Stilton: This English blue cheese is crumbly in texture and has a sharp, pungent flavor.

Question: Question: \\"What factor might influence why earlywood is lighter in color than latewood?\\" Context: \\"If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood. However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The primary factor that influences earlywood being lighter in color than latewood is related to the differences in cell structure and growth rate during the growing season. During the beginning of the growing season, tree growth is rapid due to favorable environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and nutrient availability. This rapid growth results in the formation of larger, wider cells with thinner cell walls in the earlywood or springwood. These cells have a higher proportion of parenchyma cells and thin-walled tracheids compared to latewood. Parenchyma cells are living cells that are involved in metabolism and storage, whereas tracheids are dead cells at maturity that are involved in water transport. The higher proportion of living cells in earlywood contributes to its lighter coloration. As the growing season progresses and environmental conditions become less favorable, the growth rate slows down, which results in the formation of latewood or summerwood. Latewood is characterized by smaller, more densely packed cells with thicker cell walls. It is composed of a higher proportion of lignified cells and thick-walled tracheids, making it darker and denser than earlywood. The increased amount of lignin, a complex organic polymer that strengthens and stiffens cell walls, contributes to the darker coloration of latewood. In summary, the factors that influence earlywood being lighter in color than latewood include differences in cell structure, growth rate, and the relative proportions of living cells, lignified cells, and tracheids formed during the growing season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Craig Hope Follow @@CraigHope01 Newcastle United have completed the signing of Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere for a fee in the region of £6million. The 24-year-old put the finishing touches to his move at the Magpies’ North Tyneside training base on Wednesday. But despite being Monaco's top marksman last term, very little is known of Riviere. Here, Sportsmail tells you more... VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Riviere joins Newcastle United Another one! Newcastle have added to their French contingent with the signing of Emmanuel Riviere Well then, who is he? Riviere is a 24-year-old striker – born on the French-ruled Caribbean island of Martinique - who has played for France at every level up to and including under-21, where he scored six times from 15 appearances. The first thing to mention is his blistering pace and a lot of","completion":"his success as a forward comes from his ability to outrun defenders with ease. Riviere is known for his ability to find pockets of space, latch onto through balls, and beat his man to get into goal-scoring positions. He is often compared to former French international Thierry Henry due to his playstyle and speed. Riviere began his professional career with AS Saint-Etienne, where he scored 10 goals in 52 appearances before moving on to Toulouse FC. There, he netted 22 times in 95 appearances, which earned him a move to the big-spending AS Monaco. At Monaco, Riviere played alongside the likes of Falcao and James Rodriguez, where he managed to score 17 goals in 50 appearances, despite having to compete for a spot in a star-studded attack. Last season, he emerged as Monaco's top goal scorer, catching the eye of several European clubs, including Newcastle United. Newcastle, having lost Loic Remy and potentially target man Papiss Cisse, were in desperate need of a striker to bolster their attacking options for the upcoming season. Riviere fits the bill perfectly for the Magpies, especially given their inclination to sign talented French players in recent years. Manager Alan Pardew will hope that Riviere's pace and goal-scoring prowess will add an extra dimension to Newcastle's attack. He will likely partner up with recent signing Siem de Jong, creating an exciting and potentially lethal strike partnership up front for the Magpies. However, it remains to be seen whether Riviere can adapt to the physicality and intensity of the English Premier League. Fans will be keen to see if the 24-year-old can replicate his Ligue 1 success on Tyneside and fire Newcastle up the table. Newcastle United supporters should be excited about Riviere's arrival, as it demonstrates the club's ambition and commitment to strengthen the squad in key areas. Riviere's arrival, coupled with the signing of Siem de Jong, Remy Cabella, and Daryl Janmaat, has signaled a new era for the Magpies, with owner Mike Ashley seemingly more willing to invest in the team after years of frugal spending. In conclusion, Emmanuel Riviere's signing represents a promising addition to Newcastle United's attacking arsenal, and fans should be eager to see him don the iconic black and white stripes in the upcoming season. With his electric pace and eye for goal, Newcastle supporters will be hoping Riviere can make a significant impact and help propel their team towards a successful Premier League campaign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This would result in lower oxygen levels in the bloodstream, which can lead to various health issues such as hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in body tissues) and consequently affect cellular respiration as well as organ function. The perturbation would also have indirect effects on other body systems that rely on sufficient oxygen levels to function properly.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Alexandros Othonaios ( Greek : , Gytheio , 1879 - Athens , 20 September 1970 ) was a distinguished Greek general , who became briefly Prime Minister of Greece , heading an emergency government during an abortive coup in 1933 . - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - The Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic (\\"Prothypourgós tis Ellinikís Dimokratías\\"), colloquially referred to as the Prime Minister of Greece (\\"Prothypourgós tis Elládas\\"), is the head of government of the Hellenic Republic and the leader of the Greek cabinet. The incumbent prime minister is Alexis Tsipras, who took office on 21 September 2015. - Alexis Tsipras (; born 28 July 1974) is the 185th and current Prime Minister of Greece, having been sworn in on 21 September 2015. He previously served as the 183rd Prime Minister of Greece from 26 January 2015 to 27 August 2015. Tsipras has been leader of the left-wing Greek political party Syriza since 4 October 2009. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - East Mani (- \\"Anatolikí Máni\\") is a municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Its seat of administration is the town Gytheio (before 2011 the small town Kotronas). The municipality is located in the eastern part of the Mani Peninsula. It is a mountainous and rocky area. Its economy relies on fishing, olive oil and tourism. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - Gytheio, the ancient Gythium or Gytheion, is a town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km. It was the seaport of Sparta, some north. Gytheio used to be an important port until it was destroyed in 4th century AD, possibly by an earthquake. Today it is the largest and most important town in Mani. It is also the seat of the municipality of East Mani. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

Please answer the following question: All life relies on a relatively narrow range of pH, or acidity, and acids have low pH's. Given these facts, all life relies on a relatively narrow range of what among the following options: - voltage - Energy - sun's heat - low pHs - Decibels - spectrum - Light - sunlight Answer:","completion":"All life relies on a relatively narrow range of low pHs. To understand why this is the case, we must first understand the concept of pH and its significance in living systems. The pH scale is a measure of the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution and ranges from 0 to 14. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is considered acidic, while a solution with a pH greater than 7 is considered basic. Pure water has a pH of 7 and is considered neutral. Acids are substances that can donate protons (H+ ions) in an aqueous solution, and their presence lowers the pH of a solution. Low pH environments can be harmful to living organisms, as high concentrations of H+ ions can disrupt the intricate balance of biochemical reactions occurring within cells, and even denature proteins and cellular components. The optimal pH range for most organisms is between 6.5 and 8.0, although some extremophiles, such as certain types of bacteria and archaea, can tolerate and even thrive in more extreme pH conditions. The importance of maintaining a stable pH level cannot be overstated. Various metabolic processes, enzymatic reactions, and cellular structures depend on maintaining a specific pH or pH range. This delicate balancing act is crucial for cellular health and functionality. For example, the human body maintains blood pH within a narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, and deviations from this range can result in a life-threatening condition called acidosis or alkalosis. The narrow range of pH that most life on Earth relies on is not directly related to the other options provided, which are voltage, energy, sun's heat, decibels, spectrum, light, and sunlight. These parameters may be important for various aspects of life, such as energy production, photosynthesis, and communication, but they do not directly correlate with maintaining an optimal pH range required for cellular function and overall survival of an organism. In summary, all life relies on a relatively narrow range of low pHs to ensure the stable and efficient functioning of cellular processes, enzymatic activities, and structural integrity of proteins and cellular components. This delicate balance is vital for the survival of all living organisms on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established in 1915, following the discovery of opals . The town is sometimes called the \\"opal capital of the world,\\" because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style of underground living. While the structures may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?

On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland.

Write a summary based on this article: Image caption Humans and animals could not evolve in a co-operative environment by being selfish, scientists say Evolution does not favour selfish people, according to new research. This challenges a previous theory which suggested it was preferable to put yourself first. Instead, it pays to be co-operative, shown in a model of \\"the prisoner's dilemma\\", a scenario of game theory - the study of strategic decision-making. Published in Nature Communications, the team says their work shows that exhibiting only selfish traits would have made us become extinct. Game theory involves devising \\"games\\" to simulate situations of conflict or co-operation. It allows researchers to unravel complex decision-making strategies and to establish why certain types of behaviour among individuals emerge. It's almost like what we had in the cold war, an arms race - but these arms races occur all the time in evolutionary biology Dr Christoph Adami , Michigan State University Freedom or prison A team from Michigan State University, US, used a model of the prisoner's dilemma game, where two suspects who are interrogated in separate prison cells must decide whether or not to inform on each other. In the model, each person is offered a deal for freedom if they inform on the other, putting their opponent in jail for six months. However, this scenario will only be played out if the opponent chooses not to inform. If both \\"prisoners\\" choose to inform (defection) they will both get three months in prison, but if they both stay silent (co-operation) they will both only get a jail term of one month. The eminent mathematician John Nash showed that the optimum strategy was not to co-operate in the prisoner's dilemma game. Image caption Co-operating is key for evolution \\"For many years, people have asked that if he [Nash] is right, then why do we see co-operation in the animal kingdom, in the microbial world and in humans,\\" said lead author Christoph Adami of Michigan State University. Mean extinction The answer, he explained, was that communication was not previously taken into account. The selfish gene? In 1974, Richard Dawkins published a gene-centred view of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. He argued that it was not groups or organisms that adapt and evolve, but individual genes and each living organism's body was a survival machine for its genes. Prof Andrew Coleman from Leicester University explains that this new work suggests that co-operation helps a group evolve, but does not argue against the selfish gene theory of evolution. Rather, he adds, it helps selfish genes survive as they reap the awards of inhabiting co-operative groups. Is DNA the smartest molecule in existence? \\"The two prisoners that are interrogated are not allowed to talk to each other. If they did they would make a pact and be free within a month. But if they were not talking to each other, the temptation would be to rat the other out. \\"Being mean can give you an advantage on a short timescale but certainly not in the long run - you would go extinct.\\" These latest findings contradict a 2012 study where it was found that selfish people could get ahead of more co-operative partners, which would create a world full of selfish beings. This was dubbed a \\"mean and selfish\\" strategy and depended on a participant knowing their opponent's previous decision and adapting their strategy accordingly. Crucially, in an evolutionary environment, knowing your opponent's decision would not be advantageous for long because your opponent would evolve the same recognition mechanism to also know you, Dr Adami explained. This is exactly what his team found, that any advantage from defecting was short-lived. They used a powerful computer model to run hundreds of thousands of games, simulating a simple exchange of actions that took previous communication into account. Image caption A previous study found that selfish strategies were favourable \\"What we modelled in the computer were very general things, namely decisions between two different behaviours. We call them co-operation and defection. But in the animal world there are all kinds of behaviours that are binary, for example to flee or to fight,\\" Dr Adami told BBC News. \\"It's almost like what we had in the cold war, an arms race - but these arms races occur all the time in evolutionary biology.\\" Social insects Prof Andrew Coleman of Leicester University, UK, said this new work \\"put a brake on over-zealous interpretations\\" of the previous strategy, which proposed that manipulative, selfish strategies would evolve. \\"Darwin himself was puzzled about the co-operation you observe in nature. He was particularly struck by social insects,\\" he explained. \\"You might think that natural selection should favour individuals that are exploitative and selfish, but in fact we now know after decades of research that this is an oversimplified view of things, particularly if you take into account the selfish gene feature of evolution. \\"It's not individuals that have to survive, its genes, and genes just use individual organisms - animals or humans - as vehicles to propagate themselves.\\" \\"Selfish genes\\" therefore benefit from having co-operative organisms. ||||| Everyone likes a brain-teaser, so let’s try one: You and your friend get busted for illegally downloading \\"Grown Ups 2\\" on your PC. The authorities lock you up, equally offended by your disregard for the law as by your taste for Kevin James sequels. But they’re willing to cut a deal with you, on the condition that you throw your friend under the bus as follows: If you rat out your friend and testify against him, you walk free and your friend goes to prison for a year, assuming he stays silent. If you both testify against each other, you both go to prison for six months. However, if you both remain silent, you’re both out of prison in one month. What do you do? This scenario is the prisoner’s dilemma, a staple of a field called game theory which tries to figure out why cooperative behavior exists and how individuals make decisions based on reason and self-interest. According to classic game theory, a rational person in the scenario above would turn in his friend because it’s a cautious approach that ensures he won’t wind up in the worst-case scenario (staying silent while the friend sings, resulting in a one-year prison sentence). Everyone’s favorite \\"Beautiful Mind,\\" John Nash, figured this out and got a Nobel Prize for it. “But if that’s the rational behavior, why do we see cooperation in the real world?” asked Chris Adami, a computational biologist at Michigan State University. The catch, Adami pointed out, is that in Nash’s prisoner’s dilemma, the prisoners aren’t allowed to talk to each other. But if you introduce the possibility of communication, you can understand why the prisoners may act differently, making a deal to both remain silent and allowing cooperative behavior to evolve. Despite the plausibility for cooperation to evolve, physicists William Press and Freeman Dyson recently came up with a model to show how selfish behavior should still dominate in nature. Adami and his Michigan State colleague Arend Hintze set out to test the model by conducting a series of mathematical simulation games from the comfort of their own computers. (You don’t need to go to the Galapagos to study evolution!) In their study, released Thursday in Nature Communications, they created theoretical populations of organisms in which some were selfish and some were “suckers,” as Adami put it. If the two personality types were unable to tell each other apart, the selfish individuals would attack one another and the suckers and eventually go extinct, and the suckers would win. However, if the selfish ones could recognize the suckers but not vice versa, then the selfish ones would win, playing nice with one another while killing off the suckers. If each population could recognize the other, then the ultimate outcome would depend on the population size. For example, if the suckers had a numbers advantage, they could cooperate to overcome the selfish ones, allowing the cooperative behavior to quickly spread across the population and drive the selfish types to extinction. It wouldn’t pay to be a jerk. So how does this all relate to the real world? It’s not as simple as labeling everyone as “selfish” or “sucker” and predicting what will happen, but such models give us a simple way to understand how behaviors like cooperation and selfishness do -- or do not -- evolve. And there are opportunities to make the models more complex to better reflect the complexity of human behavior, Adami said. Extending beyond humans, many animals demonstrate cooperative behavior, but being able to model that behavior and understand how it came about depends on recognizing how the animals communicate with one another, Adami said. Maybe it is time to go to the Galapagos after all. Return to Science Now. brad.balukjian@latimes.com Follow on Twitter: @BradBalukjian ||||| EAST LANSING — Nice guys finish last, according to conventional precept. But new research from Michigan State University says otherwise. \\"We found evolution will punish you if you’re selfish and mean,” said Christoph Adami, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at MSU, and one of two evolutionary biologists involved in a recent study. Adami co-authored a scientific paper with MSU molecular and microbiology research associate Arend Hintze focusing on game theory, a study of strategic decision making used in biology, economics, political science and other disciplines. The pair challenged findings in a 2012 research paper that concluded a new strategy called zero-determinant guaranteed selfish players victory over cooperative players. “The paper caused quite a stir,” Adami said. “The main result appeared to be completely new, despite 30 years of intense research in this area.” Adami and Hintze used computers to run hundreds of thousands of game-theory simulations, ultimately finding that zero-determinant strategies can never be the product of evolution. Their studies showed that while the zero-determinant strategy is advantageous to those who employ it, the strategy doesn't work well against opponents practicing the same tactics. “In an evolutionary setting, with populations of strategies, you need extra information to distinguish each other,” Adami said. In their study, Adami and Hintze found that zero-determinant strategies only succeeded if players knew who their opponents were and adapted their strategies accordingly: A zero-determinant player would play one way against another zero-determinant player but play a different way against a cooperative player. “The only way ZD strategists could survive would be if they could recognize their opponents,” Hintze said. “And even if ZD strategists kept winning so that only ZD strategists were left, in the long run they would have to evolve away from being ZD and become more cooperative. So they wouldn’t be ZD strategists anymore.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"New research conducted by a team from Michigan State University contradicts previous studies suggesting that evolution favors selfishness. The team leveraged a model of the \\"prisoner's dilemma,\\" a game theory scenario used to explore strategic decision-making, to demonstrate that being solely selfish would have led to extinction. Game theory establishes models to simulate situations of conflict or cooperation, analyzing how individuals behave in these circumstances. In the \\"prisoner's dilemma,\\" two individuals are interrogated separately with a promise of freedom if one informs on the other. However, if both inform on each other (defect), they both get three months in prison, whilst if they both remain silent (cooperate), they both only get one month. Eminent mathematician John Nash suggested the optimal strategy was not to cooperate, leading to questions as to why we see cooperation in the animal kingdom, humans, and microbial world. This study suggests the missing factor was communication. When the prisoners cannot communicate, the temptation is to betray the other. But, if they could communicate, they would likely form a pact leading to the least amount of prison time. In the short term, selfishness might provide an advantage, but over the long term, it would lead to extinction. A 2012 study suggested that selfish individuals could advance beyond more cooperative ones, thus leading to a population of primarily selfish beings. This strategy, known as \\"mean and selfish,\\" relies on an individual's knowledge of their opponent's previous decision and adapting their strategy in response. However, in evolutionary terms, this advantage would not last long as the opponent would eventually develop the capacity to gauge your decisions as well. The Michigan State University team ran hundreds of thousands of games in a powerful computer model simulating a simple exchange of two behaviours - cooperation and defection. The results showed that the advantages of defection were short-lived. The findings also puts a check on overzealous interpretations of previous theories advocating manipulative, selfish strategies. The newly presented theory does not argue against Richard Dawkins' 1974 \\"selfish gene\\" theory, which suggested genes and not groups or organisms adapt and evolve, with body organisms serving as survival machines for these genes. Instead, it enhances the theory by suggesting that \\"selfish genes\\" could reap benefits from being part of cooperative groups or organisms. Thus, the study reiterates the value of cooperation in evolutionary survival and growth, debunking ideas that link evolution and survival to selfish, exploitative actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While speeding down a dirt road, they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub, sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator. As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub, they hear its mother coming and run. The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water. The Grizzly Bear finds and attacks Ritch. Having heard Ritch's screams to run, Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him. The other two arrive and rescue Wes, but are unable to help Ritch. The Bear kills him while the others flee to the Jeep. The vehicle starts again and they leave, but Wes panics and tries to force Sean to turn around and go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff.

As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. Paragraph: Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had observed the occurrence of natural selection? Answer:","completion":"The island that observed the occurrence of natural selection is Bank Island. Step 1: Understanding the Background - The background information provided talks about how a drought affected the finch populations on the Galápagos Islands. Due to the scarcity of seeds caused by the drought, finches with smaller beaks, who could only consume smaller seeds, died, while finches with larger beaks that could consume seeds of all sizes survived. This caused a change in the population, with the average beak size increasing over time. This is an example of natural selection, where traits favorable for survival in a given environment are passed on to the next generation. Step 2: Applying the Background to the Paragraph - Now, applying this information to the question, we know that Bank Island experienced a severe drought, which likely limited the food supply, similar to what happened in Galápagos. Step 3: Making the Inference - Given the similarity in situations, it can be inferred that Bank Island would likely observe the occurrence of natural selection, as only those birds adapted to deal with the scarcity of food would survive, reproduce and have their traits passed on to future generations. This would not be the case on Port Island, which had wet weather and presumably no drastic changes in food supply. Therefore, I conclude that natural selection was observed on Bank Island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Donna had to count the new manila files and old money. The","completion":"task seemed tedious, but she had her orders. As an accountant at the small law firm, it was her responsibility to keep track of every asset, even the most mundane items like manila folders and old cash lying around. Step 1: Gather the materials needed To carry out this task efficiently, she decided to first gather everything she needed. She assembled a notebook, pen, calculator, and a large workspace on her desk to make sorting and counting easier. This would help her avoid mixed numbers and ensure a well-organized process. Step 2: Separate and sort the items Donna started by separating the manila files and the old money into two distinct piles. Next, she sorted the manila files according to their size, making a separate stack for each size. She figured it would be easier to count them this way and avoid accidentally double-counting any files. Similarly, she sorted the old money by denomination, keeping the bills and coins in separate piles. Step 3: Count the manila files Beginning with the first stack of manila files, Donna began to count them one by one, careful not to overlook any or count a file twice. As she finished counting each stack, she wrote down the number of files in her notebook, labeling the entries based on size for easy reference. Step 4: Count the old money Following the same careful approach, Donna moved on to counting the old money. She started with the coins, grouping them into smaller piles of 10 to make counting more manageable. Once she had counted all the coins, she recorded the total value for each denomination. Moving on to the bills, she counted them individually and recorded the total value of each denomination in her notebook as well. Step 5: Calculate the totals With both the manila files and old money counted and recorded, Donna then calculated the total number of manila files by summing up the counts for each size. Next, she calculated the total value of the old money, factoring in the different denominations. Using her calculator, she added up the values of the bills and coins to arrive at a grand total. Step 6: Record and report the findings Now that she had the numbers, Donna input the count of the manila files and the total value of the old money into the firm's record-keeping system. She also sent a detailed report of her findings to her supervisor, ensuring transparency and accuracy in her role as the company's accountant. Step 7: Organize the items for storage Lastly, Donna packed the counted manila files neatly into boxes, labeling them with their respective sizes and quantities for future reference. She then secured the old money in a locked cash box and submitted it to the firm's secure storage area, where it could be properly monitored and controlled. By following these steps, Donna had not only completed the task at hand but also demonstrated her diligence, responsibility, and commitment to her role within the law firm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Context: The Federation Starship Enterprise returns to Earth following a battle with the superhuman Khan Noonien Singh, who tried to destroy the Enterprise by detonating an experimental terraforming device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral James T. Kirk's Vulcan friend, Spock, whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at Earth Spacedock, Doctor Leonard McCoy begins to act strangely and is detained. Starfleet Admiral Morrow visits the Enterprise and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is ordered not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)âKirk's son, a key scientist in Genesis's developmentâand Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis) are investigating the Genesis planet on board the science vessel Grissom. Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable \\"protomatter\\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis.

Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy.

In the discussion, Kirk and Sarek learn that prior to his death, Spock had transferred his katra, or living spirit, to Dr. Leonard McCoy. This features prominently into the story because Spock's katra and his physical body are necessary to ensure that he can be properly laid to rest on his home planet of Vulcan. If there's no intervention, it is believed that McCoy will die from carrying Spock's katra within him. This revelation subsequently triggers a series of events in the plot. In direct disobedience to orders, Kirk, together with other officers, facilitate McCoy's escape from detention. Not only that, but they also disable the USS Excelsior, and steal the Enterprise from Spacedock with the intention of returning to the Genesis planet.

Instead, it provides a summary of Benjamin Franklin's accomplishments and his legacy. To provide a more accurate answer: Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 and passed away in 1790. During his lifetime, the United States had no president until the creation of the U.S. Constitution and the election of its first president, George Washington, who took office in 1789.

The reviewer commends Dr. Elder's contribution as an \\"excellent and practical guide to trading and methodology.\\" This statement praises the content of the book and highlights its usefulness in providing valuable information for trading enthusiasts. However, the reviewer also adds a mildly negative or sarcastic remark, stating: \\"If you read this book just once, you don't have what it takes to be a trader. So keep your day job.\\" This particular statement may suggest that the complexities of trading require more than just a single read of the book to fully grasp and that anyone who believes they can easily become a trader after reading it once may be underestimating the challenges of the field. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment of the review leans more towards the positive side due to the praise for the book's content and practicality. The negative aspect, rather than reflecting poorly on the book itself, serves as a cautionary note for potential readers, emphasizing that trading is a demanding field and that mastering the concepts explained in the book needs dedicated effort and commitment. In conclusion, the product review can be considered positive, as it highlights the effectiveness and value of the book as a reference for aspiring traders.

(Alex Wong, Getty Images) SEC Chair Mary Jo White Thursday outlined plans for new regulations to address the market impact of high-frequency trading and other computer issues. Speaking at a New York City conference, White said the agency would soon propose rules that ultimately could: “The SEC should not roll back the technology clock or prohibit algorithmic trading, but we are assessing the extent to which specific elements of the computer-driven trading environment may be working against investors rather than for them,” said White. To that end, SEC will also work with stock exchanges in an effort to reduce disparities between the public data feeds used by small traders and the faster, proprietary feeds typically used by high-frequency traders, White said. The market regulator will also examine the reliability and fairness of market data feeds, White said in her speech at the Sandler O’Neill & Partners Global Exchange and Brokerage Conference. The proposal is aimed at addressing alarm raised last August when a Nasdaq public data feed failed, halting trading in Nasdaq-listed stocks for hours. Additionally, the SEC will work with Wall Street’s self-regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in an effort to expand disclosure by so-called dark pools, where trading takes place away from traditional stock exchanges. FINRA this week for the first time made some dark pool trading data available to average investors on a delayed basis. The proposals mark the SEC’s broadest public response so far to rising public questions about the impact of high-frequency trading and other computer-driven transactions, which together account for a majority of U.S. trading. Those concerns have intensified since the recent publication of Flash Boys, a book in which author Michael Lewis argued the stock market is rigged against average traders. White said the proposals would “further promote market stability and fairness, enhance market transparency and disclosures, and build more effective markets for smaller companies.” However, some of the initiatives could face opposition from high-frequency traders. Many of the proposals would also require a vote by the full, five-member commission after a public comment period. That likely means enactment could be months or years away. “In general, it’s a very reasonable regulatory approach to improving and strengthening the markets,” said Peter Nabicht, senior advisor of Modern Markets Initiative, an advocacy group organized by firms involved in quantitative or high-frequency trading. But he cautioned any regulatory changes pressed by the SEC should seek speed improvements in the public data feeds used by average investors, rather than try to slow the proprietary feeds that facilitate high-frequency trading. MMI will support “a reasonable, data-driven approach to improving the markets for investors,” said Nabicht.

Choices: - air - water - food - light A: Answer:","completion":"Photosynthesis is a complex biological process that occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of green plants, algae, and some bacteria. The process involves a series of reactions that largely depend on light energy, which is captured by photosynthetic organisms to synthesize carbohydrates and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be - light. However, it is worth mentioning that the other choices - air, water, and food - also play crucial roles in the process of photosynthesis. Here is a more detailed breakdown of their involvement: 1. Light: The primary energy source needed for photosynthesis is light, which is primarily absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (and other pigments) present in the chloroplasts of the plant cells. In the first stage of photosynthesis, called the light-dependent reactions, light energy is used to create high-energy molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These molecules play a critical role in fueling the subsequent stage of the process. 2. Air: Air contains carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the essential raw materials needed for photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide enters the plant through tiny pores called stomata that are present on the surface of leaves. In the second stage of photosynthesis, called the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is used to produce glucose (C6H12O6), a carbohydrate that serves as the primary energy source for plants. 3. Water: Water (H2O) serves as another crucial reactant in the photosynthesis process. It is absorbed by the roots of the plants and transported to the leaves through the vascular tissues in the stem. In the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Hydrogen is used to produce NADPH, and the oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of the process. 4. Food: Although food is not directly involved in the photosynthesis process, the products of photosynthesis – primarily glucose – serve as the primary food source for the plants themselves, as well as for the heterotrophs that feed on these plants. Glucose produced during photosynthesis may be used immediately to power the plant's cellular activities or stored in the form of starch for future energy needs. In summary, while light can be considered the primary dependency for photosynthesis, air and water are also essential components of the reactions. The glucose produced during this process serves as food for the plants and indirectly for other organisms in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - commercial building - muscians - theater - university building - downtown The answer is:","completion":"Downtown. Downtown areas are the most likely option to have at least one concert hall among the choices provided. This is because downtown areas typically represent the central business and cultural district of a city, where various entertainment venues are usually concentrated. Firstly, downtown areas often have numerous public spaces, such as parks, squares, and pedestrian zones, which are suitable for hosting open-air concerts or events. These locations attract both locals and tourists, providing a great opportunity for musicians and performers to draw in large audiences. Secondly, downtown areas typically have excellent connectivity to public transportation networks, making it convenient for concertgoers to travel to and from concert venues. The accessibility of such areas helps accommodate the increased traffic that concerts generate and ensures that more people can attend events, leading to higher ticket sales and revenue for performers. Thirdly, downtown areas frequently contain a mix of commercial, residential, and cultural institutions, such as art galleries, museums, and performance spaces. This creates a vibrant and lively atmosphere where people actively engage in various cultural activities. Therefore, it is more likely that a concert hall, as a key cultural venue, would be located in such a thriving cultural hub. In comparison, the other options have limitations. Commercial buildings are often designed for office spaces or retail stores rather than performance venues, and may not have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate concert halls. Musicians, as individuals or groups, do not constitute a physical area where a concert hall would be located. Theater venues, while similar in some ways to concert halls, are specifically designed for performing arts like plays and musicals, rather than concerts featuring musical performances. Lastly, university buildings usually contain auditoriums or performance spaces, but these are primarily intended for educational purposes, such as lectures or seminars, and may not have the capacity or features required for large concert halls. Therefore, based on the given options, downtown areas are the most suitable choice for the location of at least one concert hall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is the organic layer in an amoled screen Suggested answer: Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec Should I validate this answer? Possible answers: + No + Yes Answer:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer, as it does not accurately address the question asked. The question is about the organic layer in an AMOLED screen, but the suggested answer is discussing a prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec. To answer this question properly, we should focus on the organic layer in an AMOLED display. AMOLED stands for Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode. It is a type of display commonly used in smartphones, smartwatches, and other electronic devices due to its high contrast, low power consumption, and fast refresh rates. The organic layer in an AMOLED screen refers to the organic materials used in the construction of the light-emitting diodes. These organic materials are essentially thin films comprised of organic molecules, particularly polymers or small molecule compounds, applied between two conductive layers, the anode and the cathode. The organic molecules emit light when an electric current is applied. This light emission occurs due to a process known as electroluminescence, which involves the movement and recombination of charges within the organic layer. AMOLED technology employs a thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane to actively control each pixel. This active matrix approach allows for faster refresh rates compared to passive matrix OLEDs. AMOLED displays have a significant advantage due to their ability to display deep black levels, as individual pixels can be completely turned off when not emitting light. Additionally, they consume less power when displaying darker content compared to LCD-based technologies. In summary, the organic layer in an AMOLED screen refers to the organic materials used to create light-emitting diodes, facilitating the electroluminescence process. The suggested answer about Lumiotec's prototype OLED lighting panel is irrelevant to the original question and should not be validated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn't get it. They never did. And liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion. This film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, join his cause. Not just a few of them join the cause. By the time his movement reaches its zenith, entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more. Just to move this review along, I'm prepared to grant them this premise. Even though it would never happen in a million years, I'll just imagine it could, then go from there. I don't quite remember how, but some type of agreement is reached, and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene. Before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is poorly written, acted and directed. Even if one does agree with the boy's stance, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed. And that's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does as well as he could have with his character however, and I wish he would try to act in more films. Alas, it's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the NBA. One wishes Mr. English would teach more of these thuggish NBA types of today how to shoot the rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop. As far as the film's message in concerned, it's just wrong-headed. Plain and simple. All of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west PREVENTED WAR!!!!! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the USE of nuclear weapons. These weapons were in fact never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. Neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the USA and USSR. The makers of this film obviously intended for kids in America to take up their cause and follow in Chuck's footsteps. Kids in America however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck. The film is worth only 2 of 10 stars.

They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school--things you liked--because you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music. You're not going to be a musician. Don't do art. You're not going to be an artist. In addition, the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at wasn't valued at school. I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. But now you need a Master's degree where the previous job required a Bachelor, and now you need a Ph.D. for the other. It's a process of academic inflation , and it indicates the whole structure of education needs changing. All the great teachers I've ever met and worked with are people who can inspire interest and curiosity and light up people's imaginations with the interests they themselves have for a particular field of work. I mean, teaching is not only a process of giving people direct instructions and information they have to memorize, it is much more than that. I believe our only hope for the future is to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children. And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face the future.

Sonitus Technologies In the future, communicating in combat could be as simple as speaking into the microphone on your teeth. On Tuesday the US Department of Defense sealed a multimillion dollar investment into a futuristic two-way communications system dubbed the \\"Molar Mic,\\" slated for use by the US Air Force. Developed by California company Sonitus Technologies, the mouthpiece snaps onto the upper back molars (it's custom fit to each user) and has a wireless rechargeable battery, a waterproof microphone and a bone conduction speaker built in. The mouthpiece sends and receives communications via a wireless \\"tactical neckloop\\" that connects to traditional radios and phones. \\"Parachuting from high-altitude aircraft, working under a hovering helicopter, swimming in open water, and similar conditions, interfere with traditional communication devices precisely when they are needed most,\\" Sonitus says. Instead, the Molar Mic's bone conduction speaker relays audio straight to the wearer's inner ear without preventing them from hearing other noise or encumbering them with gear, according to Sonitus. \\"The result is an unobstructed head and face, clear communication, higher comfort, enhanced situational awareness and the ability to add or remove personal protective equipment without breaking communication,\\" Sonitus says. The Molar Mic is set to be deployed first by the US Air Force (with other branches of the military potentially following suit), but Sonitus says the tech could also be used by security personnel, industrial workers or first responders. ||||| U.S. Air Force is first to leverage audio interface system that enables clear communication in the harshest conditions; performing underwater, in free-fall, and when using full-face life support masks San Mateo, Calif. — September 11, 2018 Sonitus Technologies announced today that it has been awarded Phase II of its contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) which is structured to provide the U.S. Air Force with a novel new personal communication system that Air Force personnel have nicknamed the ‘Molar Mic.’ The innovative two-way, personal communication system, ATAC™, fits a miniaturized traditional headset into a device that clips to a user’s back teeth. The DOD, via its Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), has contracted Sonitus for a multi-million dollar, multi-year agreement, to complete development of the Molar Mic for purposes of transition to Fielding and Deployment of the system upon successful conclusion of the first segment of the contract which is funded by the U.S Air Force. Subsequently, other qualified branches of the U.S. defense community may leverage the technology as part of the DOD’s program to enhance communications capabilities and operational safety of its personnel. Sonitus was introduced to the DOD by In-Q-Tel, the not-for-profit strategic investor that identifies and partners with startup companies developing innovative technologies that protect and preserve U.S. security. “Sonitus Technologies is honored to bring this game changing technology to our country’s elite military, making them safer and more effective by enabling them to communicate clearly – even in the most extreme situations,” said Peter Hadrovic, CEO of Sonitus Technologies. “The voice interface sustains communications in dangerous and challenging environments. The Molar Mic is the first in our family of solutions that conventional approaches are unable to address.” Pararescuemen (commonly known as PJs) from the Air National Guard 131st Rescue Squadron based at Moffett Field in Mountain View, CA, participated in early field testing of the Sonitus prototypes, including rescue operations during Hurricane Harvey last summer in Houston. “The ability to communicate by radio is crucial for our mission,” said a PJ and DIU Warrior in Residence. “It enables us to execute in extreme conditions and save lives. But despite having amazing technology, communication still commonly breaks down because of the extreme environments where we operate.” In one case during Hurricane Harvey, a PJ was involved in airlifting an injured civilian into a helicopter hovering directly overhead and was attempting communication with the helicopter flight engineer and pilot using the Sonitus system. The crew was amazed that they could clearly hear the PJ in these conditions. Parachuting from high-altitude aircraft, working under a hovering helicopter, swimming in open water, and similar conditions, interfere with traditional communication devices precisely when they are needed most. What is needed is an entirely new approach. Sonitus Receives DOD/DIU Contract Sonitus Technologies uses a patented audio interface and near-field magnetic induction (NFMI) technology to achieve its performance. The recent award followed DOD-funded field-testing of prototypes by military personnel from all of the major service branches with extensive field experimentation. Testing included multiple scenarios, with and without personal protective equipment, all with extreme noise and without loss of communication. The Sonitus solution creates a unique wireless audio interface by embedding both a tiny microphone for talking and a speaker-transducer for hearing in a compact custom-fit mouth-piece that snaps comfortably around a user’s back teeth. This allows the user to both talk and hear without external devices attached to the head. The placement on the teeth uses the body itself to block external noise when speaking and leverages the user’s teeth and jawbone to create a new auditory path for hearing. The result is an unobstructed head and face, clear communication, higher comfort, enhanced situational awareness and the ability to add or remove personal protective equipment without breaking communication. Security personnel, first responders, and industrial workers such as those in the energy sector are evaluating the Sonitus solution for their market applications.

Media Contact: Rich Moore rbmoore7@gmail.com 415-608-7441 ||||| Communications devices have taken over our pockets and our wrists, but soon the gadgets may go even deeper. Patrick Tucker at Defense One reports that the Air Force has signed a 10 million deal with a California company to continue development of a communication device that is fitted to a users’ teeth. Dubbed the “Molar Mic,” the gadget is being designed by San Mateo-based Sonitus Technologies. Officially called the ATAC system, the two-way communication system consists of a small microphone that clips to a users back teeth. This enables them to hear communications through their cranial bones which transmit the sound to the auditory nerve. Users also wear a low-profile transmitter loop around their neck that connects to the Molar Mic via near-field magnetic induction, a system similar to Bluetooth that can be encrypted and also passes through water. The loop then connects with with a phone, walkie-talkie or other communications device. Communicating via the teeth takes a little getting used to. “Essentially, what you are doing is receiving the same type of auditory information that you receive from your ear, except that you are using a new auditory pathway — through your tooth, through your cranial bones — to that auditory nerve. You can hear through your head as if you were hearing through your ear,” Sonitus CEO Peter Hadrovic tells Tucker. “Over the period of three weeks, your brain adapts and it enhances your ability to process the audio [but even] out of the gate, you can understand it.” Why put the mic inside the mouth? According to a press release, the mic removes the need for headsets and other equipment that could get fouled up, allowing users to continue communicating during dangerous or active situations, such as parachuting out of an airplane, working near noisy helicopters, swimming in open water, or during rescue missions or firefights. Because it is hidden in the mouth, it can also be used discreetly by security personnel or undercover agents. The system has already been tested in the field. Tucker reports that airmen in Afghanistan tried it for 14 months while deployed, though not in active missions. Pararescuemen from the Air National Guard's 131st Rescue Squadron based at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, also tested the device in Houston last year during Hurricane Harvey. The team faced high water, noisy helicopters and other external noises that make traditional communication difficult. “This guy is standing in neck-deep water, trying to hoist a civilian up into a helicopter above. He says, ‘There is no way I would be able to communicate with the crew chief and the pilot if I was not wearing your product,” Hadrovic tells Tucker. But communication is just the first step. The company says in the future the platform could integrate other functions like keeping tabs on a soldier’s vital signs or location. Collecting biophysical data on soldiers is a goal of the military, which wants to use the data to figure out how stress, fatigue and other factors impact soldiers. The project is being supported by the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit, which was created in 2015 to keep the often slow-moving and cumbersome defense technology programs up to date with the latest advances coming out of Silicon Valley and the tech world. The agency now has offices in Boston, Washington D.C. and Austin. The Molar Mic isn’t its first successful technology transfer. In 2017, the unit helped negotiate a 750 million five year deal between cybersecurity firm Tanium and the Army. Jennings Brown at Gizmodo reports that Sonitus says it will not begin work on commercial versions of the Molar Mic until it finishes it military contract, meaning it will be a few years before we get to listen accept calls directly through our skull bones. ||||| Image: Sonitus A new communication device that is supposed to go inside military service members’ heads gives us a hint at the sort of technology a new Defense Department accelerator program is funding. Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter created the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) in 2015 with the mission of helping the military industrial complex catch up to the speed of Silicon Valley, especially with the development of drones, communication systems, and cybersecurity. But, as Gizmodo has pointed out before, the arduous bureaucracy of government agencies isn’t congruous with the disruption ethos of Big Tech.

Now one of the benefactors of this program, Sonitus, announced it has received a multi-million dollar contract to develop two-way communication devices that clip to the users’ teeth. The technology, dubbed “Molar Mic,” is supposed to be provided for U.S. Air Force service members first, but it might eventually be used by other military branches. Defense One reports that Sonitus was awarded about 10 million for the project. Sonitus CEO Peter Hadrovic explained to Defense One that using the Molar Mic is similar to hearing the sounds of cereal crunch inside your head, using the “auditory pathway” of your teeth. He said users can understand the audio as soon as they put it in, but it gets easier with use. “Over the period of three weeks, your brain adapts and it enhances your ability to process the audio,” Hadrovic told Defense One. Advertisement The device uses near-field magnetic induction to sync with a transmitter, similarly to Bluetooth. It’s custom-fit to the user’s mouth, then snaps into their molars. The microphone and wirelessly rechargeable battery are obviously built to be waterproof. The current prototype looks like it would be irritating and a choking hazard. But it would certainly be more convenient than a handheld device for people who are, say, jumping out of aircraft and swimming as apart of rescue missions and combat. Photo: Sonitus Advertisement Sonitus began developing the technology using funds from the CIA-focused non-profit venture capital group In-Q-Tel (a reference to Q, the fictional head of research and development behind James Bond’s gadgets and weapons). But Hadrovic would not tell Defense One if the CIA had used the technology. Sonitus reportedly did give prototypes to pararescue members in the Air National Guard’s 131st Rescue Squadron at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, through the DIUx “warriors in residence” program. And Hadrovic said some of those service members took Molar Mic prototypes to Afghanistan and provided feedback. Another group of pararescue members reportedly used Molar Mics during rescue operations in Texas after Hurricane Harvey. A spokesperson for Sonitus told Gizmodo the company won’t speculate about when the technology will be available for commercial, industrial, or consumer markets—and the company wont scale beyond military use until it completes the contract the Department of Defense just awarded them. So, we probably have at least a few years before civilians start lodging phones into their throats. Advertisement [Sonitus, Defense One] ||||| The future of battlefield communications is resting comfortably near your back gums. Next time you pass someone on the street who appears to be talking to themselves, they may literally have voices inside their head…and be a highly trained soldier on a dangerous mission. The Pentagon has inked a roughly 10 million contract with a California company to provide secure communication gear that’s essentially invisible. Dubbed the Molar Mic, it’s a small device that clips to your back teeth. The device is both microphone and “speaker,” allowing the wearer to transmit without any conspicuous external microphone and receive with no visible headset or earpiece. Incoming sound is transmitted through the wearer’s bone matter in the jaw and skull to the auditory nerves; outgoing sound is sent to a radio transmitter on the neck, and sent to another radio unit that can be concealed on the operator. From there, the signal can be sent anywhere. “Essentially, what you are doing is receiving the same type of auditory information that you receive from your ear, except that you are using a new auditory pathway — through your tooth, through your cranial bones — to that auditory nerve. You can hear through your head as if you were hearing through your ear,” said Peter Hadrovic, CEO of Molar Mic creator Sonitus Technologies. He likened the experience to what happens when you eat a crunchy breakfast cereal — but instead of hearing that loud (delightfully marketable) chewing noise, you’re receiving important communications from your operations team. Your ability to understand conversations transmitted through bone improves with practice. “Over the period of three weeks, your brain adapts and it enhances your ability to process the audio,” said Hadrovic. But even “out of the gate, you can understand it,” he said. (more below) The Molar Mic connects to its transmitter via near-field magnetic induction. It’s similar to Bluetooth, encryptable, but more difficult to detect and able to pass through water. Sonitus received early funding from In-Q-Tel, the nonprofit investment arm of the CIA, to develop the concept. Hadrovic declined to say whether CIA operatives had used the device in intelligence gathering. But the Molar Mic has seen the dust of Afghanistan and even played a role in rescue operations in the United States. In Aug, 2016, a connection Hadrovic met through In-Q-Tel introduced the company to the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx (since rebranded simply DIU). They linked Sonitus to their “warrior in residence” and several other pararescuemen, or PJs, from the Air National Guard’s 131st Rescue Squadron at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, near the DIU headquarters. Pararescuemen airdrop behind enemy lines to rescue downed aircrews. A few of the airmen took prototypes of the device on deployment to Afghanistan. Although they didn’t use it during missions, they were able to test it repeatedly and offer feedback. Hadrovic said the 14 months of testing were critical to improving the product for use by the military. In 2017, a few of the PJs from the 131st brought Molar Mic along when they deployed to Texas to help with rescue operations for Hurricane Harvey. Hadrovic said the airmen were pleased with its performance during complicated operations involving water, helicopters, and a lot of external noise. “This guy is standing in neck-deep water, trying to hoist a civilian up into a helicopter above. He says, ‘There is no way I would be able to communicate with the crew chief and the pilot if I was not wearing your product.’” (More below) A graph illustrating the communications network of the “Molar Mic” from Sonitus. The same technology holds the potential for far more rich biometric communication between operators and their commanders, allowing soldiers in the field and their team to get a timely sense of how the soldier is responding to pressure or injury, without him or her having to communicate all of that explicitly. It’s something that the military is working toward. “As we look to the future human-machine interface… the human creates a lot of information, some of it intentional, some of it unintentional. Speaking is one form of information creation,” says Hadrovic. “Once you’ve made something digital, the information can be interspersed…We have a tremendous wealth of opportunities to communicate out of the person and back to the person, information that can be either collected from them and processed offline and given back in a nice feedback loop. What we’ve done is invested in the platform that will support these future elements.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"California-based Sonitus Technologies has developed a near-invisible communication system called the \\"Molar Mic\\", following a 10m deal with the US Air Force.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose brother is married to an American woman in Los Angeles? Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The winner of the 2012 caucuses, we now know, was Rick Santorum. The loser, it’s becoming clear, was Iowa. The certified results released this week from the nation’s first presidential nominating contest revealed that Mitt Romney’s declared eight-vote victory on caucus night was actually a 34-vote defeat. They revealed that eight voting precincts went missing in action, and their votes will never be counted. And they were accompanied by evolving statements from the Republican Party of Iowa, which, having initially called the race for Romney, first declared this week’s result a “split decision” and only later acknowledged victory for Santorum. Such a muddled result and response threatens the already-contested legitimacy of Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status and underscores the need for reforms to professionalize the voting process, political observers and party officials said. “It’s bad. It really hurts the caucuses,” longtime Iowa observer David Yepsen said. “The caucuses have lots of critics, and for this to happen really jeopardizes the future of the event.” Criticism of Iowa’s place on the nominating calendar has long come from other states envious of the attention it receives, and has often focused on the demographic realities that make it unrepresentative of the country as a whole. But this year’s fumbled result opens a new line of attack: that Iowa’s process is amateurish, and that its results cannot be trusted. “Iowa was just indicted for not being able to add. We look silly,” said Yepsen, the director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale and a former Des Moines Register columnist. The Republican Party of Iowa issued this statement Friday night: “In order to clarify conflicting reports and to affirm the results released January 18 by the Republican Party of Iowa, Chairman Matthew Strawn and the State Central Committee declared Senator Rick Santorum the winner of the 2012 Iowa Caucus.” Larry J. Sabato, a respected elections forecaster and director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, called the caucuses’ shifting results an “embarrassment.” His Twitter feed, he said, has been a running stream of anti-Iowa invective in recent days. “People in a lot of other states are tired of Iowa going first, there’s no question about it,” he said. “And Iowa played right into the hands of its critics.” A big question, though, is whether such frustration will actually drive a challenge to Iowa’s pre-eminence in presidential cycles to come. In Yepsen’s view, this month’s “failure” (his word) certainly could prompt future candidates to shy away from Iowa and lead the media to discount its results. Others weren’t so sure, though. Drake University political scientist Dennis Goldford pointed to two factors in Iowa’s favor: Its botched results didn’t change the race in a meaningful way, and a debate over which state should succeed Iowa is almost surely more trouble than it’s worth. “It’s easy to pile on Iowa and the system we have, but as much as you dislike it, it’s probably less unpleasant than what you get into with proposals to change it,” Goldford said. It’s especially unclear how this month’s confusion will influence states that in the past have attempted to leapfrog Iowa for its first-in-the-nation status or the Republican National Committee, which polices the nominating process. Officials in Florida, for example, have long claimed that its large and diverse population is a more representative sample of the U.S. electorate, and thus more worthy of an early date on the nominating calendar. It attempted to force the issue this year when it moved its primary to Jan. 31, prompting Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to move their contests even earlier. Republican Party of Florida spokesman Brian Hughes said Friday it was “way too early to think about what might happen four or eight years down the road,” but couldn’t resist taking a shot at Iowa’s first-in-the-nation claim. “122,000 votes are cast, and it takes you two weeks to figure out who won?” Hughes said. “It does beg a question if that process makes a lot of sense.” Florida, he noted, has already received more than 122,000 absentee ballots for its Republican primary, and expects total turnout to approach 2 million. The Republican National Committee in the past has written a special rule allowing Iowa to schedule its caucuses ahead of most other states without penalty, but officials on Friday said it was far too early to predict how this year’s results would affect a similar rule in the future. “All in all, we’re happy with the outcome from the caucuses,” RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney said. “We had record turnout and a lot of enthusiasm from a state that’s going to be crucial in 2012.” Several observers agreed, however, that changes will be critical if the Iowa caucuses are to remain relevant. The 2012 contest, those observers said, revealed that while the caucuses have become a national focal point in the presidential election, their processes haven’t changed much since they were sleepy delegate-selection meetings. “The problem is you have a counting system that’s based upon a caucus that occurred in 1976 when everybody went over to Martha’s house, sat around a potbelly stove, and she wrote down the numbers on a slip of paper and called them in,” Yepsen said. Such an insular, volunteer-based, party-run system just doesn’t hold up under modern demands for accuracy and timeliness. “The difficulty is that the caucuses have come to have a political weight on them that they really weren’t designed to have,” Goldford said. Many options exist for buttressing the caucuses to withstand those pressures. Yepsen proposed professionalizing the voting process by bringing in county government to administer the balloting as they do in state and local elections. Such a step would surely cost money, he said, but the state may find it a worthwhile investment if it ensures the continuation of the caucuses as a national political spectacle. Sabato, the election forecaster, agreed. Nothing underscores skepticism about the caucuses like the notion of handwritten, hand-counted ballots. “They have to tighten their procedures,” Sabato said. “Little pieces of paper aren’t good enough.” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Ia., called for tighter security and improved reporting of caucus results Friday during an appearance on Iowa Public Television’s “Iowa Press” program. The party has three years to fix the problems and should start working, Grassley said. Craig Robinson, the editor of TheIowaRepublican.com website and a former state party official, suggested technological tweaks could improve caucus night returns and provide more accurate and timely certified results. Hiring telemarketing firms to double-check results or even just requiring precinct officials to photograph their final vote tallies could bring more security to the process, he said. But Robinson has been especially critical of Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Matt Strawn since the certified results were released, castigating him for declining to immediately declare Santorum the winner and calling for his resignation. “I think Matt Strawn himself has done more damage to Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status than any outside force ever could,” Robinson said. “The reason why is because he has cast doubt on the process.” TheIowaRepublican.com’s biggest funder/advertiser is the American Future Fund, which is run by Iowa GOP operative Nick Ryan, a Santorum consultant who left the campaign to start a pro-Santorum super PAC called Red White & Blue. In a statement provided to the Register on Friday, Strawn acknowledged there was “room for improvement” in the party’s caucus organization. “We will be soliciting feedback and input from voters, volunteers and Republican stakeholders in the coming weeks and months on ways to ensure Iowans and the nation have confidence in the caucus results and processes,” Strawn said in the statement. — The Associated Press contributed to this report.

However, Iowa Republican Party Chairman Matthew Strawn and the State Central Committee officially on Friday called the election for Santorum in a statement, re-emphasizing its announcement from the previous day. \\"In order to clarify conflicting reports and to affirm the results released ... by the Republican Party of Iowa, Chairman Matthew Strawn and the State Central Committee declared Senator Rick Santorum the winner of the 2012 Iowa Caucus,\\" the statement read. Original results from the contest on January 3 showed Romney had eked out a victory over Santorum by eight votes. The final results, however, were not certified until this week. Romney called Santorum on Thursday to congratulate him. – CNN's Shannon Travis and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.

At first, they said Mitt Romney won by 8 votes. But later, they found out Rick Santorum actually won by 34 votes. Oops! They also lost the votes from 8 places, so some people's votes didn't get counted. This made some people think the Iowa process isn't very good and needs to be more organized. Iowa is the first state to vote in the presidential race, and other states sometimes get jealous. Some people think this mistake could make Iowa less important in the future. But others think it's still important because changing it would be very hard. One thing is for sure: they need to make some improvements so mistakes don't happen again."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steven Noel Wariner was born on Christmas Day of 1954 in Noblesville, Indiana. Influenced at an early age by George Jones and Chet Atkins, Wariner started performing in his father's band, and later moved on to playing in local clubs. By age 17, he had been hired by Dottie West as a bass guitarist, and played on her single \\"Country Sunshine\\". He also worked with Glen Campbell, who he has cited as a major influence on his work. 1991 saw the release of Wariner's first album for Arista Records. Entitled I Am Ready, this was also the first album of his career to be certified gold for shipping 500,000 copies in the United States. Singles from it included \\"Leave Him Out of This\\", \\"The Tips of My Fingers\\" (a cover of Bill Anderson's 1960 single), \\"A Woman Loves\\", \\"Crash Course in the Blues\\" and \\"Like a River to the Sea\\". These first three singles were all Top 10 hits. In 1992, Wariner received his first Grammy Award, for Best Country Vocal Collaboration, as a guest vocalist and guitarist alongside Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs and fiddler Mark O'Connor on the single \\"Restless\\", a No. 25-peaking single from O'Connor's album The New Nashville Cats. He also collaborated with O'Connor on the No. 71-peaking \\"Now It Belongs to You\\" on the same album. His second album for Arista was 1993's Drive. Leading off this album was the Top 10 \\"If I Didn't Love You\\". After it came the Top 30 hits \\"Drivin' and Cryin'\\" and \\"It Won't Be Over You\\", although the album's title track stopped at No. 63. Wariner, along with Lee Roy Parnell and Diamond Rio, recorded a cover of Merle Haggard's \\"Workin' Man's Blues\\" as the fictional band Jed Zeppelin for the late-1994 tribute album Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard. This cover peaked at No. 48 and was made into a music video. A year later, Wariner contributed a cover of the song \\"Get Back\\" to Come Together: America Salutes The Beatles, a tribute album which included country music covers of songs by The Beatles. His rendition charted at No. 72 on the country charts and was also a music video shot primarily at Union Station in Nashville. An instrumental album, No More Mr. Nice Guy followed in 1996. His final Arista release, it produced no singles, although one of the tracks, \\"Brickyard Boogie\\", was nominated for Best Country Instrumental at the 1997 Grammy Awards. This track was a collaboration with Bryan White, Jeffrey Steele, Bryan Austin and former Pearl River guitarist Derek George. Despite exiting Arista in 1997, Wariner made a guest appearance along with Mac McAnally in the music video for Sawyer Brown's 1997 single \\"This Night Won't Last Forever\\", a cover of the Michael Johnson song.

Today, we're going to talk about a place called Honduras and the challenges they're facing. You know how you face challenges when you're trying to learn something new or maybe when you're doing your homework? Well, imagine if a whole country was having challenges too! Honduras is a beautiful country in Central America, but it's going through some tough times. They have two big challenges that they are trying to solve. To understand these challenges, we need to talk about a special place known as Renaciendo Juvenile Detention Centre. This is like a \\"time-out\\" place for kids who did something wrong, and it's near a city called Tegucigalpa. Now, let's pretend we're going for a ride to this \\"time-out\\" place. On the way, we can see how hard life is for some people in Honduras. The first big challenge for Honduras is called \\"crime.\\" Crime is when some people do bad things, like stealing or hurting others, and they break the rules. Many kids in Honduras live in difficult situations, without enough food or a good place to live, so they sometimes end up doing risky things. Then they have to go to this \\"time-out\\" place called Renaciendo Juvenile Centre. The other big challenge facing Honduras is poverty. Poverty is when people don't have enough money to buy the things they need, like food and clothes. Many kids don't have the chance to go to school because their parents can't pay for it. This makes it tough for them to have a bright future where they can get good jobs and be happy. These two challenges – crime and poverty – are really connected. If kids can't go to school and don't have enough to eat, they may feel like they have to turn to crime to survive. And when there are lots of kids in the \\"time-out\\" place, it's a sign that the challenges are still big. People in Honduras are working hard every day to make their country better and to solve these challenges. They want to make sure all kids can have a nice and safe life, just like you! By talking about it, like we're doing right now, we can help others learn about these problems too and maybe find some ways to help. So, always remember that no matter where we live, it's essential to have compassion for others and care about their lives. When we grow up, we can be part of the solution to make this world a better place for everyone, especially kids who need help in places like Honduras."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usually it is the highest rank in an army, and when it is, few (if any) persons are appointed to it. It is considered as a five-star rank (OF-10) in modern-day armed forces in many countries. - Marshal (also spelled marshall) is a term used in several official titles in various branches of society. As marshals became trusted members of the courts of Medieval Europe, the title grew in reputation. During the last few centuries, it has been used for elevated offices, such as in military rank and civilian law enforcement. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

The judge, a seasoned professional known for their keen eye for detail and dedication to upholding the law, entered the courtroom, signaling the beginning of what was bound to be an intense and grueling legal battle between the two opposing sides. The prosecution opened their case with a well-crafted, incisive statement that presented a series of allegations which, if proven true, would spell disaster for the defense. The alleged crimes were violent in nature, raising the stakes and the emotions running high in the courtroom. The public galleries were brimming with interested observers, journalists, and concerned family members of the accused and the alleged victims, their eyes fixated on the proceedings that would determine the fate of the individuals at the center of this gripping courtroom drama. The defense, however, countered with equal tenacity and resolve, presenting a vastly different narrative – one that painted their client as a victim of a complex web of deceit, manipulation, and false accusation. They promised to present evidence and testimony that would cast doubt on the prosecution's claims and ultimately exonerate the accused. As the trial progressed, both teams tirelessly examined and cross-examined witnesses, presented physical and digital evidence, and engaged in heated debates, attempting to sway the jury in their favor. Expert witnesses in various fields – from forensic science to psychology – provided their professional insights, while character witnesses testified about the accused's disposition and behavior. Outside the courthouse, the media coverage was relentless, dissecting every aspect of the case and offering in-depth analysis and commentary. The public was deeply divided, with vigilante groups and activists staging protests and demonstrations for and against the accused.

To better understand this, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis: The premise: The premise describes the combined effect of various policies, including program and Research & Development (R&D) expenditures, along with a 50 carbon charge referenced in the CEF Advanced Scenario, leading to a reduction in energy needs when compared to the CEF reference case. This suggests that the implementation of these mentioned policies effectively reduces energy consumption within the Advanced Scenario. The hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the CEF reference case underestimated energy needs by a large amount. This is a separate issue - underestimation of energy needs within the reference case - and does not directly involve the effects of the policies and R&D expenditures in the CEF Advanced Scenario.

This does not provide information on whether or not the reference case itself underestimates energy needs. 2. The hypothesis focuses on the accuracy of energy needs estimation in the reference case - a separate aspect of the CEF report. It does not address the effectiveness of the policies described in the Advanced Scenario. Given these points, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true, as they address different aspects of the CEF report and energy needs. Supporting or disproving the hypothesis would require additional data and analysis related to the reference case's estimation of energy needs."},{"prompt":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Write some highlights for the following article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Veteran Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party on Tuesday, saying he has found himself increasingly \\"at odds with the Republican philosophy.\\" Sen. Arlen Specter was expected to face a tough re-election battle in 2010. \\"This is a painful decision. I know I'm disappointing many of my colleagues,\\" he said at a news conference announcing the move. \\"The disappointment runs in both directions. \\"I'm putting principle at the top of the list,\\" he added. The switch puts Senate Democrats one vote shy of a filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats. They can reach the 60-seat mark if Al Franken holds his current lead in the disputed Minnesota Senate race. \\"As the Republican Party has moved farther and farther to the right, I have found myself increasingly at odds with the Republican philosophy and more in line with the philosophy of the Democratic Party,\\" Specter said. \\"In the course of the last several months ... I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak.\\" Specter, a five-term Senate veteran, was facing what most political observers believed would have been a tough fight for the Pennsylvania GOP Senate nomination in 2010. Specter said President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would campaign for him as he runs for re-election -- now on the Democratic ticket -- in the 2010 race. Obama called Specter shortly after learning the news during his daily economic briefing in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning, according to a senior administration official. \\"You have my full support, and we're thrilled to have you,\\" Obama told Specter. Jubilant Senate Democrats also welcomed the news. Watch constituents cheer for Specter ». \\"Sen. Specter and I have had a long dialogue about his place in an evolving Republican Party,\\" Reid, D-Nevada, said in a written statement. \\"We have not always agreed on every issue, but [he] has shown a willingness to work in a bipartisan manner, put people over party and do what is right for Pennsylvanians and all Americans.\\" Reid called Specter a \\"man of honor and integrity\\" who would be welcome in the Democratic caucus. One key Senate Democrat warned that reaching the 60-vote mark would not automatically ensure a Democratic victory on every major issue. \\"It's great news,\\" North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad said. But it means \\"a lot less\\" than some people think. \\"The Democratic caucus is not homogenous. [There is a] lot of disagreement in the Democratic caucus, so this idea that it's some great watershed event ... I don't think so.\\" Neither party has had a filibuster-proof majority in the U.S. Senate since the 95th Congress, from 1977 to 1979. The Democrats controlled 62 seats during the first two years of the Carter presidency. Learn about other senators who have switched parties ». Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele ripped Specter, calling him a Republican in name only who was out of step with the rest of the party because of his \\"left-wing voting record.\\" \\"Some in the Republican Party are happy about this. I am not,\\" Steele said in a written statement. \\"Let's be honest -- Sen. Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind. He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record.\\" Steele said Republicans \\"look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first.\\" Steele later said Specter essentially \\"flipped the bird\\" at the GOP leadership with his decision. Speaking to CNN's Gloria Borger and Kyra Philips, the chairman said it was \\"not only disrespectful but downright rude\\" of Specter to make this decision after the national party made it clear that it would stand behind him in a contentious primary fight. Watch more of Steele's comments ». National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John \\"Cornyn went out on the line for this man,\\" he said. \\"For the senator to flip the bird back to Sen. Cornyn and the Republican Senate Leadership, a team that stood by him, who went to the bat for him in 2004, to save his hide is not only disrespectful but down right rude. \\"I'm sure his mama didn't raise him this way,\\" Steele added. Specter was expected to face a very tough primary challenge in 2010 from former Rep. Pat Toomey, who nearly defeated Specter in the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary in 2004. A Quinnipiac University survey of registered Pennsylvania voters released last month showed Specter trailing the more conservative Toomey in a hypothetical primary matchup, 41 to 27 percent. Watch why Specter decided to switch ». A separate Franklin & Marshall survey showed Specter leading Toomey 33 to 18 percent. Another 42 percent, however, were undecided. More than half of the Republicans polled in the Franklin & Marshall survey said they would prefer to see someone new in the Senate. Specter singled out the conservative group Club for Growth, which endorsed Toomey in 2004 and has endorsed him for 2010, as one the primary culprits behind his increasing political isolation in the Pennsylvania GOP. He argued that the organization, which targets moderate GOP incumbents who do not adhere to the doctrine of supply-side economics, had helped undermine the competitiveness of the Republican Party across much of the country. Club for Growth members and other conservatives \\"don't make any bones about their willingness to lose the general election if they can purify the party,\\" he said. \\"I don't understand it, but that's what they say. ... There ought to be a rebellion [against them]. There ought to be an uprising.\\" But Club for Growth President Chris Chocola replied in a statement, \\"Sen. Specter has confirmed what we already knew: He's a liberal devoted to more spending, more bailouts and less economic freedom. Thanks to him, Democrats will now be able to steamroll their big government agenda through the Senate. \\"This cynical play for political survival calls into question whether Pennsylvania taxpayers can believe anything Arlen Specter says.\\" Numerous Republicans are angry with Specter over his recent vote in support of President Obama's 787 billion stimulus plan. \\"When the stimulus package came up for a vote, I felt that it was indispensable to vote aye in order to avoid the possibility of a 1929-type depression,\\" Specter said. He said that the vote highlighted a \\"schism\\" and an \\"irreconcilable conflict\\" between himself and the bulk of the GOP. Specter, one of only three GOP senators to vote for the measure, has been part of a dwindling group of GOP moderates from the northeastern part of the country. The 79-year-old Kansas native and former Philadelphia district attorney has been a leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee for much of the past two decades, serving as its chairman from 2005 to 2007. Specter has been a defender of abortion rights in an overwhelmingly anti-abortion party and opposed Reagan's controversial nomination of Robert Bork to a Supreme Court seat in 1987. But he drew criticism from many women for his aggressive questioning of law professor Anita Hill, who accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during Thomas' 1991 confirmation hearings. Specter served on the Warren Commission, which investigated the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, helping develop the so-called single bullet theory that Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally were hit by the same slug. He has survived bouts with cancer three times, most recently undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease in 2005. CNN's Ed Hornick and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","completion":"Veteran Pennsylvania Sen.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Choosing the best book for fluid mechanics and hydraulic machines can be subjective, as preferences and needs differ between individuals. However, several textbooks are popular among students and professionals for their coverage of both theoretical and practical aspects of fluid mechanics and hydraulic machines. Some of these notable books include: 1. \\"Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines\\" by Dr. R.K. Bansal This book is widely known for its easy-to-understand language and presentation of basic principles, key concepts, and numerous solved examples. The book also contains extensive information on hydraulic machines, which makes it suitable for both undergraduate and graduate engineering students. 2. \\"A Textbook of Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines\\" by Rajeev K. Bansal This comprehensive textbook is designed for engineering students at various levels. It includes a step-by-step approach to solving problems and covers fundamental principles, properties of fluids, fluid statics, kinematics, and dynamics, and also contains a dedicated section on hydraulic machines. 3. \\"Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines: A Lab Manual\\" by S.K. Mittal This book provides a hands-on approach for students to understand fluid mechanics and hydraulic machines. It covers important experiments that help learners visualize complex concepts and enhance their practical knowledge. 4. \\"Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines: Problems and Solutions\\" by K. Subramanya This book focuses on problem-solving techniques and contains numerous solved problems, making it ideal for students preparing for exams and interviews. As for your second question, \\"Which is the best book for fluid machinery?\\" - it appears to be a paraphrase of the first question, as it also seeks recommendations for a book on fluid mechanics and hydraulic machines. However, the second question places more emphasis on the fluid machinery aspect, which can be interpreted as a specific subset of fluid mechanics and hydraulic machines. In conclusion, these two questions are paraphrased versions of each other, with slight differences in focus. To answer both, I would recommend considering the books mentioned above for a comprehensive understanding of fluid mechanics, hydraulic machines, and fluid machinery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve 0 = 75*g + 11 + 64 for g.","completion":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this together step by step! First, we have this math problem: 0 = 75*g + 11 + 64. Step 1: Let's put together the numbers that are all by themselves, those are called constants. So, we add 11 and 64 together, like we are adding apples or toys. When we do that, we get 75. So now, our problem looks like this: 0 = 75*g + 75. Step 2: Now, let's get rid of that 75 that's adding with g. We want g to be by itself, just like when you want to play with your favorite toy alone. To get rid of that \\"+75\\", we do the opposite - we subtract 75 from both sides. So, we subtract 75 from 0 (which is our left side) and we get -75, and our problem now looks like this : -75 = 75*g. Step 3: The last step is getting 'g' by itself. Right now, it's being multiplied by 75. To undo that, we do the opposite - we divide. So, we divide both sides by 75. When we do that we get: -75 / 75 = g. And finally, when we divide -75 by 75, we find that 'g' is -1. So, the solution to your problem is g = -1.

Fossils can be used to match up rock layers. As organisms change over time, they look different. Older fossils will look different than younger fossils. Some organisms only survived for a short time before going extinct. Knowing what organisms looked like at certain times also helps date rock layers. Some fossils are better than others for this use. The fossils that are very distinct at certain times of Earths history are called index fossils. Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers. You can see how this works in Figure 2.30.

Today, we are going to talk about a new study that tells us more about earthquakes in the United States. Earthquakes are when the ground shakes really hard because of movements deep below the Earth's surface. Scientists who study rocks, soil, and how the Earth changes are called geologists. They work to learn more about the Earth and keep people safe from natural events like earthquakes. These geologists did a big study using special tools and techniques to help them figure out where earthquakes could happen in the future. This new study found that some places in the United States, especially along the east coast, have a higher chance of having earthquakes than before. The east coast is where states like New York, North Carolina, and Florida are. The people who live in these places might feel the ground shake more often than they used to. But don't worry! The geologists made this study to help people understand what's happening beneath the Earth's surface better. Knowing more about earthquakes helps engineers build stronger houses, schools, and buildings. It also helps people be prepared and know what to do if an earthquake happens.

After the opening credits, a line of Mujahedin are shown approaching a roadway where a squad of Soviet soldiers has been slaughtered. They dispatch the lone Soviet survivor with a knife. Soviet reinforcements arrive, and the guerrillas are defeated. As one of them is being interrogated, Major Bandura appears. On Bandura's orders, the prisoner is thrown into a truck which is then soaked with petroleum and set ablaze. After reporting the incident, Bandura meets a green new junior officer, a son of top brass transferred from Czechoslovakia. Bandura is amused by the kid's enthusiasm. Bandura negotiates some R and R for his weary company.

According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting.

Answer:","completion":"False The Cash and Carry and Lend-Lease policy were significant strides taken by the United States during World War II to assist its allies without directly involving themselves in the conflict. While the suggestion states that the United States did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation, it is only partially accurate, and it does not fully describe the two policies in question. The Cash and Carry policy was established by the Neutrality Act of 1939. Under this policy, the United States allowed warring nations to purchase goods and arms from the U.S., but required them to pay in cash and transport the goods using their own transportation. The policy was designed to avoid the U.S. taking sides or becoming entangled in the war but permitted Americans to sell goods to any belligerent nation that could make the appropriate payment methods and arrangements for transportation. The Lend-Lease Act, also known as the \\"An Act to Promote Defense of the United States,\\" was an American program implemented in 1941 that allowed the U.S. to provide aid to foreign nations during World War II in the form of war materials, food, fuel, and other essential resources. Under Lend-Lease, the United States could lend or lease goods to its allies, with the expectation that they would be either returned or replaced after the conflict. The program was not entirely cost-free for recipient nations, as they were expected to pay for the aid they received but were given more lenient terms of payment, which could be deferred or settled in various ways, such as providing the U.S. with access to military bases. As the Cash and Carry and Lend-Lease policy were two distinct programs with specific guidelines and provisions, the suggestion that the \\"United States did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation\\" does not provide a complete or accurate description of both policies.

Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora.

Guido sets up many \\"coincidental\\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement.

After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment.

After all, we live in New York City, and getting around by public transportation is a basic part of life. It is also the first step toward feeling grown-up. So on that sunny Sunday,I gave him a subway map, a transportation card,20 for emergencies, and a couple of coins so that he could call me if necessary. I didn't give him a cell phone because nine-year-olds lose things. A few days later, I wrote about his adventure,or non-adventure for a newspaper. Little did I realize the idea that a kid could tour the city on his own, and that a mom would let him, was big news. It turned out that many TV shows called me and asked for an interview. Bloggers were going crazy, so I started a blog, too, and letters came pouring in. Finally I found out why this was such a big story: we have become fearful for our children. Fear is hardly a new thing for parents, of course. But the fear of letting our children out of sight for even a second-that's new. How did this happen? How did it become too scary to let kids be kids? I asked the question when the reporter Trevor Butterworth interviewed me. \\"News reports,\\" he answered. \\"News reports scare the pants off you. What is scarier than a kidnapped kid no matter how far away?Because there are so many such stories, it starts to feel as if kidnappings are happening all the time.

Translate to English","completion":"However, Turkey, which began its negotiations in October 2005 in the same manner, has fallen significantly behind, having only opened eight negotiation chapters and temporarily closed one to date. Turkey initiated its accession negotiations with the European Union (EU) in October 2005 with the goal of becoming a full member. The negotiation process is organized into a series of chapters that cover various policy areas and require the candidate country to align its policies and legislation with those of the EU. This process is intended to ensure that the candidate country is well-prepared to fully participate in the various areas of cooperation within the EU once it becomes a member. In Turkey's case, this process has been slow-moving and challenging, with progress being made on only a limited number of chapters. Out of a total of 35 chapters, Turkey has so far only opened negotiations on eight and has temporarily closed one. This slow pace has been the result of various factors including political instability within Turkey, concerns about the country's human rights record, and difficulties in implementing necessary reforms in policy areas such as the rule of law, justice, and home affairs. In addition, the accession process has been further complicated by the political climate within the EU itself. Several EU member countries have been skeptical about Turkey's accession due to various reasons, such as its large population, economic disparities, and cultural and religious differences. The rise of nationalist and Eurosceptic political movements in some European countries has further fueled opposition to Turkey's membership, putting additional obstacles in Turkey's path to accession. As a result of these challenges, Turkey's accession process has stagnated over the years, leaving the country trailing significantly behind in its efforts to join the EU. While Turkey's membership prospects remain uncertain, it is important for both Turkey and the EU to continue engaging in constructive dialogue and cooperation, with the aim of fostering better relations and promoting shared values and interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pour in the beef broth or preferred sauce: Once the ribs are browned, pour the beef broth or your chosen sauce and bring it to a gentle boil. You may add water if necessary to ensure that the ribs are entirely submerged. 6. Add the vegetables: Peel and chop the potatoes and carrots into similar sizes, then add them to the pot. Depending on your preference, you may add other vegetables like corn, radish, or taro. 7. Simmer the dish: Reduce the heat to low and let the ingredients simmer. The key to a tender and juicy Nilagang Baboy is slow cooking, so allow the ribs to cook for at least 1½ to 2 hours. 8. Add more vegetables: Approximately 10 minutes before the cooking time is up, add the remaining vegetables like green beans and cabbage. Season the dish with fish sauce or salt to taste. 9. Serve hot: Once the ribs are tender and the vegetables are cooked, you can serve the Nilagang Baboy hot alongside steamed rice. By following these steps, you can enjoy a comforting and flavorful Nilagang Baboy that highlights the tenderness of the pork ribs and the melding of flavors from the rich broth and the variety of vegetables."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select from: A. Yes B. No Answer:","completion":"Answer: B. No The correct answer to the question \\"what is a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated?\\" would not be \\"dangerous.\\" The term \\"dangerous\\" is an adjective that could describe the potential severity or harm posed by a disease, but it does not actually identify a specific disease. In the information provided, you mentioned that leukemia is a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated. As such, the correct answer to the question would be \\"leukemia.\\" Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. It is characterized by the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which can ultimately interfere with the normal functioning of the immune system and other vital bodily processes. Malfunctions in the cell cycle, a series of events that lead to cell division and duplication, are often at the root of various cancers, including leukemia. Under normal circumstances, the cell cycle is a tightly regulated process that ensures cells divide only when necessary and maintain their correct size and function. When these regulatory mechanisms fail, cells may divide uncontrollably and accumulate genetic mutations that could result in the formation of cancerous tumors. Leukemia, like many cancers, can indeed be dangerous if not detected and treated early, potentially leading to serious health complications and even death.

And the answer is?","completion":"The picturesque railway line named after a bird that runs from Norwich to Cromer and then onto Sheringham is known as the Bittern Line. This route stretches over 30 miles through the beautiful landscapes of Norfolk, and it is named after the Bittern, a well-camouflaged and elusive bird that inhabits the reed beds in the surrounding area. The Bittern Line begins at Norwich railway station, the main railway hub in Norfolk, with various services operating between Norwich and other major cities. From Norwich, the scenic journey heads north to the charming and historic market town of Wroxham, which is often described as the 'capital of the Norfolk Broads.' This is due to its location at the heart of the network of navigable waterways and rivers, making it a popular spot for boating and other outdoor recreational activities. Continuing its picturesque journey, the Bittern Line passes through several stations, including Salhouse, Hoveton & Wroxham, Worstead, and North Walsham. These smaller towns and villages showcase the unique charm that Norfolk exudes, with attractions like Neolithic sites, ancient parish churches, and traditional English architecture. The Bittern Line then approaches Cromer, a delightful coastal town well-loved for its sandy beaches, cliff-top views, Victorian pier, and the famous Cromer crab. Cromer has been a popular vacation destination since Victorian times and still encompasses the classic British seaside experience with its fish and chip shops, amusement arcades, and beautiful gardens. From Cromer, the Bittern Line heads just a few miles west to the historic coastal town of Sheringham. This vibrant town boasts a good mix of traditional and modern living, with a bustling high street and a range of arts and crafts shops, alongside a charming steam railway known as the North Norfolk Railway, or \\"Poppy Line.\\" Sheringham is also the gateway to the stunning Sheringham Park, with its beautiful landscaped grounds and scenic walks. The Bittern Line, with its captivating scenery and numerous tourist attractions along the route, offers visitors a chance to explore the unique and picturesque landscapes of Norfolk while enjoying the nostalgia of a classic British railway journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the modern name of the photograph by the commercial photographer that inspired an 1888 oil painting? from the following article ? Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title. During the era of the collodion process, before the...

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone. Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. In which century plant species in northeast Michigan were in less stress, sixteenth century or twentieth century? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the sixteenth century, plant species in northeast Michigan were in less stress compared to the twentieth century. In the sixteenth century, Michigan had forests consisting of elm and oak trees. During this time, the natural vegetation and ecosystem were able to function without the significant human interference that occurred in the following centuries. The natural buffering properties of the ecosystem helped prevent issues related to groundwater salinization and allowed plant species to thrive without facing the challenges of high salinity. In the twentieth century, much of the natural vegetation had been cleared, making way for farmland. This change resulted in increased irrigation, which contributed to higher water tables, mobilization of salts, and increased salinity. Vegetation clearance also exposed the area to water habitats, putting species not adapted to high salinity under stress. As a result, plants experienced reduced water uptake, stomatal closure, and less efficient photosynthesis. This led to a decline in forests and a higher susceptibility to droughts, making the twentieth-century plants more stressed overall. In conclusion, plant species in northeast Michigan faced less stress in the sixteenth century due to the presence of natural forest ecosystems that mitigated issues related to salinity and drought. In the twentieth century, human activities like agriculture and irrigation contributed to higher stress levels for plants in the region due to increased salinity and vulnerability to droughts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you want to bring magic into your life, then bringing it into your home is a great way to accomplish that. By blessing your home, you can make your home a special place through the use of ritual. Rituals work by using symbolic actions in order to bring about a certain attitude or feeling about a place or thing, connecting the “sacred” to the “profane”. Although these symbolic connections are up to you to define, there are some common associations that you can make use of. Lavender, cedar-wood, and eucalyptus are all believed to have cleansing properties. You may want to do your blessing as the sun rises, facing it in the east, as the symbolic connection to the new day can make your house feel like a new, magical space. Cleaning your house can have an effect on your mood and how you view the spaces you live in. By giving your house a good cleaning before you start your blessing, you also send the message to yourself that you are making a change, clearing the space before your turn it into one of your own making. Clean your entire house while focusing on your intention that you are reforming your environment. Cleaning can send the message to yourself that you have control over your environment and are working to improve it. Before you begin the blessing itself, you will want to take a moment to set up the space you will be using. In setting the mood you want to create by engaging the senses, you can help make your blessing feel more magical and special to you, as well as anyone else doing the blessing with you. Light some incense or use a diffuser and essential oils. Play some music that puts you in the mood you want to be in during your blessing. Say some words that feel important to you and express your intent for the entire house and the goals of the ritual. Some spiritual traditions make use of burning candles during a ritual. When candles are used for spiritual purposes, it is common to consider the color of the candle, which have symbolic associations attached to them. You may also want to carve symbols that you enjoy into the candle. It is believed that as the candle burns, those symbolic aspects are projected outwards, into the environment. White candles are sometimes associated with purification. Light blue candles are thought to bring about harmony and joy. Yellow candles can represent joy and happiness. Move from room to room with your candle, speaking a blessing for each room. The blessing you say can be as long or as short as you like, so long as it contains your wishes for that room. Visit every room in your home with your candle so that you bless the entire house. An example affirmation for your bedroom might be “When I am in this space I will feel safe and secure. I will sleep and awake well rested.” By making these affirmations in your rooms, you focus on positive thinking about them and yourself when you visit them. This positive thinking can bring with it numerous health benefits. Most traditions believe that when using a candle in a ritual, it should be allowed to burn down completely. The underlying belief is that the candle is releasing your intention as it burns and blowing it out will cause this to stop. Burning the candle fully is thought to produce the maximum effect. Never leave your candle unattended while it is burning. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the process of bringing magic into one's life by blessing their home through the use of rituals, such as symbolic actions and associations, utilizing cleansing properties of various elements, setting up the space for the blessing, using candles with specific colors and meanings, and moving through each room with the intention of focusing on positive thinking, ultimately resulting in improved well-being and a transformed environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chief Constable Ma","completion":"Title: The Lizard's Trail Step 1: Introduce Setting and Main Characters Justification: Establishing the world and the principal characters will help the audience to understand the story and become invested in it. Setting: A bustling metropolitan city plagued by a rise in criminal activities and unsolved cases. The city police force is overwhelmed and is struggling to maintain law and order. Main Characters: 1. Lizard: A mysterious vigilante with incredible skills and cunning, who has been taking down criminals in the city, leaving a signature mark at every crime scene - a lizard symbol. 2. Chief Constable Ma: A dedicated and highly respected cop, tasked with leading an investigation into the Lizard's identity and activities. 3. Detective Li: A young, morally conflicted detective, who secretly admires the Lizard, despite technically being on the side of law enforcement. Step 2: Introduce the Conflict Justification: Introducing a dilemma or tension that the main characters must face, propelling them into action and kickstarting the story. Conflict: As the Lizard's interference in criminal operations begin to disrupt the power dynamics in the city, both the criminal underworld and the police force become desperate to unmask the enigmatic figure. The struggle heats up when a rising crime lord, Viper, puts a bounty on the Lizard's head. Step 3: Establish Relationships and Develop Characters Justification: Character development and relationship dynamics will further engage the audience, adding depth and emotional stakes to the story. 1. Chief Constable Ma becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth about the Lizard, both duty-bound and insatiably curious. 2. Detective Li starts to question his own loyalties, torn between his duty as a cop and his admiration for the Lizard's unconventional methods. 3. The Lizard is revealed to have a personal tie to one of the characters, which is tied to the origins of their vigilantism. Step 4: The Climax Justification: The climax heightens the story's tension and provides an opportunity for the characters to make consequential choices, leading to a resolution. As the story develops, Detective Li discovers the Lizard's identity and faces a critical choice: to expose the Lizard or to protect their secret. The two join forces to take down Viper and his crime empire, but the ensuing destruction puts them in Chief Constable Ma's crosshairs. In the final confrontation, Chief Constable Ma is forced to choose between arresting the Lizard and acknowledging the positive impact they've had on the city. Step 5: Resolution Justification: Concluding the story with a resolution provides closure and satisfies the audience's curiosity about the outcome of the characters' choices. Chief Constable Ma ultimately decides not to apprehend the Lizard, recognizing that their unconventional methods have made a significant impact on the fight against crime. However, Ma makes it clear that the Lizard's actions still break the law and issues a warning that their future actions will be closely monitored. This resolution satisfies the audience's questions while leaving room for further exploration in potential sequels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Approachable Personality: Christopher had a warm and friendly demeanor, which made the children feel comfortable and at ease in his presence. Neil, on the other hand, was a bit more reserved and aloof, causing the children to feel less connected to him. 2. Active Listener: Christopher genuinely listened to what the kids had to say, making them feel valued and respected. This made it easy for them to express their thoughts and feelings around him, unlike with Neil who had a tendency to seem distracted or dismissive. 3. Sense of Humor: Christopher possessed a great sense of humor, and he knew how to use it to lighten the mood and bring joy to the children. Neil's jokes, on the other hand, seemed forced and rarely made the kids laugh. 4. Creativity: One of the things that really stood out about Christopher was his impressive imagination. He would often create new games or bedtime stories to keep the children entertained, whereas Neil relied on the standard, repetitive activities. 5. Patience: Christopher displayed tremendous patience while dealing with the children, even during difficult moments when they were stubborn or uncooperative. Neil, in contrast, would often lose his temper or become visibly frustrated. 6. Adaptability: Each child has unique needs, and Christopher demonstrated an ability to adapt to these individual differences in temperament, interests, and comforts. This made the kids feel more understood and cared for, as opposed to Neil who, at times, struggled to relate to their individual needs. These factors contributed to the kids' preference for Christopher. They felt safe, cared for, and genuinely enjoyed spending time with him. Although Neil was a capable babysitter, he simply did not connect with the children on the same level that Christopher did, causing them to gravitate toward Christopher's warmth, patience, and entertaining nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You will need to have some kind of legal structure for your business. Consulting with an expert, such as a small business attorney or a Small Business Administration office, will help you make sure that your business gets what it needs to succeed. A small business attorney can help you figure out what the best structure will be for your needs. An attorney will also be able to guide you through the process of obtaining permits and licenses, as well as ensuring that you comply with any regulations in your area. The US Small Business Administration has District Offices throughout the country that offer free counseling and advice about how to start a small business. You can find a local office on their website. They also have over 900 “Small Business Development Centers” (SBDCs) that can help you plan and execute your business decisions. Many restaurant and coffee shop owners go with a Limited Liability Company (LLC), which protects your personal assets in case the business runs into trouble. While you can run your business as a “sole proprietorship,” this is usually not a good idea, as your personal assets are usually on the line if your business incurs liabilities. You may also want to consult with a small business accountant. The work of running your restaurant may be so much that you need to hand the bookkeeping over to someone else. Restaurants and coffee shops are small businesses, so they must be located within a commercial zone. You must acquire the necessary permits and other documentation before proceeding. Most areas will not allow you to sell food or beverages unless you have a commercial kitchen on-site. This means that home-based businesses are usually out. The SBA has a “Permit Me” tool that will help you determine what licenses and permits your state requires. Health codes vary depending on your location, but in order to establish a business that will sell food and/or drinks, you must comply with all the local regulations regarding food safety. Be aware that you will generally need to submit your application to your local environmental health department at least a month in advance of opening your business. You should also be aware of any particular regulations involving the sale of alcohol. While laws vary depending on your location, the laws surrounding alcohol are generally complex, so make sure you understand them. You’ll want to make sure that your restaurant or coffee shop is in a convenient, easily accessible location. Often, nearby businesses will help generate foot traffic that can benefit your business too. It is generally much cheaper to renovate an existing restaurant or coffee shop than it is to build one from scratch (or convert a non-eatery to an eatery). You may want to lease rather than purchase, especially if you have never operated a small restaurant or coffee shop before. Make sure to consider things like parking facility, rent rates, and city/county ordinances when choosing your space. Check out the history of the site, too; if there have been eight failed restaurants in your space before yours, there could be something about the site that isn’t great for food service establishments. Restaurants and coffee shops have many areas that could open you up to liability, including worker safety, food safety, and liquor liability. Many areas require any restaurant or coffee shop that sells alcohol to carry liquor liability insurance, which will protect your business against lawsuits or liability from wrongdoing resultant from alcohol consumed at your business. In most areas, you’ll also need to carry workers compensation insurance. Even if not required, insurance is an excellent idea. Property insurance and general liability insurance will help protect you and your business. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is that for setting up a successful restaurant or coffee shop, it is essential to consult with experts such as a small business attorney and the Small Business Administration (SBA). They provide guidance on the best legal structure (usually an LLC), obtaining permits and licenses, and adhering to relevant regulations. Health codes, especially food safety and alcohol sale regulations, are crucial to follow.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The cost of medical care in the United States is very high. The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem. A visit to a doctor's office costs from 15 to 50 dollars. It's so expensive. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care.

Kerry, who has made climate change a central focus of his career and will now begin preparing a decision. View Graphic Map of the Keystone XL pipeline. President Obama said in June that he would sign off on the proposal only if it “does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem.” The State Department report “includes a range of estimates of the project’s climate impacts, and that information will now need to be closely evaluated by Secretary Kerry and other relevant agency heads in the weeks ahead,” White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said in a statement Friday. The decision remains politically fraught for Democrats. Environmental activists fiercely oppose it, arguing that the pipeline could leak, would accelerate development of the greenhouse gas-intensive oil sands in Alberta and would increase the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels. Wendy Abrams, founder of the Chicago-based nonprofit group Cool Globes and a major Democratic campaign contributor, said she felt a “gut-wrenching pain for my kids” when she read the report. She said it made her question her past support of Obama and Kerry. “If they can’t get it done, what am I hoping for?” The State Department’s report includes 11 volumes of analysis on how the proposed pipeline would affect heavy-crude extraction in Canada’s oil sands and reaches the same conclusion as its draft report did in March: No single infrastructure project will alter the course of oil development in Alberta. The report said that “the proposed Project is unlikely to significantly affect the rate of extraction in oil sands areas (based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios).” Last week, TransCanada began shipping oil through the southern leg of the Keystone pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Okla., to Port Arthur, Tex. But the company is still waiting for a State Department permit for the 1,179-mile northern leg that would carry heavy crude from Canada into Montana and run to the small town of Steele City, Neb. The U.S. State Department issues an environmental review of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, that played down the impact it would have on climate change. (Reuters) “We’re very pleased with the release and about being able to move to this next stage of the process,” said Russ Girling, chief executive of TransCanada. “The case for the Keystone XL, in our view, is as strong as ever.” He said it would take about two years to construct the northern leg, but he cautioned that summer is best for construction and that a long permit process could further delay the project. Jones, the State Department official, said the report “presents considerable analysis, but it does not answer the broader question about how a decision on the proposed project would fit into the broader national and international efforts to address climate change or other questions of foreign policy or energy security.” She added that the study relied on assumptions about pipeline capacity, oil prices and transportation and development costs that were “uncertain and changeable.” Oil industry officials welcomed the fact that the department had affirmed the idea that the pipeline decision did not have a major climate impact. “Time and time again, State reaches the same conclusion despite the unprecedented and thorough environmental review,” said Cindy Schild, the American Petroleum Institute’s senior manager for oil sands policy. She said that “it is hard to figure out how they could conclude that it is not in the national interest.” The report estimated the project would generate about 1,950 annual construction jobs in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas over a two-year period and contribute about 3.4 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product. It would generate about 50 jobs once in operation. In an interview this week, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said members of his labor federation back the project. “We think that anything that’s going to create jobs, help the country and do it in an environmentally sound way ought to be done,” he said. The high-profile decision now enters a new phase, in which Kerry and his deputies will field public comments and internal feedback from eight agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Defense and Energy. The State Department will open a 30-day comment period on Feb. 5, and the agencies will have 90 days to weigh in. After a decision is issued, other agencies have 15 days to object. If one does, the president must decide whether to issue the permit. “It is hard to imagine how the president could justify rejection without turning the United States into a poster child for what the energy industry terms ‘above-ground’ risk,” said Robert McNally, president of the Rapidan Group consulting firm. “I don’t see how logically the president can reject it if he applies the criteria he laid out at Georgetown last year, i.e. whether or not the pipeline would severely exacerbate climate change.” The EPA has questioned whether the State Department has given sufficient weight to the project’s negative environmental impact. The final environmental impact statement notes that bitumen, the substance that is extracted in Canada and diluted in order to be transported to U.S. refineries, is more difficult to clean up than lighter crude if it spills. The report concludes that crude extracted from the oil sands results in 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the average barrel of crude used in the United States but only 2 percent to 10 percent more than the heavy crude it would likely replace at Gulf Coast refineries. The assessment also said that a variety of rail transportation options would result in 28 percent to 42 percent more emissions than the pipeline. The State Department has cited rail as a reason why blocking the pipeline would not slow oil sands development, although a spate of oil train derailments — including a derailment Friday in southeast Mississippi — has highlighted the dangers of that alternative. Now that the State Department has finished its environmental analysis, it has some flexibility on timing. It could issue a decision either before the end of the 105-day agency comment period or long afterward. “Secretary Kerry is just really beginning his involvement in this process,” Jones said. “There is no timeline for his deliberations.” Environmental groups are organizing a “Day of Action” on Tuesday during which they plan to flood Kerry’s office with phone calls and e-mails. “To some extent, Secretary Kerry has gotten a pass to date,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the League of Conservation Voters’ senior vice president for government affairs. “Now that changes. This is a really a pivot point, and this is a real opportunity for him to live up to the climate record he has established through his very accomplished career.” ||||| Environmentalists said they were dismayed at some of the report’s conclusions and disputed its objectivity, but they also said it offered Mr. Obama reasons to reject the pipeline. They said they planned to intensify efforts to try to influence Mr. Kerry’s decision. For more than two years, environmentalists have protested the project and been arrested in demonstrations against it around the country. But many Republicans and oil industry executives, who support the pipeline because they say it creates jobs and increases supplies from a friendly source of oil, embraced the findings. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The State Department is expected to shortly release the results of an inspector general’s investigation into the preparation of an earlier draft of the environmental impact report. The investigation was ordered after an environmental group obtained documents indicating that some consultants for the firm that wrote the draft report had previously done work for TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline. If investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft, the State Department may have to conduct a new environmental review. In light of the investigation, environmentalists were particularly critical of the report released on Friday. “In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor,” said Erich Pica, the president of Friends of the Earth. Some environmentalists saw reason for optimism in the review, which models several possible future oil market possibilities. Most involve a future of high oil prices and robust demand, in which the oil sands crude is rapidly developed with or without the Keystone pipeline. However, the report offers one alternative sequence, in which oil prices and demand are low. In that case, not building the pipeline might slow development, and thus slow carbon emissions. That possibility is unlikely, but it could provide the administration something to point to should it deny the project. “We’re taking the inclusion of that scenario as good news,” said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of international programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The oil industry applauded the review. “After five years and five environmental reviews, time and time again the Department of State analysis has shown that the pipeline is safe for the environment,” said Cindy Schild, the senior manager of refining and oil sands programs at the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry. There are political and strategic advantages to approving the pipeline: It would strengthen relations with Canada and provide a conduit for oil from a friendly neighbor. If the pipeline is approved this year, it could also help the re-election campaigns of two vulnerable Democratic senators from oil-rich states — Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Begich of Alaska — while silencing critics who for years have urged the president to move ahead with the pipeline. Environmentalists said that if Mr. Obama were to approve the pipeline, it would destroy his efforts to make progress on climate change. Thomas F. Steyer, a California hedge fund billionaire and a major donor to Mr. Obama’s presidential campaigns, has started an advocacy group, NextGen Climate Action, that has spent heavily campaigning against the pipeline.

We’re headed in a terribly wrong direction with this project, and I don’t see how that large increase in carbon is going to be offset.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Although the pipeline is a potent political symbol, its true impact on both the environment and the economy would be more limited than either its supporters or its opponents suggest. The new State Department report concludes that the process used for producing the oil — by extracting what are called tar sands or oil sands from the Alberta forest — creates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional oil. But the report concludes that this heavily polluting oil will still be brought to market. Energy companies are already moving the oil out of Canada by rail. “At the end of the day, there’s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,” said Robert McNally, an energy consultant who was a senior energy and economic adviser to President George W. Bush. “It’s less important than I think it was perceived to be a year ago, both politically and on oil markets.” The new State Department analysis took into account the growing global demand for oil and the rapidly growing practice of moving oil by rail in areas where pipelines have not been built. “Given the anticipated outlook of oil prices and the cost of development, no single project will likely affect the rate of extraction,” said a senior State Department official, who asked not to be named under the ground rules imposed by the department. But moving oil by rail has its own hazards. As the practice has increased in recent years, so have incidents of explosions of rail cars carrying oil. Supporters of the pipeline say it will create jobs, though the number may be limited. A study by the Cornell Global Labor Institute concluded that the pipeline would create about 3,900 construction jobs over two years. Privately, people close to Mr. Obama say that although he is committed to building a climate legacy, he does not see the pipeline as a central part of that effort. Instead, the president is moving forward with a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants, the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Those regulations do not have the potent political symbolism of the pipeline, but could have a far greater impact on the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions by freezing construction of new coal plants and closing hundreds of existing ones. Ahead of making his decision, Mr. Kerry will take counsel from the leaders of eight other government agencies: the Departments of Defense, Justice, Interior, Commerce, Transportation, Energy and Homeland Security and the E.P.A. It is unclear when the decision might be made, but some close to the process say it could take as long as a year.

McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “The fact that it’s lasted as long as it has means one of two things. They’ve either done a very good, thorough job, or they’ve slowed it down due to political pressure.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Keystone XL pipeline was a big project that was supposed to carry oil from Canada to the United States through a long and big pipe. However, President Obama didn't allow the pipeline to be built because he was worried about how it might hurt the environment and make the Earth warmer.

We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. When we do that, we get: g = -25 / -5 Now, when we divide a negative number by another negative number, the result is positive.

Characterized by an inability to regulate blood sugar levels, diabetes can lead to severe complications if left untreated. It is essential to be proactive in managing the disease and to consult with a doctor to establish an effective treatment plan. This article will discuss the crucial steps necessary for those with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes to maintain optimal health and prevent complications. 1. Consult with a Doctor When beginning or adjusting your treatment plan, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional specializing in diabetes care. Your doctor can provide valuable information, advice, and resources to help manage your condition, monitor your progress, and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. 2. Seek Immediate Medical Attention for Serious Symptoms If you experience any of the following severe symptoms, seek medical attention immediately: - Difficulty breathing - Fruity-smelling breath (a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA) - Severe abdominal pain - Excessive thirst and frequent urination In severe cases of untreated diabetes, you may be required to stay in the hospital for a short period following your diagnosis. This will allow your healthcare team to monitor your condition closely, administer appropriate treatments, and educate you about ongoing diabetes management. 3. Educate Yourself About Diabetes Understanding diabetes is crucial in effectively managing your condition. Learning about the disease, its symptoms, and treatment options will empower you to take control of your health. Familiarize yourself with essential diabetes-related terms, such as blood glucose, insulin, and A1C, to help you better communicate with your healthcare team. 4. Adhere to Your Medication Regimen Taking your medications as prescribed every day is vital for maintaining proper blood sugar levels. Skipping doses or altering your medication can lead to fluctuations in your blood sugar, making it challenging to manage your diabetes effectively. 5. Consider Insulin Pump Therapy If you require insulin injections, consider discussing insulin pump therapy with your doctor. Insulin pumps offer the convenience of a continuous insulin supply, better blood glucose control, and fewer injections. They may provide an improved quality of life for individuals managing their diabetes. 6. Incorporate Regular Exercise Daily physical activity can significantly improve blood sugar control and overall health for individuals with diabetes. Regular exercise helps increase insulin sensitivity, allowing your body to better utilize glucose. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week, combined with resistance training. 7. Reduce Stress and Implement Coping Strategies Stress can negatively impact blood sugar levels, making stress management essential in controlling diabetes. Utilize various stress reduction techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Additionally, consider joining a diabetes support group to share experiences and coping strategies with others going through similar challenges. 8. Take Measures to Avoid Illness People with diabetes are more vulnerable to infections and other illnesses, as high blood sugar levels can weaken the immune system. Make sure to follow a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and practice good hygiene to prevent sickness. Additionally, ensure you receive all necessary vaccinations, including the annual flu vaccine. 9. Account for Menstruation and Menopause Hormonal changes during menstruation and menopause can significantly impact blood sugar levels. Women with diabetes should discuss these factors with their healthcare team to develop a tailored plan that accounts for hormonal fluctuations and their effects on blood glucose levels. 10. Schedule Regular Check-ups with Your Doctor Regular check-ups with your healthcare team are vital for monitoring your diabetes management and addressing any issues that may arise. These appointments should include a review of your blood sugar levels, medication and insulin regimens, and lifestyle adjustments. Conclusion Living with diabetes requires dedication to a comprehensive treatment plan and a commitment to prioritizing your health. By following the steps outlined in this article and partnering with your healthcare team, you can successfully manage your condition and minimize the risk of complications. Remember, your healthcare team is a valuable resource to rely on in navigating the complexities of diabetes management, and their guidance is crucial in achieving optimal health."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full birth name of the person who was declared the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time? Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

What was the best excuse that a student ever gave for having failed to do something? I would have to say that I was most entertained by a student’s response to “Why are you late for school?” The student said, “I awoke in time this morning but there was a mouse sitting on the edge of my bed. I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.” The following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other. Then when they are assembled before me again, I say, “Thank you gentlemen. I know who did it so you others are free to return to class.” All but one arises and leaves. This works more times than not.

The ceremony held to hand over the house will mark the completion of the school's First-Year Building Project 2008. since 1967, the Yale School of Architecture has offered its first-year graduate students the opportunity to design and build a structure as a part of their education. Unique among architecture schools, this program is compulsory for all members of the class, and students frequently refer to it as their reason for applying to Yale. This year's class of 64 worked to design, develop and document an idea for a 2,100-square-foot, wheelchair-accessible, two-family house. Students had to use sustainable resources and energy-efficient technology. The budget for the project is always less than actual construction costs, and the builders-in-training had to seek supplementary donations, mostly in the form of construction materials. The result this year was a \\"designer\\" home, dressed entirely in cedar , fitted inside with Swedish-designed cabinetry and partially powered by solar energy. The floors are bamboo, another natural material prized for being quickly replenished . This year, the student-builders used a pre-cast foundation system, which, in addition to its other labor-saving virtues, uses 75% less concrete than the poured system. The first-year class of 2008 raised 100,000-worth of donated materials.

A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's think step-by-step and understand the body's response to temperature changes: 1. The premise states that when the body temperature increases, the brain sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. This is a process called vasodilation which helps in dissipating heat from the body. 2. Conversely, when the body temperature decreases, the opposite of vasodilation should occur to conserve heat within the body. This process is called vasoconstriction. 3. Now, in the given situation, Asa's body temperature is decreasing while he is running in a race. Therefore, his body needs to conserve heat. Conclusion: Asa's skin's blood vessels will decrease in diameter due to vasoconstriction to retain heat within the body when his body temperature decreases."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Paracrine signalling mediated by cytokine secretion is essential for liver regeneration after hepatic resection, yet the mechanisms of cellular crosstalk between immune and parenchymal cells are still elusive. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is released by immune cells and mediates strong hepatoprotective functions. However, it remains unclear whether IL-22 is critical for the crosstalk between liver lymphocytes and parenchymal cells during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Here, we found that plasma levels of IL-22 and its upstream cytokine, IL-23, are highly elevated in patients after major liver resection. In a mouse model of PH, deletion of IL-22 was associated with significantly delayed hepatocellular proliferation and an increase of hepatocellular injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Using Rag1(-/-) and Rag2(-/-) γc(-/) (-) mice, we show that the main producers of IL-22 post-PH are conventional natural killer cells and innate lymphoid cells type 1. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a potent danger molecule, is elevated in patients immediately after major liver resection. Antagonism of the P2-type nucleotide receptors, P2X1 and P2Y6, significantly decreased IL-22 secretion ex vivo. In vivo, specific inhibition of P2X1 was associated with decreased IL-22 secretion, elevated liver injury, and impaired liver regeneration.Question: Is p2X1-regulated IL-22 secretion by innate lymphoid cells required for efficient liver regeneration?","completion":"Task: Answer the question based on the information present in the context.

Article: One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation is a blank stare that asks the question, \\"Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?\\" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives?

Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. Palynology, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. Ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-B (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates. Moreover, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change, habitat destruction and species extinction. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can climate changes be determined from soil?","completion":"Climate changes can be determined from soil by examining several aspects, including fossil pollen deposits (palynology), stomatal densities, and leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. Here is a step-by-step explanation: 1. Palynology: By analyzing fossil pollen deposits found in soil sediments, scientists can identify the types of plants that existed in the past and their geographical distribution. This information helps to reconstruct past climates and understand the vegetation changes that have occurred over time. Different plant species thrive in different climates, so their presence or absence in soil samples can give clues to past climate conditions. 2. Stomatal densities: Stomata are small pores on the surface of plant leaves that control the exchange of gases, namely, carbon dioxide and water vapor. The density of stomata can be influenced by atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and studying the stomatal densities in ancient plant remains in soil samples can provide estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations during that time. This information helps to understand past climate changes and their relationship with greenhouse gases. 3. Leaf shapes and sizes: The shape and size of plant leaves can also offer insight into past climate conditions. For example, larger leaves with fewer stomata can be indicative of higher CO2 concentrations and warm climates, while smaller leaves with more stomata may suggest lower CO2 concentrations and cooler climates. By examining fossilized leaves in soil samples, scientists can infer the likely climate conditions during the time when those plants were alive. 4. Plant community ecology and habitat changes: Studying the changes in plant communities in soil samples through time helps to determine how climate change has affected vegetation and habitat. For instance, a shift in dominant plant species or a change in the composition of plant communities could be indicative of shifts in climate conditions, such as increased temperatures or altered precipitation patterns. By integrating all this information from soil samples, scientists can piece together a more comprehensive understanding of how climate changes have impacted ecosystems and how plant species have responded and adapted. This knowledge can aid in predicting future climate change impacts and developing strategies to mitigate potential negative effects on ecosystems and biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

International hip-hop artists warm up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday. \\"Warming up\\" doesn't really capture it; the dancers explode across the stage, each one with a different hip-hop style. Michelle Salazar is chic-grungy in black jeans and white T-shirt, her long black hair swirling around her head.

Here is a detailed breakdown of my assessment: Positive aspects: 1. The reviewer mentions that they have \\"never had an issue,\\" which indicates a smooth and trouble-free experience. This is a positive aspect, implying that the platform or service is reliable and user-friendly. 2. The review states that it is a \\"good way to chat to players from my game.\\" This suggests that the platform succeeds in facilitating communication between players, further enhancing their gaming experience. This feature is valued in online gaming and social platforms. Neutral aspects: 1. The use of the word \\"good\\" is somewhat vague and doesn't provide a clear description of what, specifically, the reviewer likes about the platform or service. The statement \\"It's good\\" could indicate satisfaction but might not represent a strong, enthusiastic endorsement. Negative aspects (considering the rating scale context): While there are no explicit negative statements in the review, the brevity and lack of detail could be considered a drawback. It is challenging to determine which aspects the reviewer is referring to and why they find the service or platform favorable. Overall, I have rated this review as a 4 primarily due to the reviewer's indication of a positive experience without any issues, the mention of good communication among players, and the absence of any negative statements.

Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Answer the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries?","completion":"Given the information provided in the background and situation, the peaches that Mary decided to candy would retain their quality longer than the cherries Ann decided to eat fresh. This reasoning is based on the process of candying fruit, which allows it to retain its quality for a year due to sugar saturation.

You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice.

Alexandru Macedonski (Romanian pronunciation: [alek'sandru matSe'donski]; also rendered as Al. A. Macedonski, Macedonschi or Macedonsky; March 14, 1854 - November 24, 1920) was a Wallachian, later Romanian poet, novelist, dramatist and literary critic, known especially for having promoted French Symbolism in his native country, and for leading the Romanian Symbolist movement during its early decades. A forerunner of local modernist literature, he is the first local author to have used free verse, and claimed by some to have been the first in modern European literature. Within the framework of Romanian literature, Macedonski is seen by critics as second only to national poet Mihai Eminescu; as leader of a cosmopolitan and aestheticist trend formed around his Literatorul journal, he was diametrically opposed to the inward-looking traditionalism of Eminescu and his school. Macedonski also returned with a new volume of poetry, Excelsior (consecutive editions in 1895 and 1896), and founded Liga Ortodoxa (\\"The Orthodox League\\"), a magazine noted for hosting the debut of Tudor Arghezi, later one of the most celebrated figures in Romanian literature. Macedonski commended his new protege for reaching \\"the summit of poetry and art\\" at \\"an age when I was still prattling verses\\". Liga Ortodoxa also hosted articles against Caragiale, which Macedonski signed with the pseudonym Sallustiu (\\"Sallustius\\"). The magazine was additional proof of Macedonski's return to conservatism, and largely dedicated to defending the cause of Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Ghenadie, deposed by the Romanian Synod following a political scandal. It defended Ghenadie up until he chose to resign, and subsequently went out of print. Macedonski was shocked to note that Ghenadie had given up his own defense. In 1895, his Casa cu nr. 10 was translated into French by the Journal des Debats, whose editors reportedly found it picturesque. Two years later, Macedonski himself published French-language translations of his earlier poetry under the title Bronzes, a volume prefaced by his disciple, the critic and promoter Alexandru Bogdan-Pitesti. Although it was positively reviewed by Mercure de France magazine, Bronzes was largely unnoticed by the French audience, a fact which Tudor Vianu attributes to Bogdan-Pitesti's lack of qualification for the cultural mission Macedonski had trusted him with. By that time, his circle had come to be frequented with regularity by Bogdan-Pitesti's friend and collaborator, the celebrated painter Stefan Luchian, who was in the Symbolist and Art Nouveau stage of his career. By 1898, Macedonski was again facing financial difficulties, and his collaborators resorted to organizing a fundraiser in his honor. His rejection of the Orthodox establishment was documented by his political tract, published that year as Falimentul clerului ortodox. Between that time and 1900, he focused on researching esoteric, occult and pseudoscientific subjects. Traian Demetrescu, who recorded his visits with Macedonski, recalled his former mentor being opposed to his positivist take on science, claiming to explain the workings of the Universe in \\"a different way\\", through \\"imagination\\", but also taking an interest in Camille Flammarion's astronomy studies. Macedonski was determined to interpret death through parapsychological means, and, in 1900, conferenced at the Atheneum on the subject Sufletul si viata viitoare (\\"The Soul and the Coming Life\\"). The focal point of his vision was that man could voluntarily stave off death with words and gestures, a concept he elaborated upon in his later articles. In one such piece, Macedonski argued: \\"man has the power [...] to compact the energy currents known as thoughts to the point where he changes them, according to his own will, into objects or soul-bearing creatures.\\" He also attempted to build a machine for extinguishing chimney fires. Later, Nikita Macedonski registered the invention of nacre-treated paper, which is sometimes attributed to his father.

To provide a detailed explanation, let us break down the components of the original statement: 1. \\"More elaboration on this view\\": This phrase refers to a concept or view that needs further clarification or explanation. Since we do not know what view is being referred to, it is assumed that it has been mentioned earlier in the text. 2. \\"can be found in the Novikov self-consistency principle\\": This phrase indicates that the elaboration sought for the view mentioned can be discovered or explained within the framework of the Novikov self-consistency principle. The Novikov self-consistency principle, formulated by Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov in the context of time travel and general relativity, is a hypothesis dealing with the possibility of time travel paradoxes. It proposes that any event leading to a time travel paradox is highly unlikely since the laws of physics prevent inconsistencies. In other words, even if time travel was possible, it would still be constrained by self-consistent causal loops. Suppose the view mentioned in the original statement is related to the potential paradoxes and inconsistencies associated with time travel or the causal structure of spacetime. In that case, the Novikov self-consistency principle is indeed a concept that provides more elaborate insights into that view. Through its framework, it can help address paradoxical questions and ensure that the conclusions deduced from the view maintain coherence with our understanding of the natural world.

The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.

Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.

Plot title: Tinker Bell Movie plot: Tinker Bell (Mae Whitman) is born from the first laugh of a baby, and is brought by the winds to Pixie Hollow (which is part of the island of Never Land). She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working, she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu), a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-SymonÃ©), a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns, she tries to explain, but Mary simply responds that she knows, and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions. On the beach, Tinker Bell finds parts of a music box and figures out how to put them together. Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, and Rosetta witness her doing this, then tell her that she was tinkering and that she should be proud of her talentâif this is what she's good at, the mainland should not matter.

Initially, Tinker Bell is desperate to join the nature-talent fairies on the mainland, but her attempts to learn their skills fail miserably. This causes Tinker Bell to feel frustrated and unhappy with her own abilities. However, as the movie plot demonstrates, it is important for Tinker Bell to accept and be proud of her gifts as a tinker fairy. Throughout the story, she discovers that her talent for fixing and creating things is remarkable and valuable in its own right. As Tinker Bell builds friendships with fairies of different talents, she learns that each talent is vital for maintaining a balance in the magical world. To truly solve her problems, Tinker Bell must find a way to channel her exceptional tinkering skills into helping others and contributing to the well-being of Pixie Hollow. By doing so, she will not only gain the respect and support of her fellow fairies but also demonstrate that every fairy's talent is essential regardless of whether they directly involve visiting the mainland or not. In the end, it is Tinker Bell's journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and perseverance that will allow her to overcome her challenges and realize the importance of her own unique contributions to the magical world. By embracing her talents and using them for good, Tinker Bell will grow into a confident and valued member of the fairy community, proving that the key to solving her problems lies within herself and her ability to adapt and grow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cooling occurs happens, how will it affect LESS power produced by the steam engine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more cooling occurring will have an effect on the process of the steam engine, resulting in less power being produced. If there is more cooling happening, the steam produced from heating the water in the tank will lose some of its energy as it loses heat to the surrounding environment. This results in a decrease in the steam pressure and the energy it can transfer to the piston. When the steam has less energy, it will not be able to push the piston as effectively. Consequently, the movement of the crankshaft will be affected, leading to a decrease in the output power of the steam engine. This direct effect of increased cooling causing less power to be produced ultimately reflects the perturbation's impact on the overall steam engine process. To counteract this issue, it may be necessary to improve the insulation around the steam piping system or increase the amount of heat generated within the boiler to maintain a higher steam pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At a time when the spread of surveillance tech is stoking controversy, I decided to install an app-controlled internet camera in my flat. The gadget allowed me to look and listen in to my fiancee and pet cat's living-room activities at any time, and would send me an alert if it detected movement or noise I might be interested in. A night-vision mode meant the dark offered no respite, and just in case I missed anything there was also the opportunity to review and download a time-lapse clip of recent events. Paula, my partner, was rather nonplussed by the development. \\"It's the devil's work,\\" she declared on being introduced to the kit. \\"I don't like this, I feel like I'm on Big Brother. I can't pick my nose anymore.\\" Explaining the experiment to others also raised issues. My brother asked if we were indulging in some twisted PornHub fantasy, and even my tech-savvy work colleagues struggled to see the appeal. But I was curious: would getting increased access to Paula and Miggy's private lives over a two-week period make us closer, or just prove a creep-out? Things did not get off to an auspicious start. The unit I was testing - the Withings Home - is deliberately designed to blend in, meaning it is easy to forget it is there. This almost caused a prenuptial catastrophe. On the first morning of our experiment, I was woken by a notification that prompted me to watch a brief video of an activity the camera had just captured. It showed Paula unpacking her wedding dress for a quick twirl while she thought I was still dozing. Luck alone meant the clip cut out before the bridal gown swung into full view. After revealing this, my Brazilian partner became hugely self-conscious of the lounge-based \\"intruder\\". Over the course of the rest of the weekend, she made and received calls to her family in other rooms of the flat even though I do not speak Portuguese, so would not benefit from listening in. What surprised me was how briefly this transition period lasted before her behaviour returned to normal. A few ground rules probably helped. Top of the list: no lurking in a remote location without revealing that I was connected. This was relatively easy to achieve because I could talk through the camera's on-board speaker via an associated tablet and smartphone app to flag my presence. It also helped that it soon became clear the main attraction, for both Paula and me, was watching our housebound pet - both via a high-definition live stream and a compressed recap of his activities at the end of the day. Logging in for feline feeds, it turns out, is not only addictive but feels substantially less shameful than doing the same to a human. But that is not to say it was a guilt-free experience. In my imagination, during our long hours away from home, Miggy would stroll round the flat, play with his toys, scratch his post and generally engage in an elaborate domestic exercise programme. What we discovered was that after staring at the window for a few minutes to see if we would return, he would slump on to the sofa and remain there for 15 hours or more. As a result I now make more of a fuss of him when we are in. But the discovery that he lets out three short, sharp, cute mews when he hears us at the front door hardly makes up for the fact I am now struck by pangs of conscience every time I go out. There were benefits to the system. Discovering that Paula had held up an \\"I love you\\" sign to the camera while I was at the gym was particularly heart-warming. The camera also proved useful when we went away for a long weekend and could see that our neighbours had repeatedly popped in to keep Miggy company, although in retrospect we should have warned them of the gadget's existence in advance. But there was more than a modicum of relief when I unplugged the camera and put it away for the last time. The Home, and competing devices including Google's Dropcam, Netatmo's Welcome and Xiaomi's Yi Smart, are marketed as ways to help parents keep an eye on their children, and families as a whole capture memories that would otherwise be lost. The companies also suggest that owning such kit acts as a deterrent to thieves whose images would be stored online, even if they took the cameras as part of their haul. When I quizzed Withings' brand manager Lucie Broto about her product, she suggested that even pets could benefit. She suggested speaking to my cat while I was out to entertain him. I suspect my disembodied voice would be more likely to freak him out. More telling was her revelation, when pressed, that her boyfriend often turns their copy of the Home to face the wall or even unplugs it when he is at home alone in their Paris apartment. After a fortnight of being put under the internet's equivalent of the microscope, the last word deservedly goes to Paula: \\"These things need to have a purpose. For security you could set up an alarm at the door. \\"It seems to me they're more about having control over other people in the house. \\"One of the ads they use shows a little kid holding up a drawing to the camera, but in reality it will be about the parents checking when their children came home and if they did their homework. Or jealous boyfriends checking what their other half is doing. \\"It's an intrusion of privacy, I felt like someone had bugged our home.\\" This article was about:","completion":"The article is about the author's personal experience installing an app-controlled internet camera in their home and how it affected their relationship with their partner and pet cat.

Kobayashi's plane malfunctions and is forced to land near Iwato Island, an uninhabited strip of rocks formed by volcanic eruptions. Tsukioka then looks for Kobayashi and finds him safe, with only a wrist sprain. While talking, the two men hear some strange sounds and find two monsters fighting. Tsukioka immediately recognizes one of the monsters to be Godzilla. The two monsters then fall off a cliff, into the ocean. Tsukioka and Kobayashi report to the authorities in Osaka, and find out that the other monster Godzilla was fighting is Anguirus. A group of scientists with the two pilots research Anguirus in a book written by a Polish scientist. Godzilla and Anguirus lived around the same time millions of years ago, and there was an intense rivalry between the two monsters. Archaeologist Kyohei Yamane, who experienced Godzilla's attack in 1954, is also present at the meeting, and shows a film (composed of clips from the 1954 film) of the original Godzilla attacking Tokyo. He confirms that this Godzilla is a second member of the same species, and that it and Anguirus were probably brought back to life by the same hydrogen bomb tests that awoke the original Godzilla. Yamane states that there is no way to kill Godzilla, and that Daisuke Serizawa, the inventor of the Oxygen Destroyer, had died and burned the formula. Yamane, though, suggests that the military should use flares on Godzilla to attract the monster away from the shore as Godzilla becomes angry when it sees lights because the hydrogen bomb's bright explosion had awakened and mutated it. Godzilla arrives on the shore of Osaka. While a blackout of all city lights is enforced, JASDF jets are sent to shoot flares from their planes to lead Godzilla away from the shore.

Q:Given the below context: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It's a completely unique urban piece, where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much.

Choices: - surface plants - dry plants - bacterial plants - aquatic plants A: A:","completion":"Aquatic plants Step 1: Analyzing the choices - Surface plants: There isn't a specific category called surface plants in botanical classification. - Dry plants: In dry conditions, plants tend to develop deep roots to reach water sources, so it's unlikely that they won't require deep roots. - Bacterial plants: Bacteria aren't classified as plants. - Aquatic plants: These plants live in water or watery environments, which means they can absorb water easily without needing deep roots. Step 2: Identifying the best answer Aquatic plants typically do not require deep roots or woody stems because they can easily absorb water and nutrients present in their environment. Their supportive structures come from the buoyancy of the water, which means there's no need for strong woody stems to keep them upright.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Sydney?\\", is \\"fit\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"Based on the limited context available about Sydney's dietary choices, providing an accurate and valid description of Sydney being \\"fit\\" cannot be solely determined. While it can be observed that Sydney preferred fries over vegetables in this instance, there are numerous other factors to consider when describing someone's fitness level. It's necessary to consider not only dietary habits but also their lifestyle choices and activities. Some people may occasionally prefer non-healthy food options, like fries, but still maintain an overall balanced and healthy diet. Additionally, some individuals engage in regular physical activity, or have a job that requires high physical demands, which could maintain their fitness level despite their occasional indulgence in unhealthy foods. It’s also important to look at the consumption of other food groups, such as proteins, fruits, and dairy, to evaluate the overall balance of Sydney’s diet. As we cannot solely rely on the given statement about Sydney's choice of fries over vegetables, other factors that determine fitness would be helpful to evaluate. These may include an assessment of their body composition, overall exercise routine, cardiovascular health, flexibility, muscular strength, and endurance. Moreover, an individual's mental well-being, stress management, and quality of sleep also influence their overall fitness. Before making a judgment on Sydney's fitness, it is essential to consider a more comprehensive insight into her lifestyle, physical activity levels, dietary habits, and overall health parameters.

The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\\" “I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,” Hannity said.

Q:Background: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition. Paragraph: Pete and Mike were two brothers. Pete had no health problems, while Mike inherited the sickle cell trait. Mike had adjacent health problems. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother didn't have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate? A:","completion":"The brother who didn't have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate is Pete. In the described scenario, it's mentioned that Pete had no health problems. On the other hand, Mike, his brother, inherited the sickle cell trait. This means Mike had a mutation in the primary sequence of his hemoglobin molecules causing them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of his red blood cells. This aggregation is typical of sickle cell disease or trait. But since it's stated that Mike inherited only the sickle cell trait, not the disease, and that the sickle cell trait is usually not life-threatening, it suggests that Mike might only have some of his hemoglobin as hemoglobin S (formed due to the mutation). The trait or disease is due to a specific genetic abnormality that causes the hemoglobin molecules to behave differently, causing them to stick together or 'aggregate'. However, only individuals who inherit this abnormal gene from their parents will display the noted effects - either they will have the sickle cell trait if they inherit from one parent or sickle cell disease if inherited from both. In Pete's case, since he does not have any health problems as described in the scenario, it can be inferred that he did not inherit this mutated gene from his parents, and therefore his hemoglobin molecules do not aggregate. Thus, Pete is the brother who did not have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Put candle in cold water to soften wax.. Answer:","completion":"The best way to fit a candle into a smaller candle holder is by following these steps: Step 1: Assess the situation. Determine how much smaller the candle holder is compared to the candle that needs to be inserted. Step 2: Choose the appropriate method. Between the given options (I) and (II), the correct method to soften the wax would be (I). Put the candle in hot water to soften the wax. Cold water would not cause the wax to soften, as it generally makes materials more rigid. Step 3: Heat water in a container large enough to immerse the base of the candle. The water should not be boiling, but it should be hot to the touch. To avoid damaging the candle or affecting its integrity, refrain from immersing the entire candle. Step 4: Dip the base of the candle into the hot water. Hold it there for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the wax has softened noticeably. Step 5: Carefully remove the candle from the hot water and gently shape the softened base to fit the smaller candle holder. This can be done with your fingers, but make sure to be cautious to avoid causing burns or damaging the candle. Step 6: Once the candle base has been shaped to fit the candle holder, place the candle into the holder and ensure it is securely in place. If additional adjustments are needed, repeat steps 3-5 until the candle securely fits into the candle holder. Step 7: Allow the wax to cool and harden in its new shape, securing the candle in the candle holder. In conclusion, the best way to fit a candle into a smaller candle holder is by using hot water (option I) to soften the base of the candle and then reshaping it to fit the particular holder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil. Question: suppose water has less salt in it happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: no effect The process of fossilization depends primarily on the rapid burial of the dead organism and the presence of minerals dissolved in the water rather than the salinity (salt content) of the water. Reducing the salt content would still allow for dissolved minerals to be present and continue the process of fossilization. Water plays a role in the transportation of minerals to the remains and the formation of crystals, which ultimately helps in turning the remains into fossils. If the remains are exposed to the water containing dissolved minerals, regardless of the salt content, the minerals can form crystals and cause the remains to harden, eventually leading to fossil formation. In summary, the salt content of the water does not play a significant role in the formation of fossils. Instead, the crucial factors are the rapid burial of the organism, the availability of dissolved minerals in the water, and the right environmental conditions. As a result, even if water has less salt in it, it will not affect the number of fossils forming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Use the following highlights to write an article: More bookmakers 'lead to increased policing and health costs' Some areas of London have eight bookies on a single street. Article:","completion":"Title: The Consequences of Growing Bookmaker Density in London: Policing and Health Costs on the Rise Introduction In recent years, London has experienced a significant increase in the number of bookmakers setting up shop, with some areas boasting as many as eight bookies operating on a single street. This surge in betting establishments is causing various social and economic concerns, leading to increased policing and health costs for local communities. In this article, we will examine the impacts of this trend on London's neighborhoods and discuss the need for more regulation and support systems to mitigate these problems. The link between bookmakers and crime The presence of a high number of gambling establishments tends to attract criminal activities, from drug dealing to theft and anti-social behavior. In particular, areas with a dense concentration of bookmakers are becoming hotspots for criminal activity, prompting law enforcement agencies to invest more resources into patrolling these areas to ensure public safety. The rise in policing costs is a significant burden on local taxpayers, who are essentially funding the increased law enforcement presence required to counter the negative effects of high bookmaker density. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of criminal activity in these areas makes them less desirable places to live or operate businesses, leading to reduced property values and a decline in the vibrancy of local communities. Public health concerns The prevalence of bookmakers has also contributed to growing public health concerns. Problem gambling is a serious issue that affects both individuals and their families, causing financial hardship, relationship difficulties, and mental health problems. Areas with a high concentration of bookies are seeing a rise in problem gambling incidences, placing a strain on local healthcare services and support networks. Moreover, the reliance on gambling as a source of income or entertainment may lead to the development of addictive behavior patterns, further exacerbating the negative impact on public health. In turn, this increases healthcare costs as individuals affected by gambling addiction and their families require ongoing support, treatment, and counseling to deal with the consequences. Potential solutions and the need for more regulation Given the adverse effects of high bookmaker density on crime and public health, there is a pressing need for major cities like London to tighten their gambling regulations. This may include the imposition of stricter licensing requirements and zoning laws to limit the number of bookmakers allowed within a specific area, thus reducing the concentration of betting establishments and their associated problems. Moreover, awareness campaigns highlighting the risks of problem gambling and the importance of responsible gambling practices should be promoted in areas with high bookmaker presence. This can help minimize the potential harm to individuals at risk of developing gambling addictions. Additionally, local authorities and law enforcement agencies could benefit from working closely with bookmakers to address crime and safety concerns associated with gambling premises. This may involve collaborative efforts to share information and implement measures aimed at reducing the possibility of criminal activity in the vicinity of betting establishments. Conclusion The growing number of bookmakers in London is causing a strain on both the police and local healthcare services, resulting in increased costs and reduced quality of life for communities affected by high bookie density. To combat these issues, it is vital for cities like London to implement stricter regulations on gambling establishments and work collaboratively with bookmakers to create a safer environment free from crime and addiction. By addressing the root causes of these problems, urban centers can protect the well-being of their residents and maintain the vibrancy and health of their communities."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Gaul (Latin: Gallia) was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of . According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. Roman control of Gaul lasted for five centuries, until the last Roman rump state, the Domain of Soissons, fell to the Franks in AD 486. While the Celtic Gauls had lost their original identities and language during Late Antiquity, becoming amalgamated into a Gallo-Roman culture, \\"Gallia\\" remained the conventional name of the territory throughout the Early Middle Ages, until it acquired a new identity as the Capetian Kingdom of France in the high medieval period. \\"Gallia\\" remains a name of France in modern Greek (Γαλλία) and modern Latin (besides the alternatives \\"Francia\\" and \\"Francogallia\\"). 1. according to a Roman Emperor how many parts in Gaul? 2. are they named? 3. what was the emperor called? 4. what is the latin translation for it? 5. who lived there in an era named after metal? 6. how many countries did it cover? 7. can you list three of them? 8. in what year AD was is conquered? 9. by who? 10. when did Caesar complete his conquest?","completion":"1.

Available options: +yes; +it is not possible to tell; +no;","completion":"Based on the premise provided, the hypothesis \\"Getting drunk drivers off the road could save lives\\" is indeed true. The statement acknowledges that police could save a few hundred lives if they manage to get a large fraction of drunken drivers off the road. The correlation between getting drunken drivers off the road and the potential saving of lives is clear in this case. Drunk driving is a well-known and significant problem around the world. It poses a threat to the safety and well-being of both the intoxicated drivers themselves and others on the road. When individuals drive under the influence of alcohol, they typically experience impaired judgment, slower reaction time, and weakened motor skills, all of which can be detrimental to their ability to drive safely. This increases the risks of road accidents, which may result in property damage, injuries, or even fatalities. By getting drunk drivers off the road, law enforcement officers can reduce the number of incidents involving impaired drivers. This can directly lead to a decrease in the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities caused by drunk driving. As such, the hypothesis that \\"Getting drunk drivers off the road could save lives\\" is true. Furthermore, various strategies have been implemented around the world to address this issue. These efforts include public awareness campaigns, stricter laws and penalties, sobriety checkpoints, and the use of ignition interlock devices for repeat offenders, among others. These measures are aimed at deterring people from engaging in drunk driving, identifying those who do, and mitigating the risks posed by intoxicated drivers. Though it is challenging to eliminate drunk driving altogether, such strategies can substantially reduce the incidence of impaired driving and consequently save lives. In conclusion, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"Getting drunk drivers off the road could save lives\\" is true. By minimizing the occurrence of driving under the influence and apprehending drivers who engage in such behavior, law enforcement officers can contribute to a safer environment on the roads and save lives.

Answer based on context: Spanish Town is the site of an early cast-iron bridge, designed by Thomas Wilson and manufactured by Walker and Company of Rotherham, England. Spanning the Rio Cobre, the bridge was erected in 1801 at a cost of £4,000. Its four arched ribs are supported on massive masonry abutments. After the abutments deteriorated, endangering the structure, it was listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. A restoration project began in 2004, with funding provided by American Express through World Monuments Fund. Progress was slow until 2008, when a renewed restoration effort was made. A first phase of restoration was completed in April 2010, when the repair of the abutments allowed the bridge to be reopened for the public.

Das Kollegium wird meinen Vorschlag, eine gezielte Maßnahme anzunehmen, um spezielle Warnhinweise auf magnetischen Spielzeugen zu fordern, in Betracht ziehen. Das würde die Lücke schließen, bis es für dieses Risiko entsprechende Normen gibt. Translate to English English:","completion":"The faculty will consider my proposal to adopt a targeted measure calling for special warning labels on magnetic toys. This would close the gap until there are appropriate standards for this risk. The issue regarding the presence of small-sized magnets in toys is well documented and has become a subject of concern among parents and educators due to the potential hazards these small magnets pose to the health and safety of children. In recent years, several incidents have been reported where children have accidentally ingested small magnets, leading to severe health complications that have sometimes resulted in surgery or even death. It is understandable that the faculty would consider a proposal to adopt a targeted measure, such as requiring special warning labels on magnetic toys. This could help to inform parents and caregivers about the potential risks associated with these toys, allowing them to make more informed decisions when purchasing or allowing their children to play with them. The implementation of special warning labels on magnetic toys has the potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents involving magnet ingestion and other related injuries. These labels could serve as a clear and visible reminder of the inherent risks associated with these toys, prompting parents and caregivers to exercise greater caution when supervising children during play. In the absence of existing standards specifically addressing the risks posed by magnetic toys, the adoption of a targeted warning label measure could be considered a necessary and appropriate response. However, this should be seen as only an interim solution, with the ultimate goal being the development and implementation of comprehensive industry standards for magnetic toys that effectively mitigate all associated risks. In order for these proposed warning labels to be truly effective, they must be designed in a clear and easily understandable format, using simple language and universally recognized symbols to convey the intended message. Moreover, the warnings should be prominently displayed on the toy packaging and the toys themselves, ensuring maximum visibility and impact. It is also critical that the implementation of warning labels on magnetic toys is accompanied by comprehensive public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives aimed at further promoting the safe use and handling of these toys. This could involve working closely with schools, community organizations, and healthcare providers to disseminate vital information about the potential hazards of magnetic toys and the importance of vigilance in preventing accidental ingestion and injuries. In conclusion, the adoption of the targeted measure to require special warning labels on magnetic toys is an important step towards ensuring the safety and well-being of children who may come into contact with these potentially hazardous products. This measure, however, should be considered as a temporary solution until more extensive and comprehensive industry standards are developed to regulate and control the inherent risks. The focus should also be extended to include public education and awareness campaigns to achieve maximum impact and to truly make a difference in reducing the dangers associated with magnetic toys, safeguarding our children's health and wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who meet with a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization? from the following article ? Samir Horn is an Arabic-speaking Sudanese-American and devout Muslim. His Sudanese father was killed by a car bomb when he was a child. As an adult, Samir is first seen operating as an arms dealer. While negotiating a deal with Omar in Yemen he is arrested and thrown into a Yemeni jail. Later, Samir and Omar become friends, and when Omar's people arrange an escape, they take Samir with them. They meet Fareed, a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization. FBI Special Agent Roy Clayton suspects Samir has been radicalized and begins tracking him. Joining al-Nathir, Samir uses the skills he learned as a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant with the U.S. Army Special Forces to bomb the U.S. consulate in Nice, France. It is revealed that Samir is working under deep cover for a US intelligence contractor, Carter; Samir is devastated when he learns that despite Carter's covert efforts, innocent people perished in the consulate bombing. Impressed with Samir, Fareed introduces him to leader Nathir, who discloses a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the U.S. during Thanksgiving and instructs Samir to act as liaison to each of the al-Nathir sleeper bombers. Later, Carter unwittingly interrupts a meeting between Samir and Omar, and is killed by Omar. Samir reveals his deep cover to Agent Clayton, who tracks him to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. While on board a cargo ship to Marseille, France, Samir kills Nathir and Fareed, and tells an enraged Omar that by targeting innocents they betrayed Islam. Samir then tells Omar that he switched the bombers' emails and placed them all on the same bus, so all of them died without victims (except for the driver of the one bus). The Canadian police and the FBI break in, kill Omar, and injure Samir. Answer:","completion":"The first names of the people who meet with a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization are Samir and Omar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They have been a popular form of entertainment for centuries and were especially prevalent in broadsheets during the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe. Broadsheets were large sheets of paper commonly used for printing purposes, particularly for newspapers and magazines. These printed materials often contained various forms of information, from news articles to visual materials such as illustrations and prints. The term \\"cartoon\\" has its origins in the Italian word \\"cartone,\\" which means a large sheet of paper or cardboard, used traditionally by artists for sketching preliminary drawings to be later transferred onto a final surface, such as a canvas or wall for a painting or fresco. In the early centuries, these cartoons were not yet associated with humor but were usually satirical or critical illustrations of socio-political events or public figures. It was not until 1843 that the term \\"cartoon\\" started to be used to describe humorous single-panel illustrations, specifically in the context of gag cartoons. This first usage was documented in the British humor magazine Punch, which was published between 1841 and 2002 and played a significant role in shaping and popularizing the comic genre in both Britain and internationally. Punch was known for its range of humorous illustrations and caricatures that offered satirical commentaries on contemporary life, politics, and society. The evolution of the term \\"cartoon\\" to encompass gag single-panel illustrations is an important part of the history of visual entertainment and humor, and it highlights how language and terminology adapt to changing cultural practices and the development of various art forms. Therefore, understanding that the term \\"cartoon\\" began to be associated with gag single-panel illustrations in 1843 allows us to gain a better grasp of the origins of the modern-day comic and animation industries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: In Europe many people died during the Second World War. As a result, at the end of the war there were many orphans there. A man called Hermann Gmeiner wanted to help these children. His idea was simple. He wanted orphans to have a home, and he wanted them to have the care and kindness of parents. Gmeiner asked people to give him some money. With this money he built the first SOS Children's Village at Imst, in Austria. It opened in1949. This is how the SOS stand for \\"Save Our Souls .\\" This means \\"Please help us!\\" An SOS Children' village gives help to orphans. Hermann Gmeiner's idea for helping orphans soon spread all over the world. By 1983 there were 170 SOS Children's Villages in the world. People in many countries give money to help the villages. Today the children from the first village have grown up. Now some of them work in other SOS Children's Villages. In SOS Villages orphans live in family groups. There are several houses in each village. The biggest village has 40 or 50 houses! Between seven and ten children live in a house. A woman lives with each group of children and looks after them. She gives the children a lot of love and kindness. She cooks meals for them and makes comfortable, happy home for them. Of course, the children don't spend all their time in the village. They go to school, they go out with their friends. But the village gives them a home--sometimes for the first time in their lives.

Answer based on context: Coming off their divisional home win over the Bengals, head coach John Harbaugh and the Ravens stayed at home for a Week 12 interconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers and their head coach (John's brother) Jim Harbaugh, on Thanksgiving. (The game was jokingly nicknamed \\"The Harbaugh Bowl.\\") Baltimore delivered the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 39-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff, but the 49ers answered with kicker David Akers getting a 45-yard field goal. The Ravens regained the lead in the second quarter with a 23-yard field goal from Cundiff. San Francisco began the third quarter with Akers nailing a 52-yard field goal, yet Baltimore regained the lead in the fourth quarter with quarterback Joe Flacco finding tight end Dennis Pitta on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 39-yard field goal from Cundiff. Afterwards, the defense would hold to prevent any comeback attempt from the 49ers. Linebacker Terrell Suggs (3 tackles, 3 sacks, & 1 forced fumble) was named NFL Network's Puddin' Pie Award winner. How many is the difference in the yards of the first field goal made by Cundiff and the yards in the first field goal made by Akers?","completion":"To find the difference in yards of the first field goals made by both kickers, we need to subtract the yards of Billy Cundiff's field goal from the yards of David Akers' field goal. Billy Cundiff made his first field goal from 39 yards out, while David Akers made his from 45 yards out. Calculation: 45 yards (Akers) - 39 yards (Cundiff) = 6 yards.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Immediately, John probably will clearly learn French perfectly. OPTIONS: 1. unacceptable. 2. acceptable.","completion":"1. unacceptable. The sentence \\"Immediately, John probably will clearly learn French perfectly.\\" may convey the intended meaning but is not linguistically acceptable due to several issues with the adverb placement and overuse of adverbs. In the sentence, there are five adverbs: \\"immediately,\\" \\"probably,\\" \\"clearly,\\" \\"perfectly,\\" and \\"learn\\" (which functions as an adverb because of its -ly form). Not only does this make the sentence sound clumsy, but the adverb placement also makes it less clear and difficult to understand. Let's break down the sentence and analyze it further: 1. \\"Immediately\\": This adverb suggests that learning French occurs with no delay. In the sentence, it is unclear whether \\"immediately\\" modifies \\"will learn\\" or another adverb, which confuses the reader. 2. \\"Probably\\": This adverb is used to express uncertainty or likelihood. It appears between the subject (\\"John\\") and the statement (\\"will clearly learn French perfectly\\"), which makes it unclear whether John himself being tentative or the speaker is uncertain about the effectiveness of his learning process. 3. \\"Clearly\\": This adverb indicates the clarity or precision in which something is done. However, its placement before \\"learn\\" seems awkward and doesn't contribute to the overall meaning. 4. \\"Perfectly\\": This adverb suggests that the way John learns French is flawless or ideal. Its placement after \\"French\\" is acceptable but may be more effective elsewhere in the sentence. To make the sentence linguistically acceptable, we can reorder and reduce the number of adverbs. A better alternative would be: \\"John will probably learn French perfectly and immediately.\\" In this revised version, \\"probably\\" modifies the entire verb phrase \\"learn French perfectly and immediately,\\" while \\"perfectly\\" maintains its position next to the object \\"French.\\" The adverb \\"clearly\\" has been removed as it seemed redundant.

If the annulus fibrosus is torn, how easily does the inner material 'leak out'?\\" Shampoo is making hair soft and thin. Is it better to apply Shikakai to get thick hair? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: [I] no [II] yes","completion":"[I] no The two questions are not paraphrases of each other as they address different subjects and concerns. The first question focuses on the composition and properties of the materials within a spinal disc, while the second question is about hair care and the impact of shampoo and shikakai on hair thickness. Regarding the first question, a spinal disc is an essential component of the human spine, located between vertebrae and serving as a shock absorber and facilitator of movement. It features an outer ring, called the annulus fibrosus, and an inner core, called the nucleus pulposus. The consistency of the material inside the spinal disc, particularly the nucleus pulposus, varies with age. In younger individuals, it is gelatinous and highly hydrated. As one ages, the composition changes, and it becomes more fibrous and less hydrated. Its thickness is also variable depending on factors such as age, hydration, and overall spinal health. If the annulus fibrosus becomes torn or injured, the inner material (nucleus pulposus) may 'leak out' or be extruded into the spinal canal. The ease with which this material 'leaks out' depends on the severity of the tear and the overall condition of the spinal disc. In some cases, only a small amount of the inner material might be extruded, while in more severe cases, a significant portion of the nucleus pulposus could herniate into the spinal canal, potentially causing pain and functionality issues. The second question concerns hair care and the use of shampoo, which often contains chemicals that can make hair feel softer and thinner, compared to the use of natural substances like shikakai. Shikakai, derived from the Acacia concinna tree, is traditionally used in Indian hair care routines due to its natural cleansing, conditioning, and nourishing properties. Using shikakai instead of shampoo is believed to promote thicker, healthier hair by imparting important nutrients that promote healthy hair growth. In summary, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first query delves into the structural composition of spinal discs and the potential consequences of disc damage, while the second question examines hair care and the use of natural alternatives for maintaining hair thickness and health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Anyone with a young boy in the house who won't watch black & white movies should put this on their television set. When the child walks by, wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting's about, tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn't big enough to watch it yet. That'll hold him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will keep him to the end. I think my father did that to me, anyway, and I'm the better man for it. This classic adventure yarn, set in India during the British occupation, features a trio of Army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart. Help arrives in the form of a vicious Thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against. \\"Gunga Din\\" was one of the great movies to come out of Hollywood's finest year, 1939. Even more than most great movies from that Golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. The theme music is instant hummable nirvana. While shot in California, the camera work (the only thing in \\"Gunga Din\\" that got so much as an Oscar nomination) has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the Raj of a hundred years before. The battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner, not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real, not staged like some Cecil B. DeMille Biblical slaughter fest. The script doesn't just set up action scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor. The main focus is on Sgt. Cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. It's a rare actioner for Cary Grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense. Anchoring the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who dotes over his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own hare-brained schemes. He's just as funny in his own way, leaving Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., displaying some nice Errol Flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up. If \\"Gunga Din\\" was a Lifetime movie, it would be about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks. But since it's a guys' film, the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as Cutter indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too. The political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much for the gender issue but the idea of British soldiers saving poor Indians from the vicious Thuggies. It reeks of colonial apologia. Thankfully, this film was made back when, and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of derring-do and false racial pride, have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval. After all, for all their swashbuckling glory, the film's true sacrifice involves the title character, played so heart-wrenchingly by Sam Jaffe. Back when this film was made, movie mogul Jack Warner had a saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Still, it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in \\"Gunga Din.\\" I watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what Gunga Din was really up to when he led Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really plotting revenge against his British overlords? Would he have been justified in doing so, especially given MacChesney's cold treatment of him? When Col. Weed delivers that eulogy, the poem by Rudyard Kipling on which the film is loosely based, was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism's folly, of lording it over someone who proved \\"a better man than I am\\" in the end? What did they make of the Guru's great speech, delivered in perfect clipped English: \\"You have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith, which is your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as readily as you...India, farewell.\\" Of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: \\"Kill for the love of killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill!\\" Which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the British, and save the questions about what it all means for later. What \\"Gunga Din\\" means to me, most of all, is the quickest, surest 90-minute thrill ride on video. Cutter never found his golden temple, but there's one for all of us watching \\"Gunga Din.\\"","completion":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Moreover, it is further suggested by Sullum that this mistake clouds the judgment and damages the credibility of reporters and commentators who aspire to skepticism but too often settle for reflexive disbelief. The context implies a critical view of how journalists have been reporting on Donald Trump, finding faults in their inclination to dismiss his statements as dishonest, even when they might be debatable. Sullum points out that it is important for journalists to maintain skepticism, but they should not automatically resort to disbelief, since it could be damaging to their credibility in the long run.

Todas las enseñanzas y los gestos de Jesús subrayan la importancia y la dignidad inalienable de cada individuo, independientemente de su edad, género, status social o nivel de educación. Como sabemos, Jesús durante su tiempo en la Tierra, mostró un amor especial hacia los niños. Hay numerosas situaciones en las Escrituras donde Jesús daba la bienvenida a los niños, los bendecía e incluso se refería a ellos como ejemplos de lo que el reino de los cielos significaba. Un amor tan profundo que incluso en Mateo 18:10, Jesús advierte serio contra aquellos que desprecian o inducen a pecar a los pequeños. Además, Jesus destacó la importancia de la personalidad humana. Este es un concepto que puede entenderse como el conjunto de características o cualidades que definen a una persona. Él resaltó el valor de cada individuo, viendo más allá de las apariencias externas y enfocándose en el corazón y el alma de las personas.

The design and size of a satellite has no direct correlation to the grape crushing or washing processes in wine-making. The steps needed for making wine such as growing, gathering, washing, removing the stems, crushing grapes, and fermenting them with yeast will not undergo a change due to alteration in satellite. Satellites could be used for monitoring meteorological conditions and potentially assist with determining optimal times for various stages of grape cultivation, but they do not have any direct impact on the physical actions of crushing or washing grapes.

They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving.

Choices: [I] no [II] yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answers to these two questions would essentially be the same, as they both ask about the experience of having sex for the first time. Both are inquiring about the feelings, emotions, and sensations associated with this initial intimate encounter. When it comes to describing what it is like to have sex for the first time, it is essential to recognize that every individual's experience may differ significantly based on various factors, including age, emotions, physical sensations, and cultural background. However, there are some common themes which can be used to describe the general experience of having first time sex. As a detailed and long answer, the following elements typically describe the experience of having sex for the first time: 1. Nervousness and Anxiety: It is normal for individuals to feel nervous or anxious about having sex for the first time, as it is a new, unfamiliar, and intimate experience. Various concerns may arise, such as performance anxiety, fear of pain, or worry about unwanted consequences. While these feelings can be quite overwhelming, communication and trust between partners can alleviate some of these anxieties. 2. Emotional Connection: Sharing such an intimate moment with another person has the potential to deepen the emotional bond between partners. Expressing love, affection, or trust during the first sexual encounter may strengthen feelings of closeness and attachment. 3. Physical Sensations: Engaging in sexual activity for the first time can involve a mix of physical sensations, both pleasurable and uncomfortable. The body may respond differently initially as it adapts to new sensations, including genital touch and penetration, which could result in some discomfort. However, some individuals might experience arousal and pleasure. It's important to openly communicate these sensations with one's partner to ensure comfort and consent throughout the experience. 4. Expectations vs. Reality: The first sexual encounter might not be what one initially anticipated. It may feel awkward, clumsy, or less enjoyable than expected. This is due to the fact that sexual experiences and preferences require time, communication, and practice to develop and improve. It takes time for individuals to explore their desires and learn how to communicate them effectively with their partners. 5. Cultural and Societal Factors: One's experience with first-time sex can also be affected by cultural or societal expectations, beliefs, or pressures. Many cultures place particular meaning on a person's first sexual experience, which can lead to various emotions, such as guilt, shame, or pride, depending on individual perception and upbringing. In conclusion, experiencing sex for the first time typically involves a unique blend of emotions, sensations, and expectations. Its nature is highly personalized, and individuals often have varying experiences. Open communication, trust, and consent between partners are essential to ensure a positive experience and continuous development of intimacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: The row houses featured nearby red phone booths, where were they located? Possible A: england, living less expensively, city, town, inside car Why is \\"england\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"England\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly corresponds to the specific features mentioned in the question, which are row houses and red phone booths. These two elements are strongly associated with the culture, architecture, and history of England. Let's break down the question and the possible answers to understand why \\"England\\" is the most appropriate choice. 1. Row houses: Row houses, also known as terraced houses, are a form of residential architecture characterized by a series of identical or mirror-image houses sharing side walls with adjacent houses. This type of housing was initially developed in England during the late 17th century and gained popularity during the 19th century due to the rapid growth of the urban population and the need for efficient land use. Row houses can be found in various English cities and towns, reflecting their historical and architectural significance in the country. 2. Red phone booths: The iconic red phone booths, officially known as the K2, K6, and K8 telephone kiosks, were designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, a British architect. These phone booths were first introduced in the 1920s and quickly became a symbol of British identity. The red phone booths can still be found in many cities of England, often serving as a cultural reminder and a tourist attraction, although their practical usage has decreased dramatically with the advancement of mobile phones. Comparing the possible answers provided: a. England: As mentioned earlier, both the row houses and red phone booths are closely tied to English history and culture. Hence, England is the most appropriate answer that aligns with human common sense. b. Living less expensively: This possible answer does not directly address the location of row houses and red phone booths, as the question asks. While row houses may be more affordable in some cases, the answer does not provide sufficient context to logically conclude the location. c. City, town: These possible answers are too generic and do not address the specific location tied to the features mentioned in the question. d. Inside car: This possible answer is not relevant to the question at all. Neither row houses nor red phone booths are found inside a car, so this answer does not align with human common sense. In conclusion, \\"England\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it encompasses the distinct features mentioned in the question — row houses and red phone booths — and directly relates to the location where these features are commonly found. The cultural and historical connections between England, row houses, and red phone booths make this answer the most logical choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here are possible answers to this question: - summer - weather report - america - hot - tropics I believe the correct choice is \\"summer\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"An electric storm, also known as a thunderstorm, is a weather event characterized by the presence of lightning, thunder, and usually heavy rain. These storms can occur in various regions of the world, but there are certain factors that increase their likelihood. Of the possible answers provided, summer is indeed the most accurate choice for when an electric storm is likely to occur, and here's why: 1. Summer: Thunderstorms are more frequent during the summer months due to the increased solar energy, which leads to higher temperatures. This warming causes the air near the ground to heat up and rise, creating areas of low pressure. As the warm air rises, it cools down and condenses, forming clouds. If the conditions are right, these clouds will continue to grow vertically as more warm air rises, eventually forming the cumulonimbus clouds associated with thunderstorms. Since summer is characterized by longer daylight hours and higher temperatures, it's the prime time for thunderstorm development. 2. Weather report: Although checking a weather report can certainly be helpful in identifying when an electric storm is imminent, the weather is constantly changing, and thunderstorms can sometimes develop rapidly. While a weather report can predict thunderstorm likelihood within a certain time frame, it's not a direct cause of the electric storms themselves. 3. America: Electric storms can occur in many parts of the world, not just America. While certain regions in America, such as the Midwest and Southeast, are known for their frequent and sometimes severe thunderstorms, countries in other continents like Asia and Africa also experience electric storms. These storms are not restricted to any one geographic area. 4. Hot: Hot weather can contribute to the formation of thunderstorms, as rising warm air is an essential element in their development. However, it's worth noting that hot weather alone does not guarantee an electric storm. Other factors, such as the presence of moisture and wind patterns, also play a role in thunderstorm formation. While hot conditions definitely increase the likelihood of an electric storm, they are not the only cause. 5. Tropics: The tropics, which are warm and moist regions near the Earth's equator, do see a high incidence of thunderstorms. However, these storms are not exclusive to the tropics. Thunderstorms can also occur in temperate regions during the summer months when conditions are conducive to their development. In conclusion, summer is the correct answer to the question of when an electric storm is most likely to occur. Higher temperatures and longer daylight hours in the summer months facilitate the development of thunderstorms by creating the necessary weather conditions. While other factors, such as hot weather and tropical regions, can increase the likelihood of electric storms, they are not the sole determinants. To better predict and prepare for electric storms, keeping an eye on weather reports and understanding the conditions that lead to thunderstorms is recommended."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Hilda is set upon him to do the final act of love between the two of them, something they never ever did though they have loved each other most of their lives. She commits to the act. Then it is time for David Warner to plug up his rear hole, an act he refuses to deliver and the beautiful maid takes the responsibility on her shoulders and does the impossible act of filling his rear end hole instead of David Warner having to go through the pain. In the final scene where all his openings are filled up except for his mouth, it is time for the opera singer to plug up his facial opening while singing a most beautiful opera piece. She sings with the greatest heavenly voice by Audra McDonald into his mouth and thus takes the last breath away from him as she blocks his mouth with her lips hence delivering the last kiss of death and preventing Archie from ever breathing again.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who abandoned a romance due to someone's father? From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election. After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend. At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name. As Barry is breaking into his father's safe, however, Preston mistakes him for a burglar and kills him, but tells his butler that a burglar shot his son.

When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure. When faced with a problem, his instinct was to solve it. So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases. He avoided that by treating them... Question: Why did Mr Winton show little enthusiasm after children arrived in Britain? Options: A: He didn't want the rescue to have great impact on his future life. B: He merely wanted the children to be adopted as soon as possible. C: He felt sorry for the disappearance of 250 children on the last transport. D: He was satisfied with the effort that he had made to rescue the children.

This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Given the question \\"How would Quinn feel afterwards?\\", is \\"mean\\" a valid answer? Options: *Yes; *No; Answer:","completion":"Answer: No. A valid answer to the question \\"How would Quinn feel afterwards?\\" would require a deeper understanding of human emotions and Quinn's possible intentions in helping Addison check into rehab. The term \\"mean\\" is neither descriptive nor informative enough to account for the complexity of the situation. First, let us consider Quinn's possible emotional responses and the reasons why they helped Addison check into rehab. Some possible reasons could include concern for Addison's well-being, empathy for the struggle they are going through, and the desire to help their friend regain control over their life. In such cases, Quinn may feel relief, happiness, or hopefulness that they were able to offer support and help their friend take a significant step toward recovery. Second, it is essential to understand that emotions are not universally experienced in the same way. Depending on the nature of the relationship between Quinn and Addison, Quinn might also feel sadness, worry, or even guilt for not noticing the warning signs of Addison's impending addiction earlier. Alternatively, if the decision to help Addison was met with resistance, Quinn might feel anxious about how their relationship will be affected in the future. In any case, the emotional response to the situation is likely to be far more nuanced than simply labeling it as \\"mean.\\" To effectively answer the question, one must consider a broader range of emotions, as well as the context and relationship between the two individuals involved."},{"prompt":"What is the final step of the following process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere The answer to this question is:","completion":"The final step of the process is that the increased amount of trapped heat radiation in the atmosphere due to human activities leads to a rise in global temperatures, resulting in climate change and its associated impacts on ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carradine was born on December 8, 1936 as John Arthur Carradine, in Hollywood, California, the oldest child of actor John Carradine and his wife Ardanelle Abigail (McCool). He was a half-brother of Bruce, Keith, Christopher, and Robert Carradine, and an uncle of Ever Carradine and Martha Plimpton, most of whom are also actors. Primarily of Irish descent, he was a great-grandson of Methodist evangelical author Beverly Carradine and a grandnephew of artist Will Foster. Called Jack by his family, Carradine's childhood was turbulent. On June 3, 2009, at the age of 72, David Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissotel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road, near Sukhumvit Road, in central Bangkok, Thailand. He was in Bangkok to shoot his latest film, titled Stretch. A police official said that Carradine was found naked, hanging by a rope in the room's closet, causing immediate speculation that his death was suicide. However, reported evidence suggested that his death was accidental, the result of autoerotic asphyxiation. Two autopsies were conducted, one involving the celebrity pathologist Pornthip Rojanasunan, and both concluded that the death was not a suicide. The cause of death became widely accepted as \\"accidental asphyxiation.\\" Immediately following his death, two of Carradine's former wives, Gail Jensen and Marina Anderson, stated publicly that his sexual interests included the practice of self-bondage. Anderson, who had plans to publish a tell-all book about her marriage to Carradine, said in an interview with Access Hollywood, \\"There was a dark side to David, there was a very intense side to David. People around him know that.\\" Previously, in her divorce filing, she had claimed that \\"it was the continuation of abhorrent and deviant sexual behavior which was potentially deadly.\\" Photographs of Carradine at the death scene, as well as photographs of his autopsied body, were circulated in newspapers and on the Internet. His family, represented by his brothers, Keith and Robert, pleaded with the public and the press to let them mourn their loved one in peace. Carradine's funeral was held on June 13, 2009, in Los Angeles. His bamboo casket was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Among the many stars and family members who attended his private memorial were Tom Selleck, Lucy Liu, Frances Fisher, James Cromwell, Steve Railsback, and Chris Potter. His grave was marked on December 3, 2009. The monument proclaimed him to be \\"The Barefoot Legend\\" and included a quote from \\"Paint\\", a song he wrote and performed as the theme to Sonny Boy, as an epitaph.

В русском языке выбор порядка выделения абзацев может быть схожим с английским, а может и отличаться. Одним из наиболее распространенных правил является то, что абзац должен содержать не менее одного предложения, отражающего определенную мысль или идею. Если абзац состоит из нескольких подряд идущих строк текста, то они должны быть связаны логически, чтобы поддерживать смысловое и структурное единое целое. Это очень важно для обеспечения ясности и понятности текстового материала. В противном случае разделение на абзацы теряет свою практическую ценность, и восприятие текста становится затруднительным."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Make the cell parts. Add the cell parts. Make a table or key that defines each part.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Creating an Educational Cell Model Using Styrofoam and Craft Materials Introduction: The study of cells is an essential component of biology that helps us understand the fundamental processes of life. To present such intricate concepts visually and effectively, creating a cell model can be an excellent teaching tool for both educators and students. In this article, we will delve into making an educational cell model by employing readily available materials like styrofoam and craft supplies. We will outline the simple steps required and even guide you on making a table or key to help explain various cell parts. So, get ready to dive into the fascinating world of cells! Step 1: Obtain the Materials To begin crafting a cell model, gather the following materials: - A styrofoam base, ideally in the shape of a circle or oval - Craft supplies to represent various cell components (colored paper, beads, pipe cleaners, etc.) - A craft knife - Acrylic paint and paintbrushes - A ruler and a marking tool (like a pen or pencil) - Glue or adhesive Step 2: Prepare the Styrofoam Base Carefully measure and mark a 1/4 section of the styrofoam base using the ruler and marking tool. Next, employ the craft knife to cut away the designated section. This step enables viewers of the model to get an interior glimpse while reinforcing the concept of cells being three-dimensional structures. Step 3: Paint the Styrofoam Base Paint the entire styrofoam base using acrylic paints. For a more accurate representation, consider painting the exterior portion in a darker tone to represent the cell membrane while using a lighter shade for the inside to depict the cytoplasm. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly before proceeding. Step 4: Create the Cell Components Utilizing the craft materials, construct various cell components such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, and others. Different cell components can be given distinct colors and shapes, making it easier for viewers to identify each part. For example, use a large bead for the nucleus, pipe cleaners for the endoplasmic reticulum, or small beads for the ribosomes. Step 5: Attach the Cell Components Once the craft-made cell components are complete, arrange them within the styrofoam base to accurately represent their positions inside the cell. Use glue or adhesive to attach these parts securely. Ensure that their placement mirrors the accurate spatial relationships found in an actual cell. Step 6: Create a Table or Key After completing the cell model, produce a table or key that identifies each part. This table should provide the name of the cell component, its appearance in the model (such as color or shape), and a brief description of its function. Students can use this table as a reference tool while examining and studying the cell model. Conclusion: By following these straightforward steps, you can create an engaging and educational cell model that effectively illustrates the structure and function of different cell components. From obtaining the materials to creating a helpful table or key, this approach is both user-friendly and scientifically accurate. Your finished cell model will not only serve as an invaluable teaching tool but also spark interest and curiosity in the fascinating world of biology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which American President saw active service in both the first and second World Wars?","completion":"I will now find out which American President saw active service in both the first and second World Wars. Step 1: Identify the time period of the first and second World Wars. The First World War took place from 1914 to 1918, and the Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945. Step 2: Determine which American Presidents were serving during the relevant time periods or were young and old enough to have been involved in both wars. Woodrow Wilson was the President during WWI, and there were four Presidents during WWII: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy. Other Presidents who were alive during the period and might have served in both wars are Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Step 3: Research the military service records of the potential candidates. After researching, it appears that: - Theodore Roosevelt did not actively serve in either war. - Woodrow Wilson did not participate in combat and was the President during WWI. - Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover did not serve in either war. - Franklin D. Roosevelt was the President during most of WWII, but he didn't see active service in either war, as he was Assistant Secretary of the Navy during WWI. - Harry S. Truman served in combat during WWI and became President during the last months of WWII. - Dwight D. Eisenhower served in the Army during both wars, starting as a junior officer in WWI and later becoming a general in WWII. - John F. Kennedy served only in WWII. - Lyndon B. Johnson was not an active participant in WWI and saw limited service in WWII. Based on the above information, Dwight D. Eisenhower is the American President who saw active service in both the first and second World Wars. He started as a junior officer during WWI and later became a general during WWII, overseeing the Allied forces in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama earned just over 600,000 in 2012, far less than they took in during 2011, according to their tax return, released by the White House on Friday. The Obamas reported an adjusted gross income of 608,611 during the election year, more than 180,000 less than they grossed for the previous year. They paid 112,214 in federal taxes, an effective rate of 18.4 percent. In 2011, they paid an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. The release of the first couple's tax return comes with far less fanfare than a year ago, when the president spent the week before Tax Day advocating for the Buffett rule, which would set a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on those earning more than 1 million annually. The Obama campaign quickly followed up on the release of the returns of the president and Vice President Joe Biden by calling on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to release his tax returns, something he resisted doing throughout the campaign. This time around, though, the closest thing to controversy is the president's commitment to write a check back to the Treasury Department for five percent of his 400,000 salary, in a sign of support for federal employees facing furloughs because of sequestration. Biden, who grossed just over half of what the president did, has said he will share the pain of sequestration that his office's staff face, but has not yet detailed what that would mean. (Also on POLITICO: Obama's TOP 5 fights with his base) The drop in the Obamas' income last year is largely due to smaller earnings from sales of the president's books, from 441,000 in 2011 to 259,000 in 2012. With the fall in income came smaller charitable contributions in 2012. In all, the Obamas gave just over 150,000 -- 24.6 percent of their gross -- to 33 charities. The biggest single contribution was 103,871 to the Fisher House Foundation, to which the president has committed to contribute proceeds from his children's book. In 2011, they gave 172,130 to charity, including 117,130 to Fisher House. The Obamas' joint income dropped precipitously from their first two years in the White House. With big book sales, they grossed 5.5 million in 2009, including 1.4 million Nobel Prize award money. With book sales still doing well in 2010, the Obamas earned just short of 1.8 million that year. Earnings for the vice president and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, a community college professor, in 2012 were roughly in line with previous years. They reported an adjusted gross income of 385,072 last year, up from 379,035 in 2011. They paid 87,851 in federal taxes. The Bidens gave 7,190 to charity in 2012, including 2,400 to Catholic Diocese of Wilmington. While most of their income came from salaries, the first couple also grossed 26,400 from renting a cottage on the property of their Delaware home to the secret service. They netted 17,944 on that. ||||| Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016. These files are currently not publicly accessible. Properties of this collection.

Here is a detailed explanation of each term: Question 1: \\"What is the meaning of 'vox organalis'?\\" \\"Vox organalis\\" is a term used in the realm of music, particularly in the study of medieval European music. It refers to the voice or voices that perform the melody originating from the plainchant in organum. Organum is one of the earliest forms of polyphony, which is a style of music involving two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody. In organum, the original plainchant melody is called the \\"vox principalis\\" or \\"cantus firmus\\" (meaning the original or main song), and the added voice(s) or part(s) that harmonize with the cantus firmus are known as the \\"vox organalis.\\" The harmony created by the vox organalis is usually parallel, meaning it follows the contour of the main melody but at a certain interval. This early form of harmony laid the foundation for much of Western classical music. Question 2: \\"What does 'beghairat' mean?\\" \\"Beghairat\\" is a term used in Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi languages. It is an adjective that is formed from the combination of two words: \\"be\\" (meaning without) and \\"ghairat\\" (meaning honor or dignity). Therefore, the word \\"beghairat\\" refers to someone who has no honor or dignity. It is a derogatory term used to criticize and demean a person for their lack of moral values, ethics, or self-respect. People who are considered shameless or who have wronged others without remorse can be labeled as \\"beghairat.\\" In conclusion, while both the terms \\"vox organalis\\" and \\"beghairat\\" are unique and specific to their respective fields (music and languages), their meanings differ considerably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are wonderful and beautiful and worthy of everything good in life. This book will not pick you up - it will tear you down. Certainly we should all strive to be healthy, but at what cost? Never at losing your self-respect. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The reviewer appears to be quite dissatisfied with the book they are discussing, as evident in the title \\"Bloody rubbish... is that English enough?\\" which carries a strong negative connotation. The use of the phrase “bloody rubbish” indicates that the reviewer found the content to be of poor quality and valueless. Throughout the review, the reviewer repeatedly points out several aspects they found to be offensive and disturbing. For example, they mention that the book has a \\"slight glaring edge when written by someone who has never experienced a true weight problem.\\" This statement implies that the author lacks empathy and understanding, further contributing to the negative tone of the review. The most significant indication of the negative tone comes from the reviewer's strong disapproval of the book's perceived message. They summarize the message as \\"no man will ever want you for who you are\\" and go on to characterize it as \\"a load of crap.\\" This harsh language shows that the reviewer not only dislikes the content, but also finds it harmful and damaging to the readers. The reviewer even goes as far as to advise readers to \\"burn your copy immediately\\" as a means of protecting themselves from the negative effects of the book.

Q:Question: \\"when did the kingdom of asturias split into three separate kingdoms?\\" Context: \\"After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias, King Alfonso III of Asturias knighted Vimara Peres, in 868 AD, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as Portucale, Portugale, and simultaneously Portugália — the County of Portugal. Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Spain due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms of León, Galicia and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (León and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of León.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms of León, Galicia, and Asturias in 910 AD after the forced abdication of King Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" by his sons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Synthetic peptides showing high substrate activity for specific groups of protein tyrosine kinases have been obtained. Systematic modification of certain substrate peptides suggests that kinase substrate determinants reside with specific amino acid residues proximal to the target tyrosine.

I gotta say, my initial impression of this place wasn't a good one. We walked in just after noon and found only 2 other tables in the entire place to be occupied. Then when we got seated, we had a super weird start where we basically got juggled around with 3 separate waiters/waitresses coming up to our table. Luckily, it was smooth sailing after that and I was extremely surprised with Biscuits Cafu00e9. The restaurant itself is located on the SE corner of Sahara & Durango. Inside, they've got a really big, spacious dining room and they seem to be doing a great job of keeping it clean and organized. Instead of getting too into detail on what it looks like, I'll shamelessly plug my first opportunity to try out the Yelp video function. ;) *Although you might have to go to the business photos on the mobile app to find it* As far as the food goes, they have a fairly large menu with choices for both breakfast and lunch. I ended up going with the Zesty Chorizo omelette and was really impressed. The chorizo was cooked perfectly, had great flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat. All the other ingredients were fresh and aside from tasting great, the portions are huge. They literally put what looked to be an entire avocado inside the omelette and it's served with a side of your choice, and biscuits. The salsa appeared to be fresh made and was easily one of the best I've had in a breakfast joint. My only complaint on my plate would be the potatoes. They were cooked well and also served as a huge portion, but they were lacking in salt. If I were to order this omelette again though, I'd ask for extra cheese. Now, with a name like Biscuits Cafu00e9...they better have some good biscuits! Were they the best I've ever had? Probably not. But they are solid and in my opinion, far superior to what you'll find in most other restaurants in town. Buttery, flaky and served with both fresh butter and jam. You can tell they are fresh made every day and even though I'm not usually one to get biscuits for breakfast, I'd make sure to get one every time I'm here. Biscuits and gravy fans will love the version here. Aside from the weird start, the customer service is great too. I could be wrong, but it looks like a family run joint and even if they aren't, you can tell they put a lot of love into their food. As others have mentioned, it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting busy and you're waiting for a table. It may have started off bad and a dead restaurant at peak times, is almost always a red flag...but Biscuits Cafu00e9 is serving up huge portions of killer food at great prices, and I'll happily be a repeat customer!

Given the question: Background: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market...

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. Murray Rothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Poland and Russia, respectively. David Rothbard was a chemist. Murray attended Birch Wathen, a private school in New York City. Rothbard later stated that he much preferred Birch Wathen to the \\"debasing and egalitarian public school system\\" he had previously attended in the Bronx. Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a \\"right-winger\\" (adherent of the \\"Old Right\\") among friends and neighbors who were \\"communists or fellow-travelers.\\" Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, free enterprise, private property, and \\"a determination to rise by one's own merits\\". \\"[A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent.\\" He attended Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time. During the 1940s Rothbard became acquainted with Frank Chodorov and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken and others, as well as Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching at the Wall Street division of New York University Business School, Rothbard attended Mises' unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises' book, Human Action. Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote various \\"right-wing\\" ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain Human Action in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises' views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund, which designated him a \\"senior analyst.\\" As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was Rothbard's book Man, Economy, and State, published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.

The 29-year-old beat Fernando Verdasco to win the title for the first time. But a fourth-round defeat by Mischa Zverev at the Australian Open in January means Murray has ground to make up on Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Grigor Dimitrov, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Dominic Thiem and David Goffin in the 2017 rankings. He is, however, likely to retain the number one ranking until at least the French Open. \\"I felt like I wasn't a bad player just because I lost a match at the Australian Open,\\" he told BBC Sport after a 16-hour flight from Dubai to Los Angeles. \\"Australia wasn't my tournament but I took a break after that, chatted to my team about things that I needed to work on, worked on them, and got to Dubai early. \\"I played some good stuff where I hadn't played well in the past. So that gave me a bit of a boost coming here, which is also a place where I haven't played my best.\\" Murray was the runner-up to Nadal at Indian Wells in 2009, but in the past six years has suffered early defeats at the hands of Donald Young, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez and - in last year's third round - Federico Delbonis. The thin desert air makes the ball fly and jump off the court, and last year played havoc with the Scot's serve. He held back, for fear of missing, and was beaten in the second match he played. His preparation had also been far from ideal. On the Sunday before an event due to be staged outdoors in 30C desert heat, Murray spent four hours and 54 minutes beating Kei Nishikori in the Davis Cup on an indoor court eight time zones away in Glasgow. However, this year's warm up in Dubai was much preferable and Murray was enthusiastic when talking about Great Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final in France. That tie was secured in February when Britain beat Canada 3-2 without their leading player and will be held after the Miami Masters, which follows Indian Wells. \\"It will have been a long stretch, but to get matches on clay is a positive thing - and my team are more pro it,\\" Murray said. \\"If I'd gone to Canada, it would have been bad news because physically I was not ready. I was struggling a little bit with the illness so it was a good thing I didn't go.\\" Having overcome shingles, Murray now has the awkward desert conditions to overcome, but has been given a favourable draw in Indian Wells.

Heckel was 40-years-old when she disappeared her body was never found.","completion":"Title: Loyd Groves' Arrest: Revisiting the Unsolved 1991 Murder of Katherine Heckel Subtitle: Investigators Reopen the Cold Case Decades After the Tragic Disappearance Introduction: In a stunning development, Loyd Groves, 65, was arrested and charged with the murder of Katherine Heckel, whose disappearance in 1991 remains unsolved. Investigators recently reopened Heckel's homicide case in an effort to finally bring closure to the victim's family and deliver justice to her killer. The case's reopening marks a significant breakthrough in an investigation that has gone cold for nearly three decades. Step 1: Discuss Katherine Heckel's Disappearance Katherine Heckel was 40 years old when she vanished from her hometown in 1991. A loving and devoted mother, her disappearance left her family devastated and her community searching for answers. Despite extensive searches, her body was never found, causing the investigation into her murder to go cold for many years. The absence of crucial physical evidence, like Heckel's body, made it extremely difficult for investigators to form any concrete leads. Step 2: Detail the Decision to Reopen the Investigation Though Katherine Heckel's case went cold over the years, her family never gave up hope that her murderer would be brought to justice. Thanks to advances in investigative techniques and technology, cold cases, like Katherine's, are now often revisited by law enforcement in an effort to solve previously unsolvable cases. This development yielded positive results, as investigators decided to reopen Heckel's homicide investigation to examine the case with fresh eyes and new methodologies. Step 3: Mention the Arrest of Loyd Groves As the investigation into Katherine Heckel's murder reopened, the focus turned to Loyd Groves, a 65-year-old man with connections to Heckel. Following an intensive investigation utilizing modern day resources, the team of investigators found enough evidence to arrest Groves on charges of homicide in connection with Heckel's disappearance. Step 4: Describe the Impact of This Arrest on the Victim's Family and Community Although the arrest of Loyd Groves brings the potential for justice and closure to Katherine Heckel's family, it must also be acknowledged that this development brings to the surface old emotions and painful memories. Even though nearly three decades have passed since her disappearance, the pain of losing a loved one to such a heinous crime never fully dissipates. This arrest is a step forward for the family and community, who have long awaited answers and justice for Katherine. Step 5: Offer Hope for Cold Cases Moving Forward The arrest of Loyd Groves in connection with the case of Katherine Heckel shows that cold cases can be solved with perseverance and innovative investigative techniques. As technology continues to advance, so does the potential for solving other cold cases. This case has renewed hope for other families affected by unsolved cases that one day their loved ones' murderers will also be brought to justice. Conclusion: The tragic story of Katherine Heckel's untimely death and the arrest of Loyd Groves, 29 years later, offers a powerful reminder that cold cases can be solved with determined efforts and the right resources. The reopening of Heckel's homicide investigation promises to deliver justice and answers to a family that has waited for decades. Moreover, this case serves as a beacon of hope for thousands of other families affected by unsolved crimes that justice may still be within reach in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. But I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. What is an answer for this question: Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's follow the information step by step. 1. Compound A is a polar compound, while compound B is a nonpolar compound. 2.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I've been depressed my entire life over my lack of wit and creativity. How do I recover from being speech-delayed in my early childhood? I'm a man in my early 40s. I feel stuck and that I've wasted my life and it's compounding my depression. How can I change? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning, as both address different aspects of your situation. However, they are closely related, given that they both deal with feelings of frustration, depression, and a desire to change. Let's break down each question and explore potential ways to address these concerns. 1) Recovering from speech delay in early childhood and dealing with a lack of wit and creativity: First of all, it's essential to understand that many people experience challenges during their early childhood that impact their lives long-term, but these challenges can be overcome, and one can develop valuable skills and strengths in the process. In your case, the lingering effects of speech delay seem to have affected your self-esteem, particularly regarding your wit and creativity. To begin a journey of recovery and self-improvement, consider the following steps: a) Acknowledge your progress: Understand that your current communication abilities reflect impressive growth since early childhood, even if your development was delayed. Recognize that you have come far, and you have the potential for further improvement. b) Engage in activities that promote creativity and wit: Join a local theater group, take comedy or writing classes, or attend conferences where creative professionals share their experiences. Pushing your boundaries by trying new things can unlock your creative side and improve your wit. c) Seek therapy or support groups: Connecting with professionals who specialize in speech and language development or joining support groups comprised of people who face similar challenges can provide valuable insights and coping mechanisms. This avenue provides an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. 2) Dealing with depression and a feeling of wasted life as you enter your 40s: Feeling trapped and convinced that you have wasted your life is a challenging mental state to overcome but recognize that you are not alone in this struggle, and many people have successfully navigated these emotions to transform their lives. To initiate change and address your feelings of depression, consider these approaches: a) Identify areas you wish to improve: Whether it's your career, relationships, or personal growth, determine which aspects of your life you would like to enhance. This identification process will provide direction and clarity during your journey of change. b) Set realistic goals: Break down your larger objectives into smaller, attainable milestones that you can focus on and accomplish. This approach can create a sense of progress and momentum, reducing feelings of being stuck or wasting time. c) Engage in hobbies or activities that bring you joy: Cultivate interests and passions that promote positive feelings, engaging both your body and mind. Activities like exercise, meditation, or volunteering can provide a sense of purpose, accomplishment, and happiness. d) Seek therapy or counseling: Working with a mental health professional can help you navigate your thought patterns and emotions more effectively. A therapist or counselor can collaborate with you to develop coping strategies and provide guidance on how to overcome depressive feelings. In conclusion, although these questions do not bear the same meaning, they share a common theme of depression and a desire for change. Pursuing a multifaceted approach that includes self-reflection, goal setting, seeking professional guidance, and engaging in activities that stimulate growth and creativity will help you overcome these challenges and significantly improve your well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"As you stroll along its various shopping streets look for significant Islamic monuments.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"While you stroll keep an eye out for islamic monuments. \\"?","completion":"If the premise is true, that \\"As you stroll along its various shopping streets, look for significant Islamic monuments,\\" it would entail the hypothesis \\"While you stroll, keep an eye out for Islamic monuments.\\" The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be broken down as follows: 1. The premise indicates that while strolling along various shopping streets, the individual should look for significant Islamic monuments. 2. The hypothesis suggests that during the stroll, one should keep an eye out for Islamic monuments. Both the premise and the hypothesis share common themes and expectations, namely that the focus of the stroll is to observe and appreciate Islamic monuments. There are slight differences in vocabulary and phrasing, but the key message remains the same: the individual is expected to pay attention to Islamic monuments while exploring the shopping streets. The premise does not provide specific details on the type or location of these Islamic monuments, so it can be concluded that they are likely dispersed throughout the shopping streets, making it possible for the individual to observe them during their stroll. The hypothesis, in turn, reiterates the importance of keeping an eye out for these monuments while strolling. This can be seen as a restatement of the premise, thereby reaffirming that the aforementioned idea is crucial. The hypothesis emphasizes the expectation of paying attention to the monuments and not letting them go unnoticed. Thus, if the premise that \\"As you stroll along its various shopping streets, look for significant Islamic monuments\\" is true, it does entail the hypothesis \\"While you stroll, keep an eye out for Islamic monuments.\\" The hypotheses reinforce each other and emphasize the importance of being attentive to Islamic architectural heritage while exploring shopping streets. In both cases, the individual is prompted to actively search for and appreciate these historical and culturally significant Islamic monuments as they take in their surroundings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Bill Sharp, 65, was the the son of a unionised stevedore who loaded and unloaded the ships at the East End's Royal Albert docks. He left grammar school at the age of 15 wanting something more. And he got it - a career in the City and the trappings which come with it. Now living in Hadleigh near Southend, he continues to run his stockbroking firm and work as a consultant. For Mr Sharp, taking his place outside St Paul's Cathedral to say a final farewell was a foregone conclusion. He allowed BBC News to join him on his journey from Essex to central London as Margaret Thatcher was his political inspiration. \\"She means a great deal to me,\\" he said. \\"It was in about 1970 that I started to recognise her. \\"I became a councillor back in 1978 based on listening to her. \\"She wasn't the first woman prime minister to me, she was the leader of our party and she did a wonderful job.\\" Their paths were to cross a number of times. Mr Sharp made three visits to Downing Street during her tenure, enjoyed a dinner in her company (with others) and was at the Conservative Party conference in 1984 at Brighton's Grand Hotel when five people were killed and 31 were injured. An aspiring politician, Mr Sharp had put his name down to speak on five different subjects. He ended up speaking about the community charge (often referred to as the poll tax) - the subject he had prepared least for. But it was the speech the prime minister delivered the day after the bomb that he remembers most vividly. \\"The speech was magnificent. There was an explosion of support for her,\\" he said. \\"I am delighted to be able to say that I met her, shook her hand, listened to her and was told off by her, and followed her principles through my life.\\" Mr Sharp is proud of the parallels between his own humble upbringing and those of Margaret Thatcher, the grocer's daughter. He said: \\"She was wealthy compared with my family roots. \\"My father was a union man, I understand unionism but I didn't find socialism the answer. If you go out and work, you can contribute to your family.\\" While the then Margaret Roberts lost out when she contested the parliamentary seat of Dartford in the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Mr Sharp unsuccessfully fought the Barking seat just across the Thames in 1987. His campaign slogan was simple: \\"She trusts him, why don't you?\\" The she, of course, was Baroness Thatcher. Since then, Mr Sharp has focused on local politics and continues to serve on Castle Point Borough Council. He said: \\"I will be standing there with sympathy in my heart, and gratitude for what she did for this nation, for what she did for me personally and for what she did for the party. \\"People either loved her or hated her. A bit like me.\\" Summary:","completion":"Bill Sharp, a 65-year-old stockbroking firm owner and consultant, shares his admiration for Margaret Thatcher, who greatly inspired him politically. Leaving school at 15, Sharp went on to find success in the City and now lives in Hadleigh. As a city councillor, he crossed paths with Thatcher multiple times, even speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Brighton. Sharp appreciates the similarities in their humble upbringings – Thatcher being a grocer's daughter – and remains active in local politics. Thatcher's impact on Sharp's life and political career is undeniable, with him stating that people either loved or hated her, much like himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: who is socially awkward bacteriologist? Movie title: The Painted Veil Movie plot: On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband.

In the first sentence, it presents a weekly gain of 17.27 points or 1.2 percent, without any specific information about daily gains or losses and any consecutive relation of the gains or losses across the week.

The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. It is known for extensive use of segues in their live performances, and was considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival. Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla, and keyboardist Ben Wilson. On August 20, 1999, Bobby Sheehan was found dead in his New Orleans, Louisiana home, where he had been recording music with some friends the night before. Sheehan's death was ruled an accidental drug overdose, with cocaine, Valium, and heroin found in his system. The remaining members of Blues Traveler convened and agreed that Sheehan would have wanted them to continue as a band. Auditions for a new bassist were held in concert, and included Chan Kinchla's younger brother Tad, who was unanimously determined to be the best choice for the role. Additionally, an open call was sent for a permanent keyboard player, a role of which Sheehan had often been a proponent. In January 2000, Ben Wilson of the jump blues band Big Dave & the Ultrasonics was chosen, and has since become a central contributor to the band's songwriting. The band discarded their concept album material, instead releasing a smaller online EP, Decisions of the Sky: A Traveler's Tale of Sun and Storm, and went to work collectively composing a new set of songs with the new lineup. The resulting album was Bridge, which had the working title Bridge Outta Brooklyn as a tribute to Sheehan (with both the acronym B.O.B. and his nickname \\"Brooklyn Bobby\\"). The songs \\"Girl Inside My Head\\" and \\"Just for Me\\" received airplay, but the album's sales fell somewhat short of expectations. The live album What You and I Have Been Through and the compilation Travelogue: Blues Traveler Classics were both released in 2002.

Input: UK-wide research indicated that the Glasgow area comes third for pedestrian drunkenness, just behind Greater London and Kent. The past year saw 126 injuries to people on foot in Glasgow who had been drinking. Road safety campaigners have urged people to give more thought to their journey home, even if they are walking. Liz Brooker of Road Safety UK said: \\"The biggest issue with drunk walking is that they would be over what we would call the drink-drive limit. \\"It would impair them enough to see very clearly, they wouldn't have a good sense of judgement.\\" Party season The research, commissioned by the website confused.com, suggested that men and people under the age of 24 were most at risk. In total, 21% of people contacted by researchers across the UK said they had walked home after consuming eight drinks or more. The research was published as Police Scotland warned people to be on the alert for opportunistic criminals when they are out celebrating during the party season. The force has teamed up with British Transport Police, NHS, the Scottish Ambulance Service, Best Bar None and other organisations to drive home the message as part of a festive safety campaign. The dangers they have highlighted included pick-pockets, unlicensed taxis and drink-spiking. Opportunistic criminals Insp Scott Tees, of Police Scotland, said: \\"The final weekend before Christmas is always the busiest time with people having office parties and nights out. \\"It's also very alluring to the opportunistic criminal, who preys on people who've had a bit too much to drink.\\" He said people should keep an eye on their drinks, bags and jackets and stay away from illicit substances and legal highs as well as watching out for unlicensed taxis. \\"It is the party season, so have a great time, but try and drink responsibly, as the more you drink the more your judgement is clouded and you can be less aware of what's happening around you,\\" Insp Tees added. David Duthie, of Best Bar None Scotland, said: \\"Best Bar None is an integral part of the Safer Areas Initiatives throughout Scotland and aims to positively enhance the night-time economy by rewarding venues which promote a responsible drinking environment. \\"We want you to enjoy yourselves over the festive period.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Parts of a Neuron As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma = “body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is that they have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are usually described as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells. That single axon can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another.

Americans look to New Zealand and Australia to flee Trump Anxiety over a Donald Trump presidency is driving some Americans to seek escape in far-flung places such as New Zealand and Australia. The words “New Zealand immigration” began trending on Google late Tuesday night, hitting its 24-hour high at 4:04 a.m. on Wednesday. “I got lots of messages coming through at the moment asking for a job in New Zealand,” New Zealand software executive Rod Drury told Reuters. “It will be interesting to see whether it translates into real action, it’s an active conversation that moved to getting more serious and we’ll what will happen in the next month.” The words “Australia immigration” also peaked at about the same time as New Zealand interest reached high-water marks. “If this ends badly, is either Australia or New Zealand going to let me stay?” wondered New York criminal defense lawyer Eliza Orlins. A host of celebrities had, before Tuesday night, vowed to leave the US if Trump became president. Those promises by Lena Dunham, Bryan Cranston, Barbra Streisand, Stephen King and Ne-Yo appeared to prompt others to think of the Great White North, too, as the Canadian federal immigration website crashed from an overload of visitors for several hours early Wednesday. “There is no way to mince words about the result. Donald Trump, who in the early hours of Wednesday morning won the presidency of the United States, is not the ideal candidate for the job,” according to an editorial from The Globe & Mail, widely regarded as Canada’s national paper. With the two nations sharing a continent-long border and so many economic and cultural interests, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no choice but to forge some kind of working relationship with Trump, the paper said. “Mr. Trump is not the ideal president for America, or for Canada,” according to The Globe & Mail. “But Ottawa never gets to choose who it has to work with in Washington.

Question: Fourteen is not an age at which you try to earn millions of dollars. But for Bangalore boy, Suhas Gopinath, it was. One day in August, 1999, Suhas, studying at the Air Force School in Hebbal, was surfing the Net at a cyber cafe. He happened to hit an MSN source code . That made him decide to learn more about HTML and to design and set up his own website under the address of a US-based company, Network Solutions. He kept updating his website, posting interesting things on it. This impressed Network Solutions and they invited him to attend a class on Web design and development. His mom and uncle criticised him for not taking his education seriously. But gradually, his dad started encouraging him and even bought him a computer and Net connection. In fact, that was his first investment in the company. On May 14, 2000, along with friends Clifford Leslie and Binay M. N, he floated his own website -- www.coolhindustani.com. He did not have the money to start, for his parents refused to give him a penny. So he wrote to Network Solutions Inc. in the US and they readily agreed. In August, the same year, he set up Globals Inc., a Web solutions and networking company, with a team of four. Now, he has 400 employees, more than 200 customers across the globe and offices in 11 countries, and he is worth over 100 million. After finishing his high school education, he studied at Stanford University for two years. But Suhas says: \\"Education alone will not make a good professional .\\" What is TRUE about Globals Inc.?

It implies that a conclusion or permission has been reached based on prior information or discussion. 2. \\"you can\\" - This phrase grants permission or acknowledges the ability of the person being addressed to perform a certain action. 3. \\"go right ahead\\" - This phrase encourages immediate action without any further delay or hesitation. 4. \\"tell us\\" - This portion directs the person being addressed to provide information or narrate an account to the speaker and/or other listeners. 5. \\"the whole story\\" - This final part emphasizes the desire for a complete and thorough account, rather than a partial or summarized version. Now let's examine the hypothesis, \\"Please proceed with the story in its entirety.\\" 1. \\"Please\\" - This word is a polite request or expression of desire for a specific action. 2. \\"proceed\\" - This verb indicates a continuation or the act of going forward with a particular action or process. 3. \\"with the story\\" - This component refers to the narration or account that has been previously addressed or discussed. 4. \\"in its entirety\\" - This phrase reinforces the desire for a comprehensive and unabridged account, not leaving out any details or parts. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that both statements share the core request for a complete and exhaustive account of a story. The premise grants permission and encourages immediate action, while the hypothesis politely requests the same outcome with a focus on thoroughness. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the premise \\"So you can go right ahead and tell us the whole story\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Please proceed with the story in its entirety.\\" While the two statements may have slight differences in tone and formality, they both convey the same underlying expectation—providing a complete and detailed account of the story. In summary, the premise supports and implies the hypothesis, indicating that if the premise is true, then it is also valid to assume that the hypothesis holds true as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the bounce castle became detached from its stakes in the ground, the two were taken for a painful ride, 300 feet across the soccer field. Madison fell out of the castle along the way, but Ruder was trapped inside until the house finally came to a rest and says he lost consciousness. Scroll down for video. Not fun: AJ Ruder, 11 (left), and 12-year-old Madison Kelsay (right) were injured Saturday when a bounce-castle slide became untethered and took them for a painful ride across a soccer field in Littleton, Colorado. Tumbling: A spectator at the lacrosse tournament took video of the bounce slide being blown 300 feet across the soccer field. Must be stopped: Parents are seen in the video chasing after the castle, trying to bring it to rest. Injured: Both children were treated at the scene and one of the ten-year-olds was taken to urgent care. 'It was like I was picked up into the air and I was just thrown around a lot,' A.J. Ruder told ABC News. 'I couldn't get a grip on anything.' 'By the time I hit the ground, I just pretty much blacked out,' he said. The two children escaped with just minor injuries, and AJ sported a brace on his left foot during the GMA interview. However, when the parents saw their children flung around in the bounce house they feared much worse. Thankfully, Madison and AJ received only minor injuries. AJ pictured above wearing a brace on his left foot. 'It was just complete terror,' Madison's mother Cassie Kelsay said. 'He was emotionless, expressionless,' AJ's dad Brian Ruder said of when he saw his son laying helpless on the ground. 'His eyes were opened in shock.' Madison says she won't be going back into a bounce house anytime soon while AJ says he won't enter one ever again. Madison's mom Cassie Kelsay (right), says she was overcome with terror when she saw the bounce slide blow away. Pictured above with her daughter and husband Shane. Brian Ruder says his son was emotionless, and expressionless, when he found him lying helpless on the ground after the incident. Airbound, the company that owns and operates the slide, issued a statement to ABC, saying: 'We feel terrible for what happened. Safety is our No. 1 concern.'

First, we have a math problem that looks like this: -19 * q + 247 = -0 * q - 342 Since multiplying anything (including q) by 0 is 0, we can remove \\"-0 * q\\" from the equation. Now, it looks like this: -19 * q + 247 = -342 Next, we want to get q all by itself. To do that, let's start by moving the \\"+ 247\\" to the other side. We'll do this by subtracting 247 from both sides of the equation. The equation will now look like this: -19 * q = -342 - 247 Now, let's do the subtraction on the right side of the equation: -19 * q = -589 We're almost there! To completely solve for q, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -19. So it should look like this: q = (-589) / (-19) When we divide -589 by -19, we get: q = 31 And that's our answer!

A bouncer who beat and strangled his girlfriend to death before driving around for two days with her body stashed in the boot of a car has been jailed for life. Aaron Mann, 33, broke Claire O'Connor's jaw and two of her ribs before throttling her in the early hours of January 1 2012, after the couple had returned to the home they shared in Warwickshire following a New Year's Eve party. Mann then dumped mother-of-four Ms O'Connor's body in her Ford Focus and drove it around for two days, before parking it outside his. parents’ home and telling them what he had done. 'Evil killer': Aaron Mann (left), 33, strangled his girlfriend Claire O'Connor (right), 38, to death after a New Year's Eve party then tried to hide her body. The 38-year-old's body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her car on January 2 last year. Mann told a court ‘voices in his head’ told him to kill his lover, and denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But he was sentenced to life in prison today, after being found guilty of murder yesterday following a week-long trial. Warwick Crown Court heard how he had previously sent his girlfriend chilling death threats; one which read 'You aint going to be around for long', and another that said simply 'I will kill you'. Mann was told he must service a minimum of 16 years in court today. Domestic violence: The body of the mother-of-four was discovered wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her Ford Focus on January 2 last year. His victim's heartbroken parents Graham and Patricia Griffiths said after the sentencing they had been in 'no doubt' that Mann was guilty of the 'savage and brutal murder of our daughter'. 'We would like to thank the jury, who have seen through the lies and deceit of Aaron Mann in his attempt to minimise his responsibility for the brutal murder of our daughter Claire,' the couple said in a statement issued through Warwickshire Police. 'His suggestion that “voices told him to do it”, were in our opinion completely fabricated. 'Claire had decided to split up from Mann, but she was murdered before she had a chance to leave him. 'We. have had to live with the terrible consequence of Mann’s murder of our. daughter, the details of which have been both shocking and graphic. 'At. no stage has Mann shown any remorse whatsoever and his account of how. he murdered Claire is quite the worst thing any parent could possibly. imagine. 'At least we now know. that while he is in prison other parents can know that their daughters. will not be exposed to this evil killer.' Ms O'Connor's son Daniel wrote on Facebook following yesterday's verdict: 'It’s a result but don’t bring her back. Rot in hell!' Scene: Forensic investigators descended on the couple's home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, in the wake of Ms O'Connor's murder in the early hours of New Year's Day last year. 'Difficult': Bouncer Mann was convicted of murder and told he must serve at least 16 years in prison following a week-long trial. Detective Chief Inspector James Essex, from Warwickshire Police, said the force was pleased with the outcome of the trial. 'This has been a particularly difficult trial for Claire’s family and friends,' he said. 'Unfortunately domestic abuse is largely a hidden crime that all too often takes place behind closed doors. Often no one other than those directly involved, know it is taking place. 'Sadly it is too late for Claire, but I am urging anyone who suffers from domestic abuse, in whatever form, be it physical, psychological, sexual, financial or emotional, to seek help from the police or other support agencies. 'The message to anyone affected by domestic abuse is that you do not have to put up with the abuse and you don’t have to cope on your own. 'There are people who can help, people who can listen and who can provide you with support.' The court heard throughout the trial how Mann was driven to jealousy after seeing Ms O'Connor socialising with other people, and she had told him their relationship was over. Mark Wall QC, prosecuting, said the attack occurred on January 1 after the pair returned from a pub called the Green Bear, near their home in Nuneaton. Mr Wall said: 'They returned home at around 12.30am and Mann killed Claire by applying such force to her neck as to asphyxiate her. 'A pathologist found other injuries as a result of the attack, including a broken jaw and two broken ribs. 'There can be no doubt that what Mann did was a significant attack, which was intended to either kill her or cause her very serious injury.' Mr Wall added that the pair’s relationship 'had not run smooth' and that the previous spring Ms O'Connor had gone to the police to report violence and threats against her by Mann. Giving evidence to the court himself, Mann - who had already admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - demonstrated how he had gripped her neck and put a pillow over her face. He added: 'The voices told me to finish her off'. Prosecution psychiatrists dismissed Mann’s claims he had an acute psychotic illness - finding he had been perfectly 'rational' and careful in trying to cover his tracks. Mann's medical records - which included frequent visits to doctors and psychiatrists since 2009 - had made no mention of hearing voices. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Which language is this?","completion":"The given sentence, \\"La séance est levée à 11 heures,\\" is in French. It translates to \\"The session is adjourned at 11 o'clock\\" in English. French is a Romance language that originated from Latin and is spoken in various countries and regions worldwide, including France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada (mainly in Quebec), some African and Caribbean countries, as well as other smaller communities throughout the globe. French has a rich history, dating back to the Roman Empire when it was known as Vulgar Latin. Over the centuries, the language has evolved through several stages: Old French (9th to 13th century), Middle French (14th to 16th century), and Modern French (17th century to present). The Académie française was founded in 1635, with the mission to standardize and protect French grammar, vocabulary, and usage, as well as promote the French language's development. Notably, French has a significant influence on other languages too. It played a major role in the development of vernacular languages during the Middle Ages and had an extensive impact on the English language after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. French has also contributed many loanwords to English. Today, French is the sixth most spoken language worldwide, with about 274 million speakers. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations and the second most studied language after English. French is a valuable language in the global community, fostering communications and cultural exchanges among different countries and regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite supporters' hopes that this time it's different, President Barack Obama's new call for restricting some semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines will face deeply entrenched resistance in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and could be a long shot even in the Democratic-led Senate. Any gun legislation sent to the House \\"is going to have to pass with most Democrats and a few Republicans,\\" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. \\"This would be an even more high-profile bill.\\" Read the proposals. And Obama's call for Congress to reinstate the federal ban on military-style rifles that expired in 2004 \\"is a further reach than some of the other proposals that are being tossed around,\\" Gonzales said. \\"There is no way that it is going to pass with a majority of Republican support,\\" he said. \\"That is just the reality of the situation. It is going to take virtually all the Democrats, and all the Democrats won't vote for that.\\" Obama and Vice President Joe Biden laid out a package of measures aimed at reducing gun violence Wednesday, just over a month after the December massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. The killings of 26 people there followed a July rampage in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, that left 12 dead and the August attack on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed another six. \\"The world has changed, and it's demanding action,\\" said Biden, who led a White House task force on gun violence after the Connecticut slayings. But before the announcement, local officials in at least three states vowed to resist any new gun controls. And Second Amendment fans have poured out their vituperation online, some floridly warning of a power grab by the Obama administration. A look at U.S. gun laws. Texas state Rep. Steve Toth told CNN on Wednesday that he'll introduce legislation that would make it illegal to enforce a federal gun ban. \\"We're going to do everything we can to call people back to the belief and the understanding that we're a constitutional republic and that our rights do not come from Congress,\\" he said. \\"Our rights come from God and are enumerated in the Constitution.\\" And in a video that spread virally across the Internet, the head of a Tennessee gun training and accessory company warned \\"all you patriots\\" to \\"get ready to fight\\" if the Obama administration took steps to restrict firearms. \\"I am not letting my country be ruled by a dictator. I'm not letting anybody take my guns. If it goes one inch further, I'm gonna start killing people,\\" Tactical Response CEO James Yeager vowed. In a later video, in which he's accompanied by his attorney, Yeager apologized \\"for letting my anger get the better of me\\" and cautioned viewers, \\"It's not time for any type of violent action.\\" Opinion: NRA's paranoid fantasy. Obama on Wednesday signed 23 orders that don't require congressional approval that he said would stiffen background checks on gun buyers and expand safety programs in schools. And he called on Congress to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds and to require a background check for anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale or gun show. The steps that require legislative action are likely to bump up against the often-visceral opposition of lawmakers from conservative districts -- and some of their more outspoken constituents. Most Republicans in the House of Representatives have top rankings from the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun-rights lobby, which quickly criticized the White House plans. But it's not just Republicans: Many Democrats, particularly in the conservative South and rural West, are vocal gun-rights supporters as well. \\"Guns have been one of the key issues that more moderate Democrats have used to express their independence from the Democratic Party, and this gun talk is putting a strain on that independence,\\" Gonzales said. Though they might be willing to support proposals such as a ban on large-capacity magazines, they're unlikely to vote to ban \\"an actual gun,\\" he said. CNN/Time Poll: Slight dip in support for gun control measures in last month. \\"You can just see the ads -- 'They are taking guns away' -- where with these other items it is different,\\" Gonzales said. Even in the Senate, where Democrats control the chamber, Democratic leadership sources told CNN that passing any new legislation will be extremely difficult. More than a dozen vulnerable Democrats from conservative states will likely resist much of what the president is pushing, the sources said. Those sources say they have no intention of putting their members in politically vulnerable position on a gun measure unless they are sure it can reach the president's desk. That means not only getting enough red-state Democrats on board, but getting enough Republicans to break a possible GOP filibuster. But Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, said the tide appears to have shifted in favor of gun control after the Connecticut killings. A CNN/Time magazine/ORC International poll released Wednesday found 55% of Americans generally favor stricter gun control laws, with 56% saying that it's currently too easy to buy guns in this country -- but only 39% say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves. McCarthy said Senate approval \\"might even give some members of Congress the spine to do the right thing.\\" \\"You know, the NRA is not in line with an awful lot of their members, and that is something we're counting on to go forward,\\" said McCarthy, whose husband was among the six killed when a deranged gunman opened fire on a Long Island commuter train in 1993. December's killings have \\"gone to the heart of every mother, father, grandparent thinking about their children, grandchildren. We have to do something,\\" she added. Opinion: Gun control -- it's on all of us. CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article discusses the difficulty faced by former President Barack Obama in implementing gun control legislation, specifically restrictions on some semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines. The opposition is identified to be deeply rooted in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and potentially within the Democratic-led Senate as well. Key points highlighted in the article are: 1. Obama's recommendation for Congress to reinstate the federal ban on military-style rifles (which expired in 2004) is believed to be unlikely to pass with a majority of Republican support, according to Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. 2. President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden proposed a series of measures to reduce gun violence in response to several tragedies, like the Connecticut school shooting in 2012. 3. Local officials in several states, as well as Second Amendment supporters, expressed resistance to new gun controls. For example, Texas state Rep. Steve Toth planned to introduce legislation making it illegal to enforce a federal gun ban, and a Tennessee gun training company's CEO warned of resistance to any further gun restrictions. 4. President Obama signed 23 executive orders to enhance background checks on gun buyers and expand safety programs in schools, bypassing the need for congressional approval. He also asked Congress to restrict ammunition magazines to 10 rounds maximum and to require background checks for all gun purchases. 5. The implementation of gun control measures met with strong resistance from the majority of Republicans, many of whom received top rankings from the National Rifle Association (NRA). However, the opposition was not limited to Republicans; Number of Democrats from conservative regions also stood as gun-rights supporters. 6. Even within the Democratic-controlled Senate, passing new legislation was anticipated to be challenging due to opposition from vulnerable Democrats from conservative states, along with a potential Republican filibuster. 7. Despite the challenges, some like Rep. Carolyn McCarthy believed there was increased public support for gun control after the Connecticut shooting. McCarthy, whose husband was killed in a separate incident by a gunman in 1993, argued that the NRA’s stance differed from those of many of its members. The article conveys the overarching challenge to gun-control measures in the US due to deeply-rooted political divides and powerful lobbying groups like the NRA."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have two parts with r in them: 5956*r and -5965*r. We can put them together like this: (5956*r - 5965*r) + 81 = 0 Now, let's find out what 5956 minus 5965 is! 5956 - 5965 = -9 So that changes our equation to: (-9*r) + 81 = 0 Next, we need to get rid of the 81 on one side. We can do that by subtracting 81 from both sides: -9*r + 81 - 81 = 0 - 81 That gives us: -9*r = -81 Now we just need to find out what number times -9 gives us -81. So we can divide both sides by -9: -9*r / -9 = -81 / -9 That simplifies to: r = 9 So, our solution for the equation is r = 9!

Health Care Ad Battle The Times’s Abby Goodnough reported today that right-wing groups have spent 235 million on ads attacking President Obama’s health-care law — and seem to have gotten their money’s worth. People hate the law, they don’t understand it, they think it’s something that will hurt, oppress and bankrupt them — even when it won’t. People like Erika Losse, a part-time worker in her mid-30s with no health insurance, who pays out of pocket for care and would probably qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. She told Abby, “I’m positive I can’t afford it.” Actually, what she can’t afford is insurance without the ACA. The article explains that spending on the other side has been minuscule — that there are very few ads sticking up for the law, and those that try to do so are lame. “Did you know with your health insurance, you may now have some preventive benefits with no co-pays or out-of-pocket costs?” asks one ad from the Department of Health and Human Services. Using such tentative, even-keeled language is the equivalent of pulling out a knife in a gunfight. The pro-health care side talks of “some preventive benefits” while the antagonists call Obamacare a socialist-rationing-Canadian scheme to destroy freedoms, bankrupt society and hasten early death. Wasn’t that why Natasha Richardson died in a skiing accident — because it happened in CANADA? The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the law, which has been the signature domestic achievement of Mr. Obama’s presidency.

Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first rank , then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed. Castling may only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check. Castling is one of the rules of chess and is technically a king move (Hooper & Whyld 1992:71). Can we conclude that is it legal to castle out of check?","completion":"No, it is not legal to castle out of check in chess. As per the rules and conditions set for castling, one of the key requirements is that the king must not be in check when attempting the move. There are a few important conditions to keep in mind when considering the legality of castling: 1. The king and the rook involved in castling should not have moved previously in the game. 2. All the squares between the king and the rook must be unoccupied. 3. The king must not currently be in check. 4. The squares the king will cross over during castling should not be under attack, meaning the king would not be in check during the process of castling. 5. The final position of the king after castling should not be in check. If any of these conditions are not met, castling is deemed illegal and cannot be executed during the game. In the case of a king being in check, the player must make another legal move to remove their king from the threat instead of attempting to castle. This often involves moving the king, blocking the check with another piece, or capturing the attacking piece. Once a player executes a legal move to get out of check, they may later consider castling, assuming all other conditions are met. However, it is essential to remember that if the king has moved to get out of check, castling is no longer possible, as one condition for castling is that the king must not have moved previously in the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Sugar--free beets that still taste sweet, tastier tomatoes and brighter-colored fruits and vegetables that stay ripe longer are all foods that are being grown now. How can they carry traits, such as being tastier, brighter, and riper? They are genetically engineered. Genetic engineering is like making a change in a recipe. For example, when you make cakes, you mix together all of the usual ingredients. If you add an extra ingredient, like salt, the cakes will taste differently. Genes are ingredients in the recipe for life. They carry the traits of living things. Your genes dictate what color hair and eyes you'll have, how tall you'll be, as well as many other traits. Genes carry traits for plants, too. By adding genes to a plant, you can sometimes create new traits. For example, adding a certain gene to a potato plant can make the potato plant distasteful to bugs . This makes some farmers happy because they don't have to use chemicals to keep bugs away from their plants. It sounds great, but some people are opposed to the idea of food that is genetically engineered. Ronnie Cummins, from the Campaign for Food Safety, is against it. He says that one of the major concerns is allergies . Supermarkets don't always label foods that are genetically engineered. A customer could unknowingly buy food that has an added gene from another plant that he or she is allergic to. It could be dangerous. Gary Burton from Monsanto, a seed company that engineers food, disagrees. He says his company tests for allergies. Burton believes that genetic engineering is a valuable tool for making better food. The technology can help farmers use less insecticide and grow healthier crops. Burton thinks there are many advantages. But Cummins says that we just don't know what will happen in the future if we keep adding genes to foods. We could mistakenly create a monster. People have different opinions about genetic engineering. One side supports it and thinks it will only help us. The other side is opposed to playing with nature and fears...

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian... answer the following question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis?

Options: - being happy - glee - smoke - stress relief - may laugh The answer is \\"may laugh\\" because Answer:","completion":"When someone is having fun, they are likely engaging in activities that bring them joy and amusement. While the options listed provide various emotional states and actions associated with joy, the answer \\"may laugh\\" best captures a direct reaction to having fun. - Being happy: This is an emotional state that a person experiences while having fun, but it doesn't necessarily describe a specific action or reaction to fun activities. - Glee: Similar to being happy, glee is a feeling of great delight or pleasure, which could be experienced while having fun. However, once again, it's not an action or reaction to fun activities on its own. - Smoke: While some people might smoke for stress relief or as part of their socializing activities, it is not directly related to having fun itself and not everyone who has fun would engage in smoking. - Stress relief: Having fun can indeed provide stress relief, as it takes the person's mind off their problems and helps them relax. However, stress relief is a consequence of having fun, rather than an action or response to fun activities. - May laugh: Laughter is a natural reaction and expression of joy experienced when someone is having fun. It reflects the amusement and lightheartedness of engaging in enjoyable activities, making it the most accurate answer to the question of what someone might do while having fun."},{"prompt":"What key details about johanna konta can be extracted from the following bio?

Identify the purpose and specifications: Begin by determining the specific requirements of the smartphone holder. This could include factors such as the size of the smartphone, the method of attachment to the seat or tray table, and any additional features such as charging capabilities or adjustability. 2. Gather necessary materials and tools: You will need various materials and tools to create a smartphone holder. Some common materials include: - A sturdy, lightweight material like plastic or aluminum for the main structure - Velcro or straps for attaching the holder to the seat or tray table - A soft material like silicone or foam to provide cushioning for the smartphone - Screws, nuts, or adhesive for securing the parts together Tools might include a drill, screwdriver, saw, or cutting tool, ruler, and pencil. 3. Create a design: Sketch a rough design of your smartphone holder, including measurements and dimensions. This should include the attachment method (e.g., Velcro straps) and any other features such as an adjustable angle or built-in charger. 4.

Question: If Mona's country normally emits a lot of greenhouse gas, but one day decides to lower the amount they emit, what will happen to the global temperature? Answer: decrease Output:","completion":"In order to provide an explanation for the given question and answer, it is essential to first understand the role of greenhouse gases in global temperature regulation. Step 1: Understand the context Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, play a significant role in trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which maintains the planet's overall temperature. This process, known as the greenhouse effect, is vital for sustaining life on Earth. However, an excess of greenhouse gases can lead to global warming, resulting in detrimental environmental consequences. Step 2: Assess the question The question asks about the potential consequences of Mona's country, which is known for emitting high levels of greenhouse gas, taking action to reduce the amount they emit. The goal is to identify how this reduction would affect global temperature. Step 3: Analyze the answer According to the given answer, if Mona's country reduces their greenhouse gas emissions, the global temperature will decrease. Step 4: Provide the explanation Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a country that usually has high emission levels can have a positive impact on the global temperature. By lowering their emissions, the country can contribute to mitigating the greenhouse effect, leading to a reduction in trapped heat within the Earth's atmosphere. Consequently, this would result in a decrease in the overall global temperature, counteracting the adverse effects of global warming and helping to maintain a stable climate. Output: If Mona's country, known for emitting high levels of greenhouse gases, decides to reduce their emissions, this would contribute to mitigating the greenhouse effect. As a result, less heat would be trapped within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a decrease in the overall global temperature.

In the period between the two world wars, the Danish navy had low priority for the politicians, especially between 1929 and 1942 under Thorvald Stauning. During the first year of the German occupation , the navy assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and, on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral A. H. Vedel \\"to try to flee to the nearest neutral or nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible, the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible\\". The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships. A number of vessels had been ordered to attempt to escape to Swedish waters, and 13 succeeded. The fleet flagship, Niels Juel, attempted to break out in the Battle of Isefjord but the crew was forced to beach and partly scuttle her. The score for the larger vessels was therefore: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were in Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans. As for the smaller vessels: 9 \\"patruljekuttere\\" reached Sweden, 50 others were captured by the Germans. By the autumn of 1944, these ships officially formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile. In September 1943, A. H. Vedel was fired by order of the prime minister Vilhelm Buhl because of his hostile actions towards the Germans. How many years was the Danish navy neglected by the Danish politicians?","completion":"The Danish navy was neglected by the Danish politicians, especially between 1929 and 1942 under Thorvald Stauning. To determine the number of years: 1. Identify the starting year: 1929 2. Identify the ending year: 1942 3.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What year did the composer in a creative struggle perform a concert? Answer the above question based on the context below: With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an \\"enemy national\\", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being \\"less than loyal subjects of the Tsar\\". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself \\"forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness\\".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a \\"major work\\" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, \\"My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg\\". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (\\"I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come\\".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an \\"artist on tour\\", feeding...

Here are possible answers to this question: - laboratory - restaurant - freezer - grocery store - laboratory I believe the correct choice is \\"freezer\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice for cold storage when you have just bought some food would indeed be a \\"freezer\\". A freezer is specifically designed to store food at a low temperature to preserve its freshness and prevent spoilage. Here's a detailed explanation of each option and why the freezer is the best choice: 1. Laboratory: A laboratory is a place where scientific research and experiments are conducted. It is not a suitable environment for storing food, especially since laboratories often contain hazardous materials and chemicals that may pose a risk of contamination. Moreover, laboratories are designed for scientific purposes and not for food storage, so they lack the necessary infrastructure to store food products properly. 2. Restaurant: A restaurant is a place where food is prepared, cooked, and served to customers. While restaurants do have cold storage facilities like refrigerators to store their raw ingredients, it is not an ideal place to store the food you've just bought, as these facilities are reserved for the restaurant's use. Additionally, storing your food in a restaurant would not be convenient for you, as you would have to go to the restaurant every time you need to access your stored food items. 3. Freezer: A freezer is an appliance specifically designed for cold storage of food items at low temperatures, usually below 0°C (32°F). Freezers come in various sizes, including large stand-alone units and smaller compartments within a refrigerator. Storing your food in a freezer ensures that it remains fresh by preventing the growth of bacteria and the natural decomposition process that occurs at room temperature. Different food items have different ideal storage conditions, making it important to read the product label or consult a food storage guide to know the specific temperature requirements for your purchased food items. 4. Grocery Store: A grocery store is a place where you buy food and other household items, not a place where you'd store your food after purchase. Though grocery stores have cold storage facilities, such as refrigerated aisles and walk-in freezers, these are for the store's inventory only, not for personal storage use. 5. Laboratory (repeated): As mentioned earlier, a laboratory is not a suitable place for food storage due to its primary function being scientific research and the potential risk of contamination from hazardous materials. So, in conclusion, a freezer is indeed the correct and most appropriate choice for cold storage when you have just bought some food. By using a freezer, you can ensure that your food remains fresh, safe, and ready for consumption. Make sure to follow proper food storage guidelines and temperature settings to get the best results and prolong the shelf life of your food items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The Ottoman Empire lost a battle to Albania before the Battle of Mokra. The Battle of Mokra took place on October 10, 1445 near mountain Mokra (today in Makedonski Brod, Macedonia). It was an Ottoman retaliation to a message sent by Skanderbeg to Murad II. The Albanian forces under Skanderbeg defeated the Ottoman forces under Firuz Pasha. It was the second major Albanian victory over the Ottoman Empire.","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the information given in the text. From the text, we have the following relevant information: - The Battle of Mokra occurred on October 10, 1445. - Skanderbeg led the Albanian forces. - The Albanian forces defeated the Ottoman forces. - It was the second major Albanian victory over the Ottoman Empire. Step 2: Look for information about a previous battle between the Ottoman Empire and Albania. In the given text, no direct information is provided about a previous battle between the Ottoman Empire and Albania. However, it mentions that the Battle of Mokra was the second major Albanian victory over the Ottoman Empire. Step 3: Reason based on available information. As there is no specific information about a previous battle between the Ottoman Empire and Albania in the given text, we must rely on inferences from the available information. Considering the Battle of Mokra was the second major Albanian victory, it is reasonable to assume that there was at least one battle before this one where the Albanian forces emerged victorious. Step 4: Arrive at a conclusion. Based on the above reasoning and information, it can be inferred that the sentence \\"The Ottoman Empire lost a battle to Albania before the Battle of Mokra\\" is most likely true, as there was at least one major victory for Albania preceding the Battle of Mokra."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The water freezes into ice - The cracks expand - Over time the rocks split - The rocks are now in smaller pieces.

If \\"A child sings into a loofa in the bathtub\\", does it logically follow that \\"The loofa was just used to clean his butt.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"The loofa was just used to clean his butt\\" simply because \\"A child sings into a loofa in the bathtub.\\" While there could be an instance in which the loofa was used for that specific purpose, it is not inherently implied nor explicitly stated in the given scenario. There are several reasons why it's not logical to assume that the loofa was just used to clean the child's butt: 1. Lack of explicit information: The given statement only mentions a child singing into a loofa while being in the bathtub. It doesn't provide any specific details about how the loofa was used or for what purpose it was employed before the child started singing into it. 2. Other uses of the loofa: A loofa can be used for various cleaning purposes, such as washing body parts other than the butt, scrubbing the bathtub, or even playing with it like a toy while in the bathtub. Therefore, without additional information, it would be incorrect to make any assumptions about the use of the loofa. 3. The child might not have used the loofa at all: It is entirely possible that the child simply picked up the loofa to sing into it, without having used it for any cleaning purposes. In this case, the loofa may have been in the bathtub for reasons unrelated to the child or for other bath-time activities. 4. Different timing: The loofa might have been used to clean the child's butt in the past, but not necessarily immediately prior to the child singing into it. For instance, it may have been used earlier in the bath for cleaning purposes, and then the child started playing with it later. 5. Other individuals: There could be other individuals, such as a parent or a sibling, involved in the situation who might have used the loofa for cleaning purposes. The statement only states a child singing into the loofa, so it is unknown whether the child or someone else has used the loofa recently. The key point to recognize is that the given statement does not provide enough information to support the assumption that the loofa was just used to clean the child's butt. It is important to refrain from making assumptions or drawing conclusions without clear and sufficient evidence. In summary, while it is possible that the loofa was used to clean the child's butt, it does not logically follow from the statement \\"A child sings into a loofa in the bathtub.\\" There are various scenarios in which the loofa may have been used differently or not at all, and additional information would be necessary to determine its recent function with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Write some highlights for the following article: France's reputation as rugby's Jekyll and Hyde team was reaffirmed on Saturday as Marc Lievremont's inconsistent side bounced back from two defeats to eliminate England and reach the World Cup semifinals. Les Bleus avenged their 2007 semi defeat by the English on home soil with a 19-12 victory in Auckland, setting up a last-four clash with Wales -- who went through after beating Celtic neighbors Ireland 22-10. With the other half of the drawing pitting hosts New Zealand against Argentina, and world champions South Africa versus Australia -- both games are on Sunday -- there could potentially be a repeat of the inaugural 1987 final when the All Blacks beat France. Coach Lievremont will be replaced by Philippe Saint-Andre after the tournament, but he has the chance to help France to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time. His team lost to New Zealand and Tonga in the group stage, but roared to a 16-0 halftime lead at Eden Park as wing Vincent Clerc and fullback Maxime Medard crossed for tries, while Dimitri Yachvili kicked two penalties. England, the 2003 champions, rallied with second-half tries to fullback Ben Foden and wing Mark Cueto but a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc in between those scores kept France safely ahead. \\"You can't give a good team like France 16 points of a start. We had chances in the second half but they deserved to win,\\" said England manager Martin Johnson, a World Cup winner as a player eight years ago. France captain Thierry Dusautoir was glad to put the nightmare of the shock Tonga defeat behind him. \\"We didn't want to go out like this. We wanted to show how we can play rugby,\\" he said. \\"I think we did it well. It was a great start for us and we are going to enjoy this victory. Now we need to keep it up and focus on the next game.\\" The French will take on Wales at Eden Park next Saturday after Warren Gatland's team handed Ireland a first defeat of the tournament to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1987. The Group D runners-up scored three tries to one in Wellington as Ireland failed to capitalize on a wealth of first-half possession and crashed out at the last-eight stage for the fifth successive time. Veteran winger Shane Williams put Wales ahead with a third-minute try that young flyhalf Rhys Priestland converted for a 10-3 lead at the break. Ronan O'Gara kicked Ireland's only points with a 24th-minute penalty before Leigh Halfpenny replied in kind just before the half hour. Ireland leveled five minutes after the interval as O'Gara converted a try by wing Keith Earls, but Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips dotted down in the 51st minute and center Jonathan Davies made it safe on 64. \\"We spent a lot of time in that first half in their 22 and we only came up with three points in the half,\\" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll said. \\"It hurts a bit when you're going in at halftime having the opportunities and knocking on the door, but not really getting any points out of the territory. \\"We needed to deliver a performance similar to the one against Australia or the one against Italy last week. We didn't do that today, we knocked on way too much ball.\\" Gatland backed his young team to go further in the tournament. \\"They have no baggage and there's no fear factor,\\" Gatland said. \\"We are in New Zealand and not in the bubble of Wales and listening to any of the negativity that is sometimes generated back home. \\"We've worked so hard in the last three, four months.

Kayla uses knowledge and experience to help Elena grow in life because Available options: (A). Kayla was a child. (B). Elena was a child.","completion":"Kayla uses knowledge and experience to help Elena grow in life because (B). Elena was a child. Step 1: Understand the context To continue writing the text, I need to understand the context provided. The focus is on Kayla's efforts to help Elena grow in life, using her own knowledge and experience. The provided options suggest a comparison to childhood: either Kayla's or Elena's. Step 2: Choose the appropriate option In this case, it makes more sense to choose option (B) since we're discussing Elena's growth in life. Both options connect the focus of the text back to childhood experiences, but option (B) is more relevant to Elena's growth. Step 3: Expand on the chosen option Now, I will expand on how the fact that Elena was a child can support the main idea of Kayla using her knowledge and experience to help her grow. As a child, Elena had a natural curiosity and desire to learn, seeking new experiences and challenges. Kayla, being older and more experienced, recognized these qualities in Elena and decided to help her develop her skills and talents further. Kayla drew from her own experiences, both as a child with similar interests and as an adult who had overcome many challenges and built a successful career. Step 4: Provide examples or anecdotes To make the text more engaging and relatable, I'll include an example or anecdote that illustrates Kayla's knowledge and experience helping Elena to grow. One day, Elena came to Kayla with a problem she couldn't quite solve on her own. She loved painting, but was struggling to master the art of blending colors. Kayla, an accomplished painter herself, shared her own struggles from when she was just starting out: how she too had once faced similar challenges and had learned to overcome them through perseverance and practice. With patience and understanding, Kayla demonstrated various blending techniques and encouraged Elena to practice regularly. Over time, Elena's skills improved immensely, all thanks to Kayla's guidance and expertise. Step 5: Conclude the text To wrap up, bring the focus back to the main idea and emphasize the importance of the knowledge and experience Kayla shared with Elena. In conclusion, Kayla's knowledge and experience played a crucial role in Elena's growth, particularly because Elena was a child still discovering her abilities and shaping her future. By offering guidance, support, and sharing her own stories of growth and learning, Kayla successfully helped nurture Elena's talents and inspire her to continue learning and growing throughout her life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who participates as a cheerleader? Movie plot title: MASH Movie plot: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions; Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John form one faction; all three were drafted into the army and are not as dedicated to the mission or lifestyle of the military. They are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. The other faction forms around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns, who are both career military personnel. The two factions battle back and forth in a series of pranks and reprisals (one involving exposing a naked Houlihan to the camp when the walls of the shower tent are collapsed, another embarrassing the couple by exposing their heretofore secret romance) until Burns is goaded into punching Hawkeye and removed from the unit for...

Given the context: How would you describe Austin? A:","completion":"In order to provide a detailed description of Austin, let us first examine the situation at hand. Austin presented Sydney with a choice between attending a party or spending the night studying. It is essential to consider the context and the potential reasons behind Austin's motives, as well as the consequences of Sydney's decision. Option A: Austin cares about Sydney's academic success. Austin could be described as a caring and supportive friend who is focused on ensuring Sydney's academic success and long-term goals. By giving Sydney the option to choose between a party and studying, Austin encourages Sydney to prioritize their responsibilities and weigh the pros and cons of each choice. Austin may understand the importance of achieving a balance between work and play, acknowledging that some opportunities for leisure and socializing can positively impact one's emotional well-being. Option B: Austin is trying to control Sydney's decisions. It is also possible that Austin may be attempting to exert control over Sydney's life choices and limit their freedom. Presenting Sydney with a choice between a party and studying might be a subtle way of manipulating them into considering the consequences of their actions. In this case, Austin could be described as controlling, manipulative, and possibly overbearing. Option C: Austin is helping Sydney develop decision-making skills. On the other hand, Austin could be perceived as a mentor or guide who aims to help Sydney develop essential decision-making skills and strong personal values. By facilitating a choice between two conflicting options, Austin engages Sydney in a problem-solving process that will ultimately strengthen their ability to make independent decisions. Thus, Austin could be characterized as nurturing, wise, and supportive, with a focus on Sydney's growth and personal development. Option D: Austin is testing their influence on Sydney. Finally, Austin might be curious about the extent of their influence over Sydney. By presenting Sydney with a choice between two contrasting options, Austin could be gauging how obedient or agreeable Sydney's personality is and how likely they are to follow Austin's suggestions or succumb to peer pressure. In this context, Austin can be seen as calculating, cunning, and analytical. In summary, based on the given context, Austin can be described in several ways, including being caring and supportive, controlling and manipulative, nurturing and wise, or calculating and analytical. The actual description of Austin's personality and motives largely depends upon the underlying reasons for presenting Sydney with the choice and the outcomes of that decision. Without more information, it is difficult to pinpoint which description is the most accurate representation of Austin's character."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Before you start looking at hosting plans, you'll need a good idea of your basic needs. Use this list of questions as a guide for determining the type of service that will best suit your website: Do you have, need, or want your own domain name? Do you have (or want) a blog? Do you need a specific blogging platform (e.g., Wordpress)? Are you tech-savvy or a beginner? If you're not a developer, you might consider a host like Squarespace, Wix, or Weebly. These hosts make it easy to create a stylish personal or professional site without any technical know-how. Do you really need a paid webhost or could you get by with a free option? If you plan to have a personal blog without your own domain name, consider free options like Tumblr, Blogger, or Wordpress.com. Do you rely on (or want) a visual panel like cPanel to install software and updates? Do you need to migrate an existing website to a new host? If so, does your site require specific tools (a certain blogging platform, support for certain types of apps, etc.) to run? Do you need to be able to sell products or services and take payments? Web hosts often charge different rates depending on how much traffic your site gets and how much space your content takes up. Is your business expanding? Do you foresee a significant increase in visitors? There's a chance that what works for you now will need to be scaled up in the near future. When choosing a web host, keep the future in mind and plan accordingly. If you have access to your current website's statistics, use that information to gauge growth. There are three general types of plans offered by web hosts: Shared hosting: Shared hosting is great for personal websites, bloggers whose sites are mostly text-based, and small businesses who use external ecommerce sites like Shopify or Etsy to handle their sales. Your website will be hosted on a server that also hosts other peoples' websites, which means you'll be sharing resources, such as bandwidth, hard-drive space, CPU power, and RAM. As the most affordable and user-friendly type of web hosting, shared hosting plans typically offer website-building tools, one-click management panels, and limited support. Many shared plans also come with a free domain name. Bandwidth and hard drive space are limited. If a shared server becomes overcrowded or hosts resource-intensive websites, your site's performance may suffer. Dedicated hosting: Dedicated hosting is ideal for large businesses with server administrators, as well as high-traffic/resource-intensive websites with lots of customization needs. With this type of hosting, you'll have an entire server dedicated to your website. You'll control every aspect of your website, including maintaining all applications and databases relied on by your website. You'll also be responsible for ensuring that your server is secure, patched, and up-to-date. If you don't have a server admin and aren't technical yourself, you'll need a \\"managed\\" service plan, which can be pricey. Virtual Private Servers: This plan is recommended for businesses whose sites rely on more customization than what's available on a shared server, but don't require as much bandwidth or storage space as what comes with a dedicated server. VPS service is similar to dedicated hosting in that you'll have your own operating system and the ability to manage all aspects of your server's backend tools. It's also similar to a shared server because you'll be sharing the physical hardware with other customers. Like a dedicated server, you'll need advanced technical know-how (or a managed support plan) to build and maintain your site. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: Before choosing a web hosting plan, consider your needs by asking questions such as whether you need your own domain name, a blog, specific blogging platforms, or paid/free web hosting. Keep in mind your technical skills, traffic expectations, and potential growth. There are three general types of hosting plans: Shared hosting, which is affordable and great for personal websites and small businesses; Dedicated hosting, ideal for large businesses or high-traffic websites requiring customization and server administration; and Virtual Private Servers (VPS), suitable for businesses needing more customization but with lesser traffic or storage needs.

Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. Which milk would be coagulated, bottle A or bottle B? Hint: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bottle B milk would be coagulated. Dan made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk, which involves the process of coagulation. The milk in bottle A has been kept intact, meaning it has not undergone any coagulation process to form curds. The process of curdling, as mentioned in the hint, involves adding an edible acidic substance or allowing the milk to sour, which causes the milk proteins to tangle and form solid masses or curds.
