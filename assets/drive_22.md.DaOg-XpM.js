Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these sentences essentially mean the same thing. Let me break down the steps to justify my conclusion: Step 1: Identify the main ideas in both sentences. Sentence 1: Shae Lappen and Dan Mena discussed forming a new band with Brendan Benham after their previous band's breakup. Sentence 2: Shae Lappen and Dan Mena discussed founding a new band with Brendan Benham after their previous band's separation. Step 2: Compare the main ideas. Both sentences convey that Shae Lappen and Dan Mena had a discussion with Brendan Benham about starting a new band after the dissolution of their previous band. Step 3: Analyze synonyms and vocabulary. The terms \\"breakup\\" and \\"separation\\" are used synonymously in both sentences to represent the end of their previous band. In Sentence 1, \\"forming a new band\\" is used, while in Sentence 2, \\"founding a new band\\" is used. Both phrases indicate the same action—starting or creating a new band. Considering the similarities in the main ideas, vocabulary, and synonymous terms used, I conclude that these sentences mean the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, group Alpha experienced mild allergy symptoms, while group Beta continued experiencing severe allergy symptoms and remained hospitalized. Which group experienced a runny nose? Hint: Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that group Alpha, who experienced mild allergy symptoms, experienced a runny nose. This conclusion can be drawn from the details given in the hint, which specify that mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Since group Alpha's response to the new allergy medicine was characterized as mild, it can be inferred that they encountered one or more of these described symptoms. In contrast, group Beta continued to suffer from severe allergy symptoms, resulting in their hospitalization. Severe symptoms typically involve difficulty breathing and can be life-threatening, as mentioned in the hint. Although it is possible that group Beta also experienced a runny nose, the focus for them was likely on more severe and dangerous signs of allergies. It is important to note that in both groups, the immune system is responsible for the symptoms experienced, rather than the allergen itself. In both mild and severe cases, the immune system overreacts to the allergen, triggering symptoms that manifest either as mild annoyances or severe reactions requiring medical intervention. The newly discovered allergy medicine seemed to have had differing levels of efficacy for the two groups – while it lessened group Alpha's symptoms to a milder state, it failed to provide significant relief to group Beta, whose members remained hospitalized. This could indicate that the medication may be more effective for certain individuals or types of allergies, or that some cases may be more resistant to treatment. In summary, it is likely that group Alpha experienced a runny nose, as mild symptoms including a runny nose were observed in their response to the allergy medication. In contrast, group Beta's focus was on their severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms, with the possibility of a runny nose being a secondary concern."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At least 65 people have been found dead, all apparently shot in the head, and all with their arms tied behind their backs, Reuters reports. The death toll could rise as high as 80, the rights group said. It's unclear which faction in the country's ongoing civil war killed them. The incident comes as Syrian rebels scored a major victory today, taking a government intelligence compound in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor after five days of fighting, and freeing at least 11 prisoners held within, the AP reports. The government responded with a series of airstrikes in an attempt to drive the rebels out. According to Reuters, the rebels included fighters from the al-Nusra Front, an Islamist group with ties to al-Qaeda. Expand this summary.","completion":"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported a devastating event it refers to as a \\"new massacre\\" taking place near Aleppo, a city in Syria, raising concerns about the ongoing violence and turmoil in the region. The death toll from the massacre is estimated to be at least 65 people, with the possibility of rising as high as 80 individual fatalities. Tragically, all victims seemed to have been shot in the head, with their hands bound behind their backs, indicating a cruel and targeted execution. At this time, it remains uncertain which faction, or group, involved in Syria's ongoing civil conflict is responsible for the killings. The civil war, which began in 2011, has continued to cause widespread destruction and suffering among the Syrian population. In addition to the heinous atrocities occurring near Aleppo, Syrian rebels have recently achieved a significant victory, taking control of a government intelligence compound located in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor. The seizure of the compound took five days of relentless fighting, culminating in the successful release of at least 11 prisoners who had been detained within the facility. News agencies, such as Reuters, reveal that the rebels comprised various groups, including fighters from the al-Nusra Front, an Islamist organization with known connections to al-Qaeda. This group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, the United States, and other countries, and is suspected of playing a role in various acts of violence throughout Syria. In response to the rebel's advances, the Syrian government launched a series of airstrikes to counter the attacks and regain control of the lost territories. However, the outcome of these efforts remains unclear, as both sides continue to wrestle for dominance across the country. As the civil war in Syria enters its eleventh year, the situation remains dire, with hundreds of thousands of people killed, and millions displaced from their homes. International efforts at resolving the conflict have so far been unsuccessful, with the future of the country hanging in the balance. The horrific acts of violence, such as the massacre near Aleppo and the escalating battles between Syrian rebels and government forces, serve as painful reminders of the human cost and devastating consequences of the ongoing conflict. The international community must urgently address the humanitarian crisis that persists in Syria, as well as work towards finding a lasting, peaceful solution to the continuing civil war. This includes providing crucial support for those affected by the violence and facilitating conditions for dialogue and negotiations between the opposing factions. In summary, the recent reports of a new massacre near Aleppo further highlight the brutality and complexity of the Syrian civil war, while the battles between the government forces and rebel groups, including those affiliated with al-Qaeda, continue to plague the war-torn nation. The international community must persist in its efforts to aid the Syrian people and bring about an end to the violent conflict that has wrought so much pain and suffering on the population."},{"prompt":"You are given a statement written in Hindi.

Write some highlights for the following article: Furious activists fighting against anti-Semitism have demanded that a French hamlet changes its name from 'Death to Jews'. Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs - which has a population of less than 20 and is around 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, an. internationally renowned Jewish pressure group, has now sent a letter to. France's Interior Minister to complain about the hamlet's name, and. express shock that nothing has previously been done to address its. controversial moniker. Controversial: Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs (pictured) - which has a population of less than 20 and is 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. Shimon. Samuels, director of the SWC, said he was 'shocked to discover the. existence of a village in France officially called 'Death to Jews'. Referring. to the Second World War Nazi Occupation and the French collaborator. government, Mr Samuels added: 'It is extremely shocking that this name. has slipped under the radar in the 70 years that have passed since. France was liberated from Nazism and the Vichy regime.' Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews murdered. Many more were persecuted in major cities, including Paris, where 'round-ups' were regularly carried out by the Nazis. But the deputy mayor of the village of Courtemaux - population 289 - which has jurisdiction over 'La-Mort-aux-Juifs', said nobody had anything to be ashamed of. 'It's ridiculous. This name has always existed,' said Marie-Elizabeth Secretand, in an interview with France's national news agency, AFP. 'No one has anything against the Jews, of course. It doesn't surprise me that this is coming up again.' History: Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews (pictured) murdered. Changing the name would require a decision by the municipal council, and Ms Secretand said this was unlikely to be successful. 'Why change a name that goes back to the Middle Ages or even further?,' she said. 'We should respect these old names. 'A previous municipal council, at least 20 years ago, already refused to change the name of this hamlet, which consists of a farm and two houses.' The Israeli offensive against Gaza, in which hundreds of civilians including young children have died, has led to claims of increased anti-Semitism in France. Others say that the increasing electoral success of the far-right National Front, whose founder Jean Marie Le Pen is a convicted anti-Semite, is another reason why Jews are feeling unsafe. There are currently around 500,000 Jews in France, but many are expressing a desire to emigrate to places where they will feel more secure. Castrillo Matajudios - which means 'Castrillo Kill Jews' - is a Spanish village which voted to change its name in May. Highlights:","completion":"Activists are asking for a small French hamlet called \\"Death to Jews\\" to change its name because it is not nice to Jewish people. The village is very small and has less than 20 people living there.

A group that helps protect Jewish people sent a letter to someone important in France to ask them to change the name.

Use a parchment paper: Before you start baking, cut a piece of parchment paper that is the same size as the bottom of your pan.

When you finish baking, the parchment paper will help to keep your pan clean because most of the food will stick to the paper instead of the pan. 2. Grease your pan: Before you put your baking mixture into the pan, gently spread butter, oil, or cooking spray evenly onto the bottom and sides of the pan.

Both of these methods can help to make a pan easier to clean, but using parchment paper might be a little bit more helpful because it can prevent more food from sticking to the pan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood... answer the following question: Where did the man who was born in modest circumstances to perform the Proms after the 1941 bombing?

News article: Jimmy Savile abused children across six decades at 14 hospitals including Great Ormond Street and a children's hospice, according to a police report. He also carried out 14 alleged assaults at schools. Commander Peter Spindler of the Metropolitan police said Savile used his fame and celebrity status to \\"hide in plain sight\\", adding that he had \\"groomed the nation\\". The report into his activities reveals his offending spans from 1955-2009. Most of his victims were children – 73% – and he committed most of the offences when he was aged between 40 and 50. Spindler said the report \\"paints a stark picture emphasising the tragic consequences of when vulnerability and power collide. His offending footprint was vast, predatory and opportunistic\\". Some of the hospitals where the TV and radio presenter abused children are: Leeds general infirmary, Great Ormond Street, Exeter hospital, Saxondale mental health hospital in Nottinghamshire, and Wheatfield hospice in Leeds, a Sue Ryder hospice for dying children. According to the report, called Giving Victims a Voice, 450 victims have come forward to allege incidents, and Savile committed 214 criminal offences in 28 areas of England and Wales. Savile offended while working at the BBC between 1965 and 2006, the year he sexually assaulted a teenage girl at the final recording of Top of the Pops. Most of the victims were aged between 13 and 16. Savile raped 34 people, including 28 children. He used every opportunity and every institution to which he had access because of his fame to target young people. Fifty-seven of the allegations took place in 14 hospitals and a hospice in the UK. He assaulted 16 victims at Leeds general infirmary, one at Great Ormond Street hospital and he assaulted someone who was visiting a dying child at the Sue Ryder Wheatfield hospice in Leeds. At Great Ormond Street the child Savile abused died, but someone who witnessed what happened came forward. He also assaulted children and young girls 33 times in TV and radio studios and there were 14 assaults in schools. Savile was invited into the schools – which have not been named – by children who wanted to appear on Jim'll Fix It, police said. The youngest of Savile's victims was an eight-year-old boy who he touched sexually, and his last victim was a 46-year-old woman who was assaulted in 2009. DS David Gray, who led the inquiry, said: \\"He has spent every minute of every working day thinking about this. Whenever an opportunity came along he took it. He picked on vulnerable victims and he was clever enough to choose people who he knew would not speak out.\\" Gray said he expected the number of crimes recorded to rise above 214. The Crown Prosecution Service said in a separate report released on Friday that had police and prosecutors taken a different view to allegations from four women as recently as 2007 Savile may have been brought to justice. The director of public prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement on Savile's offending. He said the report by Alison Levitt QC on the CPS's handling of cases brought before it had concluded the investigations into four complaints from women by Surrey and Sussex police could have been dealt with differently. \\"Whilst most of the complainants continue to speak warmly of the individual officers with whom they had contact, most of those spoken to by Ms Levitt QC have said that, had they been given more information by the police at the time of the investigation, and in particular had each been told that she was not the only woman to have complained, they would probably have been prepared to give evidence. \\"Having spoken to the complainants, Ms Levitt QC has concluded that, although there are a number of imponderables, had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach a prosecution might have been possible in relation to three of the four allegations.\\" The CPS review revealed how Savile had batted away the allegations made by four women in 2007-08 of past abuse. He told Surrey police in 2009 that the sexual assault complaints against him were \\"invented\\" and an \\"occupational hazard\\" for a famous entertainer. Savile made the comments when he was interviewed under caution. He told police he had a \\"policy\\" for dealing with sexual assault complaints made against him and that he had sued five newspapers in the past. A police log of the interview records Savile as saying: \\"If this [these allegations] does not disappear then my policy will swing into action.\\" His offending took place predominantly in Leeds and London, his home town and his main work location respectively. Gray said Savile was not part of a paedophile ring but detectives were investigating whether he was part of a loose network of paedophiles who knew each other and took advantage of their position to sexually abuse children. The report said the institutions and agencies that missed past opportunities to stop Savile must do all they can to ensure their procedures for safeguarding children are as robust as possible. \\"Only then can the victims who have come forward be reassured that it is unlikely to happen again.\\" Gray said: \\"The offences started before he was a BBC celebrity but it seems clear that his peak offending coincided with his peak status.\\" He said Savile did not order victims to be silent, he just abused them then discarded them. \\"His force of personality was powerful. He dismissed his victims afterwards; he did what he wanted to do then just discarded them and they were too frightened to speak out.\\" The prime minister's spokesman said: \\"These are further appalling allegations. What is required is that every organisation involved has to investigate what has gone on and get to the bottom of it. \\"There are a series of investigations that were already ongoing into a number of hospitals. The Department of Health had already announced that Kate Lampard QC was overseeing those and she will also report to the secretary of state on what lessons can be learnt for the health system as a whole.\\" ||||| Image caption Sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile emerged after his death Adults and children, including a boy of eight, were abused by Jimmy Savile, a report detailing allegations over 50 years has revealed. Police and the NSPCC outlined offences by the late presenter at venues including 13 hospitals and a hospice. Some 214 crimes were recorded across 28 police force areas, including 34 of rape or penetration, the report said. The CPS apologised for missing the opportunity to prosecute Savile in 2009, while he was still alive. The Metropolitan Police said the victims' accounts painted a \\"compelling picture of widespread sexual abuse by a predatory sex offender\\", and Cdr Peter Spindler, who is leading the investigation, said Savile had \\"groomed the nation\\". The NSPCC said Savile had been one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history. 'Sincere apology' The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary. Revelations that Savile had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and a number of other institutions. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Commander Peter Spindler: \\"We will... make sure victims in the future have a voice\\" NSPCC director of child protection advice and awareness Peter Watt said: \\"The sheer scale of Savile's abuse over six decades simply beggars belief. \\"He is without doubt one of the most prolific sex offenders we have ever come across and every number represents a victim that will never get justice now he is dead.\\" The Giving Victims a Voice report set out the findings of Operation Yewtree, which launched three months ago to investigate the Savile abuse claims. The 30-page document detailed a number of findings, including: Savile offended at 13 hospitals, including Great Ormond Street, with one offence recorded at Wheatfields Hospice in 1977 A total of 14 offences were recorded in relation to schools Savile's youngest victim was an eight-year-old boy, and the oldest was a 47-year-old woman The earliest allegation is from 1955 in Manchester and the last is from 2009 Offences were carried out at the BBC between 1965 and 2006, including at the last Top of the Pops recording Peak offending took place between 1966 and 1976 A total of 450 people have made sexual abuse allegations against Savile since October - of whom 73% were under 18, with most aged 13 to 16 There is \\"no clear evidence\\" he operated in paedophile ring, although \\"whether he was part of an informal network\\" is still being investigated Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt: \\"We want to know that we have the right procedures in place\\" In response to the report, the BBC said it was \\"appalled\\" some of the offences were committed on its premises and restated a \\"sincere apology to the victims of these crimes\\". The report also revealed 16 offences were committed at Leeds General Infirmary between 1965-95 and 22 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital between 1965-88. One offence was committed at each of the following hospitals - Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital, St James Leeds Hospital, High Royds Psychiatric Hospital, Dewsbury Hospital, Wycombe General Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1971, Ashworth Hospital, Exeter Hospital, Royal Portsmouth Hospital, St Catherine's Hospital in Birkenhead, and Saxondale Mental Health.

He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the scale of the challenge for the NHS's investigation into Savile's abuse on its premises was \\"absolutely huge\\" because it would cover a period of about 40 years. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for \\"a proper overarching review led by child protection experts into why everyone failed to stop Savile and what should be done now\\". \\"A myriad of small reviews and inquiries into how it could happen in different hospitals or the BBC are just not enough,\\" she said. The Crown Prosecution Service also published a review of a decision in 2009 not to charge Savile with sexual offences in relation to four complaints made to police in Surrey and Sussex. It said further action might have been possible had \\"police and prosecutors taken a different approach\\", prompting director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer to apologise on behalf of the CPS and say the report represented a \\"watershed moment\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Deborah Cogger describes being abused by Savile at the age of 14 'Extremely distressing' Great Ormond Street Hospital called the report \\"extremely distressing\\", adding the allegation relating to the hospital was \\"not reported at the time and therefore neither the police nor GOSH hold any records relating to the matter\\". Wheatfields Hospice said it was \\"appalled and dismayed\\" to hear the allegation against it and its \\"thoughts are with the individual involved and their family at this difficult time\\". BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas said the main target for victims making compensation claims would be the Savile estate. The BBC could also be targeted, he added. Operation Yewtree has three strands - claims against Savile, claims against Savile and others, and claims against others. The report marks the end of the investigation into claims against Savile. The allegations against Savile prompted a series of investigations, including three at the BBC and another by the Department of Health into his role at Broadmoor. The Dame Janet Smith Review, which is looking into the culture and practices of the BBC while Savile was an employee, said it had now been contacted by more than 350 people. The investigation is ongoing. ||||| FILE - In this Dec. 17, 1986 file photo, disc jockey Jimmy Savile is pictured at Madame Tussauds museum in London, England. British police say the late entertainer Jimmy Savile committed more than 200... (Associated Press) All fell victim to the late British entertainer Jimmy Savile, police said, describing him Friday as a sexual predator who used his fame to find victims and deliberately targeted individuals who would not speak out against him. A three-month police investigation yielded a staggering litany of sexual crimes: 214 offenses, including 34 rapes, over more than half a century, the majority of the victims under 18. Police say they expect the number of offenses to rise as more allegations are investigated. A police report published Friday describes a \\"prolific, predatory sex offender\\" whose celebrity unlocked the doors of institutions across Britain, from hospitals where he served as a charity fundraiser to schools whose pupils eagerly watched his television programs _ and even to the prime minister's country house, where he dined with Margaret Thatcher. \\"It could be said that he groomed a nation,\\" said Cmdr. Peter Spindler, head of the Metropolitan Police specialist crimes unit. \\"He was hiding in plain sight, but none of us were able to do anything about it.\\" The catalog of abuse provides the fullest accounting yet of the allegations against Savile, a cigar-chomping, platinum-haired TV and radio personality who died in October 2011 at age 84. Savile's elaborate funeral reflected his status as a popular entertainer and tireless charity worker, but a documentary broadcast late last year pulled the mask away, claiming that he was a serial sex offender who traded on his celebrity to prey on vulnerable children. The subsequent police investigation more than bore out those allegations. Detectives initially believed there were between 20 and 25 victims. So far, 450 have come forward with claims against Savile _ a scale of abuse police called \\"unprecedented in the U.K.\\" Child welfare experts say Savile's fame helped him achieve that grim distinction. \\"Savile cunningly built his entire life around gaining access to vulnerable children,\\" said Peter Watt of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Savile set himself up as a sinister Pied Piper; children came to him. He hosted the long-running BBC music show \\"Top of the Pops,\\" which saw everyone from the Rolling Stones to the Sex Pistols perform before an audience of excited young people. Police say victims were assaulted in dressing rooms or groped during filming breaks. One victim was a teenager who said she was assaulted at the last-ever recording of the show in 2006, when Savile was nearly 80. Savile also hosted \\"Jim'll Fix It,\\" a BBC TV show on which he granted the wishes of young viewers who wrote in with cherished plans. Police said Savile would sometimes visit the letter-writers' schools, and some of the offenses took place there. \\"He could do anything he wanted,\\" said Detective Supt. David Gray, who led the police investigation. \\"He could turn up at a school and say \`Is anyone interested in meeting me?'\\" He often visited a school for troubled girls, where pupils were allegedly offered cigarettes and trips in Savile's car in return for sex. The flamboyant star often drove a convertible Rolls-Royce. \\"He only picked on the most vulnerable,\\" Gray said. \\"He was clever enough to know the ones less likely to speak out against him.\\" Savile also was a fundraiser for hospitals, including Leeds General Infirmary in his northern England home town and the Stoke Mandeville spinal injuries center in southern England. Police said he committed 50 assaults at 14 medical establishments, including a cancer hospice and several psychiatric hospitals. Among his victims were ill youngsters confined to bed. Savile's charitable work raised his profile and credibility. Recently released records show he lobbied Thatcher for government donations and tax breaks for charities. \\"I find it quite scary that people who had the power to stop him didn't use that power ... and he went on to do the most horrific things to people in the most awful circumstances,\\" said Caroline Moore, who says Savile abused her as she recovered from a spinal operation at Stoke Mandeville in 1971. Some Savile victims did speak out. Several women went to police to report Saville in 2003, 2007 and 2008, and senior prosecutor Alison Levitt said Friday that the entertainer could have been brought to justice while he was alive, if officials had pursued the allegations more vigorously. The BBC _ which has been strongly criticized for dropping an investigation into Savile's crimes shortly after this death _ and several health bodies are holding their own inquiries into how Savile was able to get away with decades of abuse. Peter Saunders of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said authorities must be more prepared to listen to children who say they have been abused. \\"I want us to forget Jimmy Savile. He is not worthy of memory,\\" Saunders said. \\"But I want us to remember his many victims.\\" ___ Jill Lawless can be reached at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The late British entertainer, Jimmy Savile, has been described by Metropolitan Police as one of the most prolific sex offenders in its history.

The plot focuses on their efforts to take down a notorious criminal organization. Step 2: Establish the central conflict The team has been chasing a dangerous criminal mastermind for some time, but all their efforts have been undermined by an unidentified mole within their ranks. The mole consistently leaks vital information and puts all their operations at risk. Step 3: Develop a subplot Costigan has been working on a separate investigation, trying to identify the mole. He starts becoming suspicious of Sullivan due to his odd behavior, frequent late-night phone calls, and mysterious rendezvous with unidentified individuals. Step 4: Plan the climactic rooftop confrontation Costigan follows Sullivan to a remote rooftop one night, where Sullivan meets with the criminal mastermind.

The father of a 6-year-old victim of the Sandy Hook school shooting appeared on Piers Morgan Live today to talk about the looming one-year anniversary of the tragedy – and the pain of celebrating the holidays without his child. Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was shot dead in the December 14, 2012, massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, said that he expected Christmas spent without his boy to be just as difficult this year as the year before. ‘I will probably take the Christmas tree down that I never took down from last year,’ Heslin said. In mourning: Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was shot dead in the December 14, 2012, massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, spoke about his life since the tragedy. Portrait of grief: Neil Heslin, father of six-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victim Jesse Lewis, holds a picture of him with Jesse as he testifies during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 'The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013' He explained that he and Jesse set up the tree after Thanksgiving and were planning to decorate it on the weekend of the shooting. With Jesse not there to trim it, the bare tree has been standing in the Heslin household ever since the shooting. Mr Heslin also addressed the controversial decision to release today the harrowing audio recordings of 911 calls made during the massacre, saying he wished they remained sealed. ‘It’s just a sad reminder of what happened and clearly the day is etched in my mind, December 14th,’ he said. The grieving man compared the heart-breaking experience of losing a child to an amputation. Mr Heslin, pictured in March during a pro-gun control event in New York, said he could not bring himself to take down last year's tree that he and his son (right) had set up just before the school shooting. Hero: Scarlett Lewis, mother of Sandy Hook victim Jesse Lewis, said that her son yelled for his classmates to run away before Adam Lanza shot him in the head. Controversial move: Mr Heslin criticized the decision to release the audio recordings of 911 calls made during the December 14, 2012, tragedy. ‘I guess the best description I could give is it's like losing a leg and an arm and not being able to support yourself,’ Neil Heslin told the interviewer. On the event of the anniversary, Mr Morgan also spoke to Marsha Lanza, the aunt of the 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, who revealed that the massacre has 'shaken their family to the core.' Different perspective: Adam Lanza's aunt, Marsha Lanza (right) said that the massacre has shaken their family to the core and that she too knows what it means to lose a child. Speaking from her home in Florida, Mrs. Lanza, who is married to the brother of Adam's father, recalled how. she first learned of the tragedy in Newtown. Monster: Adam Lanza, 20, killed his mother and then opened fire inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, killing 26 people, among them 20 children. The woman said that when she saw an early news report about the school shooting on TV, she thought to herself, 'Oh no, not another one,' not knowing at the time the identity of the killer. When she learned that it was her nephew who murdered 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself, Marsha Lanza said she was shocked and immediately called her husband. In the candid conversation about the tragedy, Adam Lanza's aunt said she is no stranger to loss and knows all too well how the victims' families feel. ‘My heart goes out to each and every family that has lost a child,’ she said. ‘Personally, I have lost two sons. I know what you feel, I know what you’ll feel five years from now and 10 years from now.’ She added: 'You can't dwell on the bad times...you will endure.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article is about a man named Neil Heslin, who lost his son, Jesse Lewis, in a very sad event called the Sandy Hook school shooting. The Sandy Hook shooting happened on December 14, 2012, in a place called Newtown, Connecticut. A man named Adam Lanza hurt a lot of people and many children lost their lives that day. Neil Heslin talked about how much he misses his son, especially during special times like Christmas. He and Jesse had set up a Christmas tree before the shooting, but after Jesse was gone, Neil couldn't bring himself to take the tree down. In the article, Neil also talks about how sad it was to hear the record of phone calls made during the Sandy Hook shooting, as it brought back very sad memories. The article also mentions Adam Lanza's aunt, Marsha Lanza, who is also saddened by the shooting and has experienced the loss of her own children. She understands the pain of the families who lost their loved ones during the Sandy Hook tragedy.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then. About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York (in Tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night. What's not to like about this film? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang \\"If we were in love\\" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous. Get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today!","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down into segments and look for positive, negative, and neutral expressions. 1. \\"I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then.\\" - Positive sentiment (shows appreciation) 2. \\"About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York (in Tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night.\\" - Positive sentiment (shows admiration and a positive memory) 3. \\"What's not to like about this film?\\" - Rhetorical question, implying positive sentiment 4. \\"The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great.\\" - Positive sentiment (praising music and Pavarotti's performance) 5. \\"The story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen.\\" - Positive sentiment (enjoyment of the story and humor) 6. \\"The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang 'If we were in love' (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English).\\" - Positive sentiment (appreciation of the visuals and the song) 7. \\"And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous.\\" - Positive sentiment (appreciation of the music) 8. \\"Get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti.\\" - Neutral sentiment (clarifying the premise of the film) 9. \\"Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles.\\" - Positive sentiment (praising the other actors) 10. \\"I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today!\\" - Positive sentiment (appreciation and desire for the film to be released on DVD, praises Pavarotti's performance) In summary, this review expresses an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, with the reviewer praising multiple aspects of the film including the music, story, humor, visuals, and performances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In recent years there was a high demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance but according to the CAP theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What explains the difficulty in a system containing availability, consistency, and partition tolerance guarantees?","completion":"The difficulty in achieving a system that provides availability, consistency, and partition tolerance simultaneously lies in the inherent trade-offs between these properties, as stated by the CAP theorem. The CAP theorem was proposed by Eric Brewer in 2000 and later proven by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch from MIT in 2002. To better understand this difficulty, let's define each of the CAP properties: 1. Consistency: Every node in a distributed system sees the same data at the same time. This means that after a write operation, all subsequent read operations should return the updated value, ensuring that all operations follow a linear order. 2. Availability: Every request to the system receives a response, indicating either success or failure. In simpler words, the system should always be operational and responsive to requests regardless of any failures encountered. 3. Partition tolerance: The system continues to function even if the network is divided into two or more isolated partitions due to communication failures or network issues. The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can meet at most two of these three requirements simultaneously. The reason for this difficulty is the underlying trade-offs necessary to ensure each property which often conflict with one another. Let's analyze these trade-offs: 1. Consistency vs Availability: In a distributed system, when a client writes a piece of data, this data must be propagated across all nodes in the system to guarantee consistency. However, this propagation takes time and will often require acknowledgment from each node to ensure data stability. During this time, if any part of the system becomes unavailable due to a network failure or node crash, the system can't guarantee complete and up-to-date data to all clients, leading to inconsistency. 2. Consistency vs Partition tolerance: To maintain consistency across all nodes, the system must enforce strict control over data flow and updates. However, in the presence of network partitions, ensuring that all nodes have the same data can be challenging. If the system prioritizes consistency, it might have to sacrifice availability by blocking some operations or allowing only partial functionality, which can be detrimental during a partition. 3. Availability vs Partition tolerance: If a system aims for high availability, it must continue to operate under network partition conditions. If a partition occurs, the system has two options: either block operations until the partition is resolved (harming availability) or continue to operate independently in both partitions, which may result in inconsistent data once the partition is resolved. Due to these trade-offs, it is difficult to create a system that guarantees availability, consistency, and partition tolerance simultaneously. As a result, modern distributed systems and databases often choose to adopt an \\"eventual consistency\\" model, which prioritizes availability and partition tolerance and works to provide a flexible degree of data consistency. This approach enables systems to be more resilient in the face of network failures and scale effectively across a large number of nodes. However, it comes at the cost of relinquishing the guarantee of immediate consistency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The film version of the speech is heavily condensed, with much of the original vulgarity removed. Following the humiliating American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in 1943, Patton is placed in charge of the American II Corps in North Africa. Upon his arrival, he enforces discipline amongst his troops, e.g. fining a cook 20 for not wearing his army issue leggings. Patton is then summoned to a meeting with Air Marshal Coningham of the Royal Air Force, where he claims that the American defeat was caused by lack of air cover. Coningham promises Patton that he will see no more German aircraft - but seconds later the compound is strafed by Luftwaffe planes. Patton then defeats a German attack at the Battle of El Guettar; his aide Captain Jenson is killed in the battle, and is replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German-Italian Panzer Army, was on medical leave due to having diphtheria, but Codman reassures him that: \\"If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel\\". After success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and Bernard Law Montgomery plan the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the South-East (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement), initially impresses their superior General Alexander, however Eisenhower rejects it in favour Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the South-East, covering Montgomery's left flank. Whilst the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and push his army northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island.

News article: Please enable Javascript to watch this video One Whittier police officer has died and another officer was wounded following a Monday morning shootout with a recently paroled \\"known gang member\\" who is suspected of the fatal shooting of another man hours earlier, authorities said. The police shooting, which also left the suspect injured, occurred around 8:30 a.m. in the area of Colima Road and Mar Vista Street in Whittier, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. The officer killed was identified Monday afternoon as Keith Boyer, a veteran of the Whittier Police Department. “He was the best of the best,” Whittier police Chief Jeff A. Piper said. Piper teared up as he described Boyer, saying the two had played music together and had been friends for a quarter-century. The other officer, who is expected to survive, is Officer Patrick Hazell, Piper said. Boyer was killed when he and Hazell were responding to a traffic collision, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said. The gunman had rear-ended a car and then got out of his vehicle and asked the occupants of a car he hit to help him push his vehicle out of the road and around the corner onto Mar Vista Street, a sheriff's news release stated. When the officers got there, they first went to talk to the occupants of the vehicle that was rear-ended, who in turn pointed them to the suspect's vehicle. The officers then went around the corner to that car and made contact with the driver, asking him to get out of the car. They were going to pat him down to check for weapons when the gunfire began, Corina said. \\"When they're doing that, that's when he pulls out a gun and he engages them in a gunfight. And that’s when both officers get shot, and the suspect gets shot,\\" Corina said. It was not known how many shots were fired during the close-range gun battle, which took place in what Corina described as a \\"nicer area\\" of Whittier. Once other officers arrived on scene, the shooter was taken into custody. He was driving a stolen car and was a known gang member from Los Angeles with an extensive rap sheet, Corina said. Authorities have identified the 26-year-old Hispanic suspect, but have not named him yet. He was released from custody about a week before Monday's shooting and was on parole, Corina said, calling it an \\"early release.\\" It's not yet known why he was released or what charge he had been serving time for. The car had been stolen out of East Los Angeles, where the suspect may have been involved in another killing earlier Monday morning, Corina said. \\"Unbeknownst to the Whittier police officers, when they went to pull the car over, they had a murder suspect ... in a stolen car,\\" Corina said. Witnesses have identified the suspect as being responsible for that other killing, which was also a shooting, Corina said. The lieutenant did not provide many details about the earlier killing, but said investigators had been told the victim was a male relative of the suspect. The family of the victim said the suspect was the man's cousin. The man's killing occurred about 5:30 a.m. in the 1400 block of Volney Drive, the Sheriff's Department said later Monday in a brief news release. Shortly after the police shooting, aerial video from Sky5 showed a Whittier police SUV with shattered rear and passenger windows. A sedan directly in front of the SUV had front-end damage, and a firearm was visible on top of its trunk. Corina said it appeared the suspect had been armed with a semi-automatic handgun. “It’s extremely tragic,\\" Corina said. \\"You’ve got a couple officers who just responded to a traffic accident, and they think they’re there to help out people involved in a traffic accident. Next thing they know, they got this guy shooting at them. He shoots both of them and kills one of them.” After identifying Boyer as the victim, Piper said he'd seen an increase in violence against officers during arrests. He referred to ballot-box propositions that he said were increasing crime. \\"Everybody needs to know what these officers are dealing with on a daily basis,\\" Piper said. \\"You have no idea how it's changed in that last four years. ... People don't want to follow rules. People don't care about other people. ... This is a senseless, senseless tragedy that did not need to be.\\" Sheriff Jim McDonnell spoke alongside Piper, also remarking on early release and rehabilitation programs. \\"We're putting people back on the street that aren't ready to be back on the street,\\" McDonnell said. Speaking at a news conference shortly before 2 p.m., Corina told reporters the injured officer was in stable condition. The suspect, he added, was in the intensive care unit; video from the scene showed him conscious and handcuffed. while being placed into an ambulance. In the afternoon, hundreds of law enforcement officers accompanied the Boyer's body in a procession from UC Irvine Medical Center to the Orange County coroner’s office. After a van holding the officer’s remains arrived at its destination, fellow officers lined up and saluted the flag-draped casket as it was wheeled inside.

Corina said the two Whittier officers responded to the scene. They ordered the suspect out of the car. Corina said officers went to check the suspect for a weapon because they could see he had tattoos over his face and neck and had \\"gang attire.\\" \\"As they went to pat him down for any weapons, that's when he pulled out his gun and that's when he started shooting,\\" Corina said. The suspect was driving a stolen car from East Los Angeles, Corina said. The suspect was identified as being involved in an earlier fatal shooting there, the lieutenant said. Corina said the officers, who were wearing protective vests, didn't know the car was stolen or that the driver may have been involved in criminal activity. Authorities said the suspect was released on parole about a week ago. Officials did not reveal details on his conviction or his parole. \\"I won't speak about the suspect, because frankly I don't think he's worth speaking about,\\" Whittier police Chief Jeff Piper said. Officer was 'best of the best' \\"I can honestly say on behalf of all the officers, he was the best of the best,\\" Piper said of Boyer. \\"Our community knows him, and they would say the same thing.\\" Boyer, who died at a hospital, was a \\"a fantastic officer\\" who climbed the ranks from a job as a dispatcher. \\"Keith was very humble,\\" Piper said. A divorced father of grown children, Boyer had recently talked about retirement, Piper said. The chief said he had played in a band with Boyer, who was a drummer. At one point, Piper broke down. \\"It's really hard for me to hold back my tears because all of us have been grieving since 10 this morning, and I didn't think I had any tears left,\\" he said.

Aristotle (; , , \\"Aristotélēs\\"; 384–322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism. He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works. 1.

Often, the first single of an album is one that the artist, producer, or recording company believes has the potential to gain significant attention or success. These songs are usually part of the album from which they were released. Therefore, it is not only typical but also logical for \\"Goodbye on a Bad Day\\" to be included in the \\"Chase the Sun\\" album. Furthermore, it is common in the music industry for an album to comprise the singles that have been released out of it. It's part of the allure of an album - a compilation of an artist's latest works including the singles that might have already been popular on music charts. Moreover, these singles often serve as promotional factor for the album, increasing its commercial appeal and marketability. In this case, it seems that \\"Goodbye on a Bad Day\\" did create an impact given the fact that it reached #28 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.

The music was composed by KJ Joy and lyrics was written by Sathyan Anthikkad. In this sentence, it is clear that KJ Joy is responsible for composing the music, while Sathyan Anthikkad is responsible for writing the lyrics. The roles of the two individuals are articulated without any confusion. However, it should be noted that there is a minor grammatical error in this sentence to make it more accurate, it should say \\"...and lyrics *were* written by Sathyan Anthikkad.\\" 2. The music was written by KJ Joy and the lyrics by Sathyan Anthikkad composed. In this sentence, it appears that KJ Joy is given credit for writing the music, which could potentially imply that they are responsible for both the composition and the lyrics because \\"writing\\" is often associated with lyrics in popular music. Moreover, the latter part of the sentence \\"... the lyrics by Sathyan Anthikkad composed\\" is not only grammatically incorrect but it also creates confusion as to who performed which role. To accurately convey the same meaning as in the first sentence, it should be restructured as follows: \\"The music was composed by KJ Joy, and the lyrics were written by Sathyan Anthikkad.\\" This corrected sentence provides a clear understanding that KJ Joy is the composer, while Sathyan Anthikkad is the lyricist.

Article: Protect both your hardware and yourself by taking care of any electrical components. Shut off your computer first, then unplug the keyboard from it. If you're using a wireless keyboard, remove the batteries. Unplug the power cord if you're working on a laptop. Touch a key to make sure the computer is completely off. If you have a non-USB keyboard, always turn off the computer before unplugging the keyboard. The keys on most modern keyboards fit over small clips and are easy to remove. Wedge a flathead screwdriver or butter knife underneath the corner of a key and lightly pry it up. Then, try to pull the key straight up with your fingers. You may need to wiggle it or pry up the opposite side to slide it off its clip. Take a quick picture of the keyboard with your phone before pulling off the keys. It will help you put the keys back in the correct order later. For an easy way to remove keys, get a wire keycap puller. Find one online or at an electronics store. If you're unsure about removing keys, consult your owner's manual or call the manufacturer. Find out their recommendations for key removal and cleaning. Flip the keyboard over and look for screws. Some keyboards consist of faceplates bound together. If the keyboard has screws, remove the bottom faceplate to wash it separately. Check for hidden screws underneath the keyboard's labels. If you can't remove the keys, you usually can remove the faceplate. Take the keys off afterward, if possible, to give the faceplate a more thorough cleaning. Set out a towel next to the sink. Run warm water from the faucet as you gather the keys into a colander. Then, hold the colander underneath running water, swirling the keys around by hand to rinse them. With a colander, most water and debris rinses off right away. When you're done, set the keys on a towel to finish drying. If rinsing isn't enough to clean the keys, try using a liquid dish soap. Fill a bowl with warm water, then mix in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of dish soap to create soapy water. Denture tablets are also very effective and can be used in place of soap. Move the faceplate into a colander or bowl. Try rinsing it out with warm water. Clear out stubborn debris with soapy water and a microfiber cloth. When you're done, set the faceplate aside to dry. If your keyboard is very grimy, soak the faceplate and keys in soapy water for up to 6 hours. Scrub and rinse off everything when you're done. Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth with isopropyl alcohol. Scrub the remaining faceplate to clear out as much debris as possible. Go around the stems that normally hold the keys in place. Make sure the cloth isn't dripping or else some of the moisture may reach the electronic components. Use an electronics cleaning brush from a general store to help remove tough debris. Finish cleaning out the keyboard by wiping away the remaining debris. The key stems are the little towers or clips perched on top of the keyboard. Wipe around the stems to remove debris on the faceplate. Then, dampen a cotton swab with a drop of cleaning solution to wipe off the top of each stem. Change out the cotton swabs as they get dirty to avoid leaving any debris behind. Isopropyl alcohol dries quickly, so it's safer to use than water. Avoid using a lot of it. Dampen each swab lightly. Find a place on your countertop to put the computer parts. Lay out some towels, then arrange the components over them. Keep the parts exposed to fresh air to dry them out. Make sure the computer parts are in a secure spot so they don't fall on the floor or get lost. Keep them inaccessible to children or pets so they dry out fully. Reassemble the keyboard by reversing the steps you took when taking it apart. For most keyboards, you will need to connect the faceplates first. Screw them back together, then set the keys on top of the clips or stems. Usually, all you have to do is slide the keys onto the clips to snap them in place. If your keyboard doesn't work, take it apart again. Make sure you assembled it properly and plugged in all of the cables. Consider calling a professional to give laptops a cleaning. A professional technician can take apart your laptop, find damaged parts, and clean electronic components safely. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: To clean a keyboard, turn off and disconnect your computer and remove the keyboard batteries if necessary. Remove the keys carefully using a screwdriver or keycap puller, and take a photo to help reassemble the keyboard later. If possible, remove the faceplate by unscrewing it. Clean the keys and faceplate using warm, soapy water or denture tablets, rinsing them thoroughly. Use isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth to clean remaining debris from the keyboard's stems and faceplate. Allow all parts to dry completely in a safe area before reassembling the keyboard.

The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization.

Update: You just recently broke up. A:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the hypothesis sentence Usage: The hypothesis sentence is \\"It's rude to date your ex's best friend.\\" This generalizes that in society, it is unacceptable or inappropriate to date the best friend of your former romantic partner. In this example, it sets the standard that, in most cases, dating your ex's best friend is seen as rude behavior. Part #2: Analyze the update Usage: The update is \\"You just recently broke up.\\" This information is a specific circumstance to consider when evaluating the hypothesis. In this case, the fact that the breakup was recent suggests that it would be highly inappropriate to date the ex's best friend, as feelings might still be fresh and it could cause emotional distress to the parties involved. Part #3: Determine if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis Usage: The update acts as a 'weakener' or 'strengthener.' In this example, because the recent breakup makes dating the ex's best friend even more inappropriate, the update functions as a 'strengthener' for the hypothesis. This is because it provides a situation where dating the best friend right after a breakup supports the generalization that it's rude to date your ex's best friend."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Will you watch the football live, and DVR the debate? Or, will you watch the debate live—and DVR the football? I’m just kidding: only lunatics and serial killers DVR football. But if you DVR the debate, do you watch it right after the football, or do you save it for later? Do you let your no-good football pals stay at the house to watch both? Another important question: can you eat wings during a debate? A more important question: does that mean you’re eating wings twice that night? This was inevitable, wasn’t it? In this historically madcap election season, it is only fitting that the presidential race would collide with America’s other overbaked news-hogging national spectacle: football. Two of the three scheduled debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will clash in prime time against the NFL—one debate versus an Atlanta vs. New Orleans Monday Night Football game, and another faces off with a Sunday evening Green Bay vs. New York Football Giants contest. Trump, in particular, is crabby about the conflict, saying he got a letter from the NFL calling the conflict “ridiculous.” (The NFL says it never sent Trump a letter on the matter.) If you’re a space alien watching this American election season from a faraway planet, you’re probably a little confused. How is this even a controversy? How could anyone possibly prioritize football over a presidential debate? To which I say: Allow me to introduce you to America. People in this country reschedule their own weddings in response to the NFL schedule. They induce labor to avoid a showdown with the Super Bowl. On Thanksgiving they actually sit down with people they love and try to watch the Detroit Lions. Football is our true national mania, our only shared religion, other than being rotten to each other on Twitter. TWTR 7.25 % I’m not going to tell you how to decide here. You know what’s more important to your life: Who is going to lead the free world for the next four years, or the Falcons in Week Three. But amid the clamor, I think we’re all missing a brilliant compromise: Hold the presidential debates during the games. Combine football—and politics —into the must-see television event of our lifetimes. Here’s how it can be done: 1. When they’re not playing football, go to Donald and Hillary. Everybody knows there’s a lot of down time in professional football games. A looottt of down time. Fun fact about football: It’s mostly people standing around. Perhaps the best-known story ever produced by the Journal’s sports department calculated that, on average, there is just 11 minutes of action in your standard three-hour NFL game. Eleven minutes! In terms of pace, an NFL game makes curling look hectic. All that downtime is a golden opportunity for the people at the RNC and DNC. Put Trump and Clinton on personalized football carts in opposite end zones, and every time there’s a break in the action, drive the candidates to midfield and go right into the debate. Two minutes of domestic or foreign policy: Go! As soon as the football is ready to return, and the whistle blows, motor Trump and Clinton right off the field. Or, if you want to make it really exciting, leave them both on the field. 2. Take advantage of awful instant replay delays. There’s no more agonizing moment in a football telecast than when the action stops and the officials order coffee and finger sandwiches and spend 18 minutes trying to sort out a mundane out-of-bounds play. This is another huge chance to bring out Trump and Clinton, and get their positions on the Supreme Court, health care, and military action abroad. If the moderator runs out of topics, simply go to Trump’s and Clinton’s thoughts on the ruling on the field, and whether it should or shouldn’t stand. You may think it’s ridiculous that an election could be decided on determining whether the Packers completed a pass, but elections have been decided over more trivial matters. 3. Bag the halftime show. Everybody knows that unless they employ Charles Barkley, halftime shows are completely the pits, so surrendering those 10 or so minutes to the debate would not be a great loss. Bring on Clinton and Trump to talk about the issues. Give them bonus points if they can deliver useless NFL gossip. Imagine a candidate carrying Ohio because they broke a Bengals quarterback change! You might think this is an obnoxious proposal, one that doesn’t confer enough respect on the seriousness of a presidential race. To which I say: I think this proposal confers exactly the right amount of respect upon this presidential race. Besides, the ratings would be huge. Huge! Don’t act above it all. Don’t act like you wouldn’t watch. Politicians come and go, but football is football.

Luckily, it was smooth sailing after that and I was extremely surprised with Biscuits Cafu00e9. The restaurant itself is located on the SE corner of Sahara & Durango. Inside, they've got a really big, spacious dining room and they seem to be doing a great job of keeping it clean and organized.

All the other ingredients were fresh and aside from tasting great, the portions are huge. They literally put what looked to be an entire avocado inside the omelette and it's served with a side of your choice, and biscuits. The salsa appeared to be fresh made and was easily one of the best I've had in a breakfast joint. My only complaint on my plate would be the potatoes. They were cooked well and also served as a huge portion, but they were lacking in salt. If I were to order this omelette again though, I'd ask for extra cheese. Now, with a name like Biscuits Cafu00e9...they better have some good biscuits! Were they the best I've ever had? Probably not. But they are solid and in my opinion, far superior to what you'll find in most other restaurants in town. Buttery, flaky and served with both fresh butter and jam. You can tell they are fresh made every day and even though I'm not usually one to get biscuits for breakfast, I'd make sure to get one every time I'm here. Biscuits and gravy fans will love the version here. Aside from the weird start, the customer service is great too. I could be wrong, but it looks like a family run joint and even if they aren't, you can tell they put a lot of love into their food. As others have mentioned, it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting busy and you're waiting for a table. It may have started off bad and a dead restaurant at peak times, is almost always a red flag...but Biscuits Cafu00e9 is serving up huge portions of killer food at great prices, and I'll happily be a repeat customer!

Although the reviewer experienced a few initial issues, such as a lack of customers and a confusing start with multiple wait staff, they were ultimately impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the restaurant.

Background: A disc jockey, often abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays existing recorded music for a live audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJ, club DJ who performs at a nightclub or music festival, and turntablist who uses record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. The title \\"DJ\\" is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names. Context: Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques. Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys. Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources. In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques. Question: What are the DJ Techniques talked about in the article?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The DJ techniques mentioned in the article are: 1. Cueing: This is when DJs listen to the next song they want to play in their headphones before mixing it into the current playing music. This helps them to know when to start the next song for a smooth transition. 2. Equalization: DJs adjust the levels of different frequencies (like bass, mid, or treble) in the music to make it sound better or to blend it smoothly with another track. 3. Audio Mixing: This is when DJs blend two or more sound sources (songs) together to create a seamless flow of music. 4. Beatmatching: DJs match the beats or tempo of two songs to create a smooth transition between them. This keeps the music flowing and dancers dancing. 5. Phrasing: DJs make sure that two songs are not just matched in beats but also in their structure or phrases, so that the mix sounds good and seamless. 6. Slip-cueing: This technique helps DJs to start a song at the right moment, so it sounds in sync with the current playing song. 7. Turntablism: Some DJs use techniques like cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, and back spinning to create unique sounds and transitions between songs. This is more like using the turntables as a musical instrument. 8. Harmonic Mixing: DJs choose songs that are in compatible musical keys, so they sound good together when mixed. With the help of new technology, some of these techniques can be automated, like beatmatching and phrasing, making it easier for DJs to mix music smoothly."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

OPT: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no","completion":"The premise \\"and no slogan\\" refers to a scenario in which there is no slogan present. However, this premise does not provide information on why there is no slogan. Therefore, it does not directly or necessarily entail the given hypothesis, \\"Their slogan, \\"why not now?\\" Was deemed to be inflammatory and dropped from the ads.\\" The absence of a slogan could be due to various reasons, not just because it was inflammatory. The slogan could have been removed because it was not effective, because the company wants to update its image, there could have been copyright issues with this specific slogan, or it might be part of a new brand strategy to not use slogans, among many other possible reasons. Therefore, it is not direct or inherent from the premise that the absence of the slogan is specific to it being deemed inflammatory and being dropped from the ads. Further, we would need more information to say with certainty that the premise supports this specific hypothesis. Maybe there is additional context or further details that have not been specified in the premise and/or the hypothesis.

Tweet: What is it about mall shopping that makes my feet kill? Choose your answer from: (a). negative. (b). positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet: \\"What is it about mall shopping that makes my feet kill?\\" can be classified as negative. For a comprehensive understanding, each part of the tweet needs to be analysed. The tweet is about a shopping experience at the mall. Typically, shopping might be seen as a positive activity, as it usually involves buying things that one needs or wants, and spending time in a mall can be a form of leisure activity or entertainment. But in this case, the user talks about his/her feet hurting - \\"makes my feet kill\\", which clearly implies discomfort or pain. Use of the word \\"kill\\" in the context of pain or discomfort is exaggerated language, typically used to express strong negative feelings. Therefore, when analysing sentiment, we need to focus on the overall emotional tone behind the words. The phrase \\"makes my feet kill\\" expresses discomfort and dissatisfaction with the experience of mall shopping. Even though mall shopping might be a positive activity in some contexts, it isn't in this specific tweet due to the pain it seems to cause the person, which overshadows the potential benefits or enjoyment of the shopping experience. Hence, based on the analysis of the tone, context and language used in this statement, the sentiment of the tweet is negative. So, option (a). negative, is the correct choice. It's important to remember that sentiment analysis, especially in the context of social media, involves some level of interpretation: sometimes people might be sarcastic or ironic, which can make it more challenging to correctly identify the sentiment. However, in the case of this tweet, there’s no discernable irony or sarcasm, just an expression of genuine discomfort, which means we can reasonably define this as a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Rubio, Amid Planning, Is Yet to Commit on Immigration Bill Drew Angerer for The New York Times There are questions about whether Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, will ultimately sign onto the bill for a broad overhaul of immigration laws that he has been helping to draft. WASHINGTON — When Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, last appeared with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss their plans for a broad overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws, he looked optimistic, apple-cheeked — and slightly nervous. Given the disdain some conservatives reserve for Republicans who consort publicly with Democrats, he had reason to be. The next time Mr. Rubio is likely to appear with his colleagues in the eight-person bipartisan group could be an even bigger moment, when its members officially introduce joint immigration legislation this month. The probable tableau seems ready-made for problems in the 2016 Republican presidential primary fight in which many expect Mr. Rubio to partake: images of Mr. Rubio, smiling and celebrating alongside Democratic senators and maverick Republicans as he claims co-authorship of an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws that many Republicans will reject. And so the question percolating on Capitol Hill has become: Will Mr. Rubio, an up-and-coming young conservative elected on a 2010 Tea Party wave, ultimately sign onto the immigration bill that he has been helping to draft ever since the November election? “We have to see if the Boy Wonder plays ball or not,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group. For now, the answer — among members of the bipartisan group, immigration watchers and even Mr. Rubio’s own staff — is a tentative yes, even with Mr. Rubio increasingly urging caution about racing ahead with any immigration measure as the unveiling draws nigh. “We understand Marco is not going to be rushed into anything,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the group. “But we don’t doubt his commitment to seeing this through at all.” In recent days, Mr. Rubio has begun to sound nervous again when it comes to the immigration legislation. He sent a letter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, counseling against “excessive haste” in changing immigration law. On Sunday, just moments before two of his fellow bipartisan group members were set to appear on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he released a statement that warned, “No final agreement on immigration legislation yet.” Mr. Rubio finds himself in an extremely delicate position as a rising conservative hero and a proponent of immigration law changes. As much as the fate of the bipartisan group’s legislation hangs on Mr. Rubio, who is perhaps the only member of the group with the conservative credentials to sell the plan to skeptical voters, the fate of Mr. Rubio’s ambitions for higher office are also inextricably bound up with the immigration legislation and his base’s reaction to it. So far, Mr. Rubio has seen early success wooing grass-roots Republican voters. When he joined the bipartisan group late last year, after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election in part because he was overwhelmingly rejected by Hispanic voters, Mr. Rubio quickly went on a one-man blitz of conservative news media outlets, explaining his guiding immigration principles and winning plaudits from the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. “The argument is that it’s not conservative policy to have 11 million illegal immigrants in this country,” said Phil Musser, a Republican consultant and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association. “By showing up and by boldly deciding to engage people who have had their fingers in their ears on this issue, he’s been able to decalcify a process that’s been stuck for a long time.” He and his staff have studied the mistakes of the last attempt at immigration overhaul, in 2007, and have tailored their pitch to address conservative concerns. Mr. Rubio stresses that strict goals for border security must be met before any illegal immigrants can be put on a path to citizenship. And he talks of refining the current system — from increased enforcement to a workable plan for future legal immigrants — saying he wants to ensure the country does not face another wave of illegal immigrants down the road. “His emphasis on strong border security and enforcement is a big deal, and I think the Democrats are finally beginning to get that, and I think that is because of his strong leadership and communication skills,” said Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida who was part of the failed 2007 attempt at an immigration overhaul. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article highlights the uncertainty surrounding Senator Marco Rubio's commitment to a bipartisan bill for a broad overhaul of the U.S. immigration laws. Rubio, a Republican of Florida, has been helping draft the legislation since the November election. However, his decision to sign onto the bill may affect his conservative base and future political ambitions. As a rising conservative hero, Rubio is in a delicate position as both a proponent of immigration law changes and someone with higher political aspirations. His support for the immigration bill is crucial for its success, as he is capable of selling the plan to skeptical conservative voters. However, the fate of his ambitions for higher office is also intertwined with the bill and the base's reaction to it. Rubio has been advocating caution in the approach to the immigration measure, seeking strict goals for border security before allowing illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship. He has also focused on refining the existing system to prevent future waves of illegal immigrants. The news article raises questions about whether Rubio will ultimately sign onto the immigration bill he has been helping to draft, with key stakeholders and his staff believing he will, albeit tentatively."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how deep can be drill for deep underwater Suggested answer: The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig.

There are a few basic options when it comes to buying potatoes: baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. All have different qualities when it comes to flavor and texture. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Potatoes cannot be boiled.","completion":"No, the given sentence \\"Potatoes cannot be boiled\\" does not follow, given the preceding text. Instead, you should continue with steps on making simple mashed potatoes. Here's a detailed guide: 1. Choose your potatoes: As mentioned earlier, there are different types of potatoes, such as baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. For making mashed potatoes, Yukon Gold, Russet, and all-purpose potatoes are ideal due to their high starch content and the ability to hold their consistency when mashed. 2. Wash and peel the potatoes: First, rinse the potatoes under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris. Then, using a vegetable peeler or a small paring knife, remove the skin from the potatoes. Rinse them again to remove any residual dirt. 3. Cut the potatoes: Cut the peeled potatoes into uniform, 1-inch cubes or chunks. This helps ensure that they cook evenly and at the same time. 4. Boil the potatoes: Fill a large pot with cold water approximately 2 inches above the potatoes. Adding a pinch of salt to the water is optional. Place the pot on high heat and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low or low, maintaining a gentle simmer. Cook the potatoes for roughly 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender enough to be pierced easily with a fork. 5. Drain the potatoes: Using a colander, drain the potatoes and let them sit for a minute or two, allowing any excess water to evaporate. 6. Heat the butter and milk/cream: While the potatoes are boiling, heat about 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of milk or cream in a small saucepan over low heat. Once the butter has melted and the mixture is warm, set it aside. 7. Mash the potatoes: Use a potato masher, potato ricer, or a fork to mash the potatoes in a large mixing bowl until they reach the desired consistency. Avoid using a food processor, blender, or electric mixer, as they can cause the potatoes to become gummy or soupy. 8. Mix in the butter and milk/cream: While mashing the potatoes, slowly add in the warm butter and milk/cream mixture. Keep mashing until the potatoes are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. 9. Serve and enjoy: Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and serve immediately. You can also add additional toppings such as chopped chives, grated cheese, or cooked bacon bits for extra flavor. Following these steps will result in a delicious, simple, and straightforward mashed potato dish, while also correcting the erroneous statement about boiling potatoes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: That's kind of what Mencap gave disabled voters, their families and carers the chance to do in a hustings with a difference in County Tyrone on Thursday. Rather than pitching questions to a panel of prospective politicians, the disability support charity called on constituents to chat to candidates over a cup of coffee. Seven election hopefuls put their points forward, with a bell ringing after 10 minutes to signal that it was time to switch to the next table for another conversation in a speed-date-style. Mencap's Barry McMenamin said the cafe-style chats gave people the chance to raise their issues directly with those hoping to win their vote. \\"Candidates go around the tables - the people with learning disabilities and their families are sitting at the tables,\\" he explained. \\"They are looking the candidates in the whites of their eyes and asking them: 'When you get to Stormont, what are you going to do for us?'\\" Health issues were high on the agenda, along with knocking down barriers to employment, and enabling easier transport to appointments and to work. Most families pointed out that the Western Health and Social Care Trust was \\"at the bottom of the barrel\\" when it came to disability funding, with the uncovering of a multi-million black hole in cash for support services. Bob Henry, who has two adult sons with disabilities, said they had \\"nobody to lobby for them\\". \\"What I see here in this area, people with a mental or learning disabilities are on the bottom rung of the ladder,\\" he added. \\"They don't get away from the bottom rung, because they're an easy target because they have no comeback, nobody to speak for them, nobody to lobby for them.\\" Joanne McDonald, who has a learning disability and works as an equality officer for Mencap in Omagh, said disabled people \\"need our voices heard\\". \\"Bear in mind that people with a learning disability do need access to the same services as everybody else,\\" she said. \\"But maybe we might need the right services in place that meet the needs of people with a learning disability, and don't forget about us.\\" \\"Listen to young people, because they are the future.\\" That was the message directed at politicians at the Upper Springfield mock assembly poll in west Belfast on Thursday night. About 60 children and teenagers from youth clubs in the area gathered at Whiterock Leisure Centre to speak to election candidates, before casting their votes for their favourites. Michael McAllister, a youth worker at the Upper Springfield Development Trust, said the event was organised because next week's election \\"is going to affect them\\", even though most won't be able to take part in it. \\"It's about politicians coming down to young people's level, and young people having their say,\\" he added. First up, the candidates made their opening pitches with their parties' priorities, but those lacked entertainment value for much of the audience, with some \\"near falling asleep in their seats\\", as Michael explained. But that soon changed, when the election hopefuls spoke to the young people in small groups to take questions on the issues important to them. And no topic was off limits, with children as young as 10 asking about Brexit and the Irish language, while others pushed for answers on LGBT rights and abortion reform. Seventeen-year-old Leah won't get to mark a real ballot paper on 2 March, but she said young people \\"need to get involved more\\" in politics. \\"In the future, they're going to be the people to make the world go around, so why not have their opinion when their young?\\" she asked. And her friend Chloe, who'll also miss out on a vote, urged those who don't intend to exercise their democratic right to think again. \\"Have a real good think about who you would love to vote for, and honestly, just go for it, give your point.\\" Watching on was Koulla Yiasouma, the Northern Ireland commissioner for children and young people, who said that just because younger people can't vote \\"doesn't mean they don't have a voice\\". \\"We have nearly 500,000 young people living in Northern Ireland - what happens in Stormont affects them very intimately, so it's absolutely right that they engage with the politicians,\\" she said. \\"These kids will remember what happened today, and when it is their turn to vote they will have built up those skills to take part in the democratic process.\\" And Michael said the candidates should leave the mock election with plenty on their minds. \\"Young people want to develop themselves, develop their area, they want to improve for the better,\\" he said. \\"But are they being left behind? That's the question the politicians need to ask themselves.\\" BBC News NI's Campaign Catch-up will keep you across the Northern Ireland Assembly election trail with a daily dose of the main stories, the minor ones and the lighter moments in the run up to polling day on Thursday 2 March.

Q: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Chinese art market ranked as world's fastest-growing in past 5 years.","completion":"Title: Christie's Becomes First International Fine Art Auction House to Operate in Mainland China Introduction: Christie's, the prestigious London-based fine art auction house, recently made history by becoming the first international establishment of its kind to receive a license to operate independently in mainland China. This represents not only a remarkable opportunity for the company, but also highlights the tremendous growth potential of the Chinese art market. Breaking Barriers: For decades, the Chinese art market has been dominated by domestic auction houses. However, the granting of the license to Christie's signals a significant shift in the landscape, opening doors for international auction houses to tap into this emerging market segment. Christie's, founded in 1766 and known for auctioning some of the most famous and valuable pieces of art, now has a unique position in mainland China, with the opportunity to shape the future of the art market in the region. The Rise of the Chinese Art Market: The Chinese art market has been making considerable strides over the past few years. It is no coincidence that the country is now home to the world's fastest-growing art market, with some of the most affluent Chinese collectors driving up prices and fueling demand for rare and valuable artwork. A key reason behind the rapid growth of the market is the increase in disposable income and a growing middle class in China. As personal wealth has grown, so has the appetite for fine art as a form of investment, status symbol, and cultural preservation. The Chinese art market has expanded beyond traditional artwork to include modern and contemporary pieces by both domestic and international artists, attracting significant interest from wealthy Chinese millennials who are eager to engage with the global art scene. Christie's Expansion into China: With the receipt of this license, Christie's is well-positioned to seize a share of this lucrative market. Operating independently in the Chinese market will enable the auction house to maintain full control over its operations and adapt to the unique demands and preferences of Chinese collectors. The company is expected to expand its range of offerings and implement tailored marketing strategies targeting local art aficionados. This will likely involve focusing on high-quality Chinese art and antiques, contemporary art from China, and introducing works from abroad that cater to the tastes of the highly discerning Chinese collectors. As more international auction houses are also expected to enter the Chinese market in the future, it will be interesting to see how the competition between local and international players unfolds. Moreover, local auction houses will need to step up their game to compete with their international counterparts, which could potentially lead to more exciting developments and advancements in the local art scene. Conclusion: The granting of the license to operate independently in mainland China to Christie's marks a significant milestone in the world of fine art. It is a testament to the growth and importance of the Chinese art market, and the recognition by international players of its unlimited potential. This development will likely have wide-reaching implications for the global art market and further cement China's position as a major player in the international art scene, attracting even more attention from collectors, investors, and aficionados from around the world. As the first international fine art auction house to embark on this exciting journey, Christie's has the responsibility to set the bar high and establish a new benchmark in the Chinese and global art market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts.

If we find a bird nest, we will have a good place of observing and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their baby birds from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, mothers often leave and come back to the nest during the time to look for food. So it is good to observe birds. When we observe birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how to make a bird nest? It's very easy.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Between banks and venture capital, some start-ups look to a pay-as-you-go model “We get five times the orders coming in, and our cash flow is low because we’re coming off our lowest selling point, which is winter,” owner Laura Howard-Gayeton said. “Last year, we realized we really needed a line of credit to draw on.” To fill the need, Laloo’s turned to Lighter Capital, a firm that provides a type of start-up funding known as revenue-based financing. The arrangement falls somewhere between traditional bank loans and venture capital: A firm invests a few hundred-thousand or million dollars into a start-up, and the start-up pays it back from its monthly earnings rather than through an IPO or exit. Howard-Gayeton said that her bank viewed Laloo’s as too much of a risk and that she didn’t have time to wait for a Small Business Administration loan to process. “While it’s not the cheapest money we could ever borrow,” she said, “for us, Lighter Capital was the most nimble, pain-free experience.” Lighter is one of about a hundred groups in the recently formed Revenue Capital Association. These firms tend to invest in businesses that venture capitalists and angels pass up, and that don’t qualify for — or don’t want — a bank loan. Jeff Schrock, the managing director of Seattle’s Union Bay Capital and a board member of the association, said the difference between his organization and a venture capital firm is, roughly, that the latter invests in a company or team, while a revenue-based firm invests in a product. “If you have a great product that has attractive unit-level economics, it works,” he said. “We are trying to grow businesses that are overlooked by capital markets — the hundreds of other gazelles in the herd that are fantastic businesses. There are a lot more of those than there are Googles and LinkedIns.” Gavino Morin, a founder of Hellfire Games in Austin, got a green light from Sony in 2010 to develop a new game and needed a fast, large influx of cash to hire programmers. He was hesitant to pursue a bank loan with fixed payments, however, because video game revenue can fluctuate. Instead, he went with Next Step Capital Partners, an Austin revenue-based financing firm. Like other entrepreneurs, Morin was attracted to the system because a revenue-based firm wouldn’t ask him to give away shares of his company. “This way, we don’t give up equity in the company,” he said, “and when it’s based on revenue, you build a lot more flexibility into your payment system.” In general, businesses backed by the arrangement pay a pre-determined percentage of their revenue — 3 to 5 percent, for example — to the investor until the entire principal is repaid, plus a return. The returns vary but are almost always higher than those of a typical bank loan: Lighter Capital, which makes investments of 100 to 250,000, said its return is usually 18 to 20 percent, but Schrock said he has seen returns of up to four times the original investment. Summary:","completion":"Start-ups are increasingly turning to revenue-based financing as an alternative to traditional bank loans and venture capital. Firms such as Lighter Capital provide funding to start-ups, which is then repaid from the start-up's monthly earnings rather than through an initial public offering or exit. While returns on these types of arrangements can be higher than those of a typical bank loan, entrepreneurs are attracted to them because they do not involve giving up equity in the business. This model targets businesses that are often overlooked by venture capitalists or do not qualify for a bank loan, and has led to the formation of organizations such as the Revenue Capital Association, comprising around 100 groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is the writer that was healed by a tohunga? , can you please find it? White Lies is a story about the nature of identity: those who deny it and those who strive to protect it. Paraiti is a medicine woman. She is the healer and midwife of her rural, tribal people - she believes in life. But new laws are in force prohibiting unlicensed healers. On a rare trip to the city, she is approached by Maraea, the servant of a wealthy woman, Rebecca, who seeks her knowledge and assistance in order to hide a secret which could destroy Rebecca's position in European settler society. If the secret is uncovered a life may be lost, but hiding it may also have fatal consequences. So Paraiti, Maraea and Rebecca become players in a head on clash of beliefs, deception and ultimate salvation.In the Extras of the DVD, Witi Ihimaera, tells how his mother took him to Paraiti, a tohunga/healer who cured him of a breathing problem. In writing the story, he wanted to honour the various tohunga in Maori life. In 1907, the New Zealand government brought in The Tohunga Suppression Act, thus outlawing natural healing for Maori.

Write a summary based on this article: Descendants of Solomon Northup are among those opposing plans to develop Shockoe Bottom in Richmond, Va. — where a busy slave-trading district once stood. Where the jail that held Solomon Northup once stood, a state-of-the-art baseball stadium may soon rise. That's if the mayor of Richmond, Va., has his way. But descendants of Northup -- whose astounding story served as the basis for the Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave -- are among those who oppose plans to develop Shockoe Bottom, a Richmond district that prior to the Civil War served as one of the country's busiest slave-trading centers. It was there that, in 1841, Northup was taken after being drugged by two vaudeville performers, later to be transported to New Orleans. PHOTOS: '12 Years a Slave': Portraits of Solomon Northup's Descendants The site once held over 90 slave dealers and the infamous Lumpkin's slave jail -- also known as \\"the Devil's half-acre\\" -- that held Northup at the start of his nightmarish voyage. All that now remains is a stretch of underdeveloped asphalt lots and grasslands, a less-than-desirable construction zone due in part to its proximity to the nearby Shockoe Creek. As proposed by Richmond's mayor, Dwight Jones, the plan seeks to revive the moribund area by erecting a 56 million park for the Richmond Flying Squirrels, the local minor league team. Another 5 million has been earmarked for the creation of an adjacent slavery museum. The nearby slave burial grounds, discovered in 2011 and designated a historical landmark by the city, will not be affected by the construction -- but dozens of slave-trading sites will be destroyed to make way for the Flying Squirrels' dream home. STORY: '12 Years a Slave': Solomon Northup's Descendants Gather for THR Photo Shoot, Reflect on His Legacy One vocal opponent of the project is school psychologist Linsey Williams, who takes great pride in her connection to Northup, her great-great-great-great-grandfather. (Williams was contacted by The Hollywood Reporter to take part in our historic reunion of five generations of the Northrup family tree, but was unable to attend.) \\"Most people of African descent in North America have had ancestors who came through that area as they were being sold to slave masters in the South,\\" she tells THR. \\"I think it's insensitive in allowing it to become secondary to a ballpark.\\" Williams has launched an online petition opposing the development and plans to join an April 3 protest held at the Lumpkin's site. Richmond historical researcher Elizabeth Kambourian fears that unknown treasures may be lost in the process. \\"An archaeological dig at the Lumpkin's jail turned up a lot of artifacts and things of interest,\\" she says. \\"They need to do more exploration down there and they need to commemorate.\\" VIDEO: '12 Years a Slave' Director Surprises Solomon Northup's Descendants During Emotional Photo Shoot But not everyone opposes the project. The Richmond Times-Dispatch ran an op-ed in favor of it, praising the proposed slavery museum. \\"A stadium appears to be a strong way to draw attention to slavery and to commemorate the lives of human beings held in bondage,\\" the newspaper argued. Kambourian isn't convinced: \\"I don't feel it's what is needed down there. There's a lot of museums in Richmond already. And they say they're going to build this one, but we don't really know what it would be.\\" Time is running out. Mayor Jones' 2015 budget calls for 13.6 million in infrastructure spending in anticipation of construction on the stadium, which the city council must adopt by the end of May. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

They are lycopods and the only genus in Isoetaceae. There are currently 192 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\", although molecular data place these species among other species of \\"Isoetes\\", so \\"Stylites\\" does not warrant taxonomic recognition. - Selaginella is the sole genus of vascular plants in the family Selaginellaceae, the spikemosses or lesser clubmosses. This family is placed in the class Isoetopsida, distinguished from the sister group Lycopodiopsida (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the \\"fern allies\\". \\"S. moellendorffii\\" is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name \\"Selaginella\\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \\"Selaginella selaginoides\\", which turns out (with the closely-related \\"Selaginella deflexa\\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginellas\\", so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in \\"Selaginella\\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera. - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds. - Isoetales, formerly also written Isoëtales, is an order of plants in the class Isoetopsida. There are about 140-150 living species, all of which are classified in the genus \\"Isoetes\\" (quillworts), with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope. - The U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), located in Walnut Creek, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Today the DOE JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). - The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \\"Baragwanathia\\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants. - A ligule (from \\"strap\\", variant of \\"lingula\\", from \\"lingua\\" \\"tongue\\") is a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae. - Ambroise Marie François Joseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois (27 July 1752, Arras 21 January 1820, Paris) was a French naturalist. - The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories. - Selaginella selaginoides is a non-flowering plant of the spikemoss genus \\"Selaginella\\" with a wide distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, \\"Selaginella deflexa\\", native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginella\\" species. - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta. - A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution. - The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta. All extant species belong to the genus \\"Selaginella\\" in the order Selaginellales or to the genus \\"Isoetes\\" in the order Isoetales. In the past, members of this group sometimes have been placed in the classes Isoetopsida, Selaginellopsida, or Lycopodiopsida. There are c. 700 species of \\"Selaginella\\" and 140-150 species of \\"Isoetes\\", with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split \\"Isoetes\\" by separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\". - The Lycopodiopsida are a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies . Traditionally , the group included not only the clubmosses and firmosses , but also the spikemosses ( Selaginella and relatives ) and the quillworts ( Isoetes and relatives ) . However , the latter are now usually placed into a separate class , Isoetopsida . Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants , with small , scale - like leaves , homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves , branching stems ( usually dichotomous ) , and generally simple form . The class Lycopodiopsida as interpreted here contains a single living order , the Lycopodiales , and a single extinct order , the Drepanophycales . What is the relationship between 'lycopodiopsida' and 'lycopodiophyta'? Answer:","completion":"Lycopodiopsida and Lycopodiophyta both refer to the same group of plants, which is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. These terms are used interchangeably to describe this group of plants, which is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants. They are characterized by their reproduction through shedding spores, macroscopic alternation of generations, and having microphylls, leaves with only a single vascular trace (vein), unlike the more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: Three males are walking across a field. Hypothesis: Three males are walking across a green field. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"We cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, as there is not enough information provided in the premise to support all elements of the hypothesis. Let's break down the key differences between the premise and hypothesis to analyze this further. Premise: Three males are walking across a field. Hypothesis: Three males are walking across a green field. The premise provides information about the situation in which three males are walking across a field, but it does not specify the color or any other characteristics of the field. The hypothesis, on the other hand, adds a detail that the field is green, which is not present in the premise. To support the hypothesis, we would need additional information that confirms the color of the field as being green. Without this specific detail, we cannot draw a direct conclusion that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise. If, for example, the premise stated, \\"Three males are walking across a green field,\\" the premise and hypothesis would match, and we could conclude that the hypothesis is true. In its current form, however, the premise provides incomplete information to confirm or deny the correctness of the hypothesis. Suppose the premise only mentioned that three males were walking across a field. In that case, the field could potentially be green, brown, yellow, or any other color depending on various factors such as the climate, vegetation, time of year, and geographical location. To conclude the hypothesis as true based on the premise, we would need information specifically regarding the field's color. In summary, while the premise of \\"Three males are walking across a field\\" does setup a similar scenario as the hypothesis, it does not provide enough details to confirm that the field is, in fact, green. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the hypothesis is true based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Paragraph: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less? A:","completion":"Asafa will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles less. Justification: The background information provided indicates that exercises like running cause the cardiac muscle to contract faster, thereby increasing its strength and efficiency. In the paragraph, Usain is described as running frequently while Asafa hardly runs at all.

Moscow (CNN)More than 1 million historic documents have been destroyed in a fire at one of Russia's largest public libraries, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. The Russian emergency situations ministry says 147 firefighters struggled for 25 hours over the weekend to put out the blaze in the main library of the Institute for Research Information on Social Sciences in Moscow. The fire, which ripped through the library Friday evening, destroyed 2,000 square meters (about 2,400 square yards) of the building and caused part of the roof to collapse, according to an official statement. The Russian emergency situations ministry said the fire was particularly hard to put out because of the high temperatures, narrow passageways and the risk of the building falling down. Moscow's emergency ministry said the temperature inside the rubble of the library remains high and that there is still a threat that the building could collapse. Vladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the fire, which destroyed 15% of all the documents in the library, reminded him of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. \\"It's a major loss for science.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

You are given a new situation: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. and a hint : Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Please answer this question : Which of the two areas was more oxygenated? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Area B was more oxygenated. To justify this answer, the given information is as follows: 1. Area A has high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharge by the Danube River. 2. Area B has less stratified water and is located 35 miles south. 3. Water stratification can create barriers to nutrient and oxygen mixing between the layers, leading to limited primary production and lower net productivity. From the given information, it is clear that water stratification poses a barrier to oxygen mixing. Since Area A has high levels of water stratification, it is less likely to have efficient oxygen mixing, resulting in lower oxygen levels. On the other hand, Area B has less stratified water, which allows better mixing of oxygen between the layers, resulting in a more oxygenated environment. Thus, Area B is more oxygenated than Area A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented involves a change in plant acid levels in the soil and its potential effect on virus replication within a host body. Based on the information provided, there does not seem to be a direct or clear connection between plant acid levels in the soil and the process of viral replication within a host organism. The virus replication process occurs within host cells and typically does not involve the external environment, such as plant acid levels in the soil. It is possible that changes in plant acid levels could have indirect effects on host organisms or their environments, which might ultimately influence their susceptibility to viruses. For example, altered plant acid levels could affect plant growth or food sources for various species, impacting their overall health. A weakened host organism might be more vulnerable to viral infections, meaning that although the specific process of viral replication remains unchanged, the host organism's weakened state could make it easier for the virus to spread. Overall, while there might be indirect effects to consider, there is no clear direct connection between plant acid levels in the soil and the process of virus replication within a host organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man.

'I think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated,' she writes.","completion":"Title: The Story of McKenna Peterson: Battling Gender Stereotypes in the Sporting World Introduction In an era where every individual, irrespective of gender, aims to make an impact in various fields, one 12-year-old girl's voice reverberates across the nation to fight for gender equality in sports. McKenna Peterson, a young and passionate basketball enthusiast, took a stand and voiced her concerns about the representation of women in sports catalogs. In this article, we recount her courageous step, the implications of her fiery letter to Dick's Sporting Goods, and the pressing need to break away from gender stereotypes. The Fiery Letter by McKenna Peterson In a significant move, McKenna Peterson, an ardent basketball fan, decided to speak up when she found that women were notably missing in Dick's Sporting Goods Basketball 2014 catalog. Through her heartfelt and passionate letter, she expressed her anger about how girls were only shown sitting in the stands, illustrating the struggles they face while trying to break into sports that are traditionally associated with men. McKenna boldly states, \\"So, back to the point, There are NO girls in the catalog! Oh, wait, sorry. There IS a girl in the catalog. SITTING in the STANDS.\\" She further goes on to emphasize the importance of treating boys and girls equally in the world of sports. As she writes, \\"I think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated,\\" imploring the need for an unbiased representation of athletes in the media. The Representation Gap in Sports Marketing McKenna Peterson's letter successfully highlighted the representation gap that exists in sports marketing. The unequal representation of female athletes in sports catalogs, advertisements, and promotional materials has long been an issue, fostering gender stereotypes and contributing to the misconception that certain sports are better suited for men. This lack of diversity makes it challenging for young girls to find role models and aspire to excel in a male-dominated field. It also reinforces the archaic belief that women are only meant to cheer on the sidelines. By questioning these practices, McKenna sparked an essential conversation that needs the attention of both sports enthusiasts and industry leaders. Breaking Gender Stereotypes in Sports As we applaud McKenna Peterson's initiative in addressing the equality issue in sports, it is time for us as a society to work towards breaking these stereotypes. Encouraging and supporting female athletes at every level, from school teams to professional leagues, is vital for redefining gender norms and sports culture. Companies like Dick's Sporting Goods and other sports brands must consider increasing their representation of female athletes in marketing materials and product endorsements. Additionally, empowering young girls to participate in diverse sports will lead to widespread acceptance and support for female athletes. Conclusion The courageous move by McKenna Peterson to voice her concerns about the lack of women players in sports catalogs signifies that change can begin at any age. By recognizing and addressing the inherent gender biases in the sports industry, we contribute to empowering girls, fostering fair representation, and inspiring future athletes to chase their dreams, regardless of their gender. It is our collective responsibility to confront these gender stereotypes and create a more inclusive sports environment for our future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, Jesse is a lawyer advising Tracy on a court case involving murder and a life sentence. Thus, Jesse's role is that of legal counsel and representation for Tracy, who is likely the defendant in the case. Based on the provided information, Jesse is not on trial, nor is Jesse implicated in the crime. As a lawyer providing legal representation and counsel, Jesse is fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Unless there is evidence suggesting that Jesse has acted unethically, illegally, or has been directly involved in the crime in question, there is no reason to believe that Jesse would be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. Now, let us consider the question: \\"What will happen to Jesse?\\" The focus of the question involves the fate of Jesse, not Tracy. Given the available information, it is not accurate to respond with \\"found guilty,\\" as this answer implies that Jesse is on trial for criminal charges, which is not the case. Jesse's professional role as a legal counsel does not automatically implicate him in his client's alleged crimes, especially without any evidence suggesting otherwise. A more appropriate answer to the question of what will happen to Jesse could be framed in terms of his professional involvement in the case, such as the possible outcomes of Tracy's trial, the potential impact on Jesse's career, or any risks associated with representing a client in a high-profile and serious case like this. For instance, if Jesse successfully defends Tracy and secures a favorable outcome, it could bolster his reputation within the legal community or lead to additional high-profile cases. Conversely, if Jesse is not successful in his defense, this could impact his career trajectory or possibly lead to negative public perception or scrutiny. Additionally, depending on the complexity and high-profile nature of the case, Jesse may face professional and personal challenges such as stress, long hours, and moral dilemmas. In conclusion, without any evidence that Jesse has acted unethically or unlawfully, or that he is implicated in the crime, the assertion that he would be \\"found guilty\\" is not a valid answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" and the situation: Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas. They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. Answer the following question: Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in Nicaragua than in England? Answer:","completion":"The stability of ecosystem functions can be influenced by numerous factors, including biodiversity, environmental conditions, and human activities. Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua and England may exhibit differing levels of stability due to the substantial differences in biodiversity between the two countries. Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas, with a rich variety of flora and fauna inhabiting its diverse landscapes. The vast array of species provides a complex web of interdependencies among the organisms, enhancing the overall stability of the ecosystem functions. Higher levels of biodiversity contribute to the capture of biologically essential resources, increased biomass production, and more efficient decomposition and recycling of nutrients. Furthermore, greater biodiversity may lead to a higher likelihood of key species and diverse functional traits being present, which can positively influence the overall productivity and resilience of the ecological communities in the face of environmental changes. In essence, the high biodiversity in Nicaragua may form an ecosystem that is less susceptible to disturbances, more resilient to stressors, and better equipped to maintain optimal functioning through time. Conversely, England has experienced significant declines in biodiversity due to extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawl. As a result, the country ranks among the least biodiverse in the world. Reduced biodiversity can have detrimental effects on the stability of ecosystem functions, as the loss of species and functional diversity may compromise the ability of ecosystems to efficiently capture essential resources, produce biomass, and decompose and recycle nutrients. Additionally, less diverse ecosystems may be more vulnerable to environmental disturbances, less resilient to stressors, and may not have the necessary resources or mechanisms in place to maintain optimal functioning. Consequently, the low biodiversity in England might contribute to a less stable ecosystem compared to Nicaragua. In conclusion, it is reasonable to assert that the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua would likely exhibit higher levels of stability compared to those in England, mainly due to the stark contrast in biodiversity between the two countries. Nicaragua's rich biodiversity fosters resilience and strengthens the ability of ecological communities to maintain balanced ecosystem functions, whereas the lower biodiversity seen in England results in reduced stability and adaptability within their ecosystems. However, it is important to consider various contexts and factors contributing to the overall stability of ecosystem functions, as other elements such as regional climate, human activity, and unique habitat characteristics may also play a significant role in influencing ecosystem stability beyond the scope of biodiversity alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed states that if the pancakes are larger, there will be less pancakes made. This hypothesis does have a direct effect on the process, as it changes the size of the pancakes being made, which in turn affects the number of pancakes produced from a given amount of batter. When making larger pancakes using the same process mentioned above, you will have to adjust certain steps: 1. Mix pancake mix with water: This step remains the same since you will still need to prepare the batter as per the instructions on the pancake mix. 2. Heat a griddle: There is no change in this step as well. 3. Pour a circle of batter in the griddle: You will need to pour more batter onto the griddle to make larger pancakes. This will require keeping the size of the circle consistent to ensure even cooking and desired thickness. 4. When most of the bubbles pop on the surface, flip: The time needed to cook the larger pancakes may slightly increase due to their size. Make sure to monitor the bubbles and the edges of the pancake so that you can flip it at the right time. 5. Cook to desired color: The cooking time on the second side may also increase a bit to reach the desired color and ensure the pancake is cooked through. 6. Apply butter, syrup, and enjoy: This step remains the same, with the consideration that you might require more butter and syrup for larger pancakes. The key effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the process is the possible increase in cooking time and the need to pour more batter onto the griddle for each pancake. As a result, the total number of pancakes produced from a given batch of batter will be reduced if they are made larger. This reduction in the number of pancakes supports the initial assumption made in the perturbation hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint. Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","completion":"House A would be more likely to cause brain damage than House B due to the presence of lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint. Lead is a toxic substance that can cause severe health problems, particularly in children. Prolonged exposure to lead can lead to intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, and other health issues, including damage to the brain and nervous system. In adults, lead exposure can also lead to fertility problems, high blood pressure, and kidney damage. House A, built in the 1920s, has both lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint. As lead-containing materials deteriorate over time, lead particles from the pipes and paint may contaminate the water supply and become airborne as dust, posing a risk for occupants inhaling or ingesting the lead particles. This could lead to lead poisoning and an increased likelihood of brain damage. House B, on the other hand, is a more modern build and does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead-based paint. With the absence of lead in the construction materials, the risk of lead exposure significantly decreases, making it less likely to cause brain damage in comparison to House A.

Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

Options: a ) 2.8 % , b ) 3.0 % , c ) 3.2 % , d ) 3.4 % , e ) 3.6 % A:","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of marbles from jar A that need to be moved to jar B to make both jars have the same number of marbles. Let's represent the number of marbles in jar B as x. Since jar A has 6% more marbles than jar B, we can represent the number of marbles in jar A as 1.06x. In order for both jars to have equal marbles, let's say, each jar will have y marbles. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 1.06x - m = y x + m = y Where m is the number of marbles to be moved from jar A to jar B. From the above two equations, we can substitute y: 1.06x - m = x + m Now, we need to solve for m: 0.06x = 2m m = 0.03x Now, to find the percentage of marbles from jar A that need to be moved to jar B, we need to divide m by the total number of marbles in jar A (1.06x) and multiply the result by 100: (m / 1.06x) * 100 = (0.03x / 1.06x) * 100 = (0.03 / 1.06) * 100 ≈ 2.83% Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.8%, which corresponds to option (a)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for a scent that adds to your style and complements your overall presentation. A great scent is one you don't mind smelling all day. It shouldn't be too strong, since some people are sensitive to overpowering smells. Experiment with different scents until you find a few you like. You can wear the same scent every day or rotate between a few. Different scents are great for different occasions. A citrusy, floral, sweet scent might be great for daytime wear, while you might choose something musky and a bit stronger to wear at night. If you're looking for a more masculine scent, go for a cologne with notes of fir, cedar and sandalwood. Scents change depending on who is wearing them. They interact with your unique body chemistry and change a little throughout the day. It's something to keep in mind when you're picking out a scent - one that works for your friend might not smell the same way on you. You can also use a scent in the form of lotion or body oil, if you prefer. Solid perfume is another popular choice. Don't bathe yourself in your chosen scent. Use it strategically, so people nearby get small whiffs, but don't feel overwhelmed. A little goes a long way, especially if you're using real perfume. Put some on your wrists, neck, and behind your ears - that's probably all you need. If you're using a spray bottle, don't spray it directly on your body at a close range. Hold the bottle several inches from your body and spray lightly, then move your wrist or other body part into the mist. Even if you're using scented lotion, you probably don't want to slather it all over your body. Just use it in a few places, like your hands and neck. Use an unscented lotion to moisturize the rest of your skin. If your shampoo doesn't have much of a smell, you might want to add a bit of scent to your hair. This is a nice, subtle way to keep you smelling great all day long. Rub a little perfume or essential oil between your palms, then smooth it gently through your hair. Alternatively, you could add a few drops of your favorite scent to your unscented shampoo or conditioner. It's not a good idea to wear 3 - 4 warring scents that leave a smelly trail in your wake when you walk down the hall. Instead of asking you the name of your perfume, people will pinch their noses when they see you coming! Just wear one main scent at a time. That means that if you have a strongly-scented lotion, you shouldn't also wear perfume, and vice versa. Be sure you aren't accidentally wearing too many scents. Your deodorant, hairspray, and lip balm might all be scented. Try to choose unscented products and stick to one or two main scents. If you don't want to splurge on a bottle of perfume or cologne, you can make your own scent! Purchase a few different essential oils, like rose, lavender, lemongrass or vetiver, and use a few drops instead of perfume. You can even make your own perfume blend by mixing several different essential oils together until you come up with something you like. To find essential oils, check out health food stores. They're usually in the body care section. You can dilute your essential oil mix with water or vodka so that it doesn't smell as strong. Put it in a spray bottle and use it on your body and hair. Summary:","completion":"Choose a versatile scent that complements your style, taking into consideration its strength, your body chemistry, and occasion; use it strategically and avoid combining multiple scents, while also considering alternatives like essential oils or unscented products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Locate a base sprite of the pokémon of your choice and copy it to your clipboard (or save it). Hypothesis: Pick a pokemon that is rainbow colored to make this easier.","completion":"Based on the context provided, the hypothesis that picking a rainbow-colored Pokémon would make the recoloring process easier is not fully supported. In the context, it is suggested to choose Pokémon with simpler color schemes for recoloring, such as Voltorb, Oddish, and Wigglytuff. These Pokémon have relatively fewer colors and simpler designs in their appearances, which can make editing and recoloring more straightforward for beginners. A rainbow-colored Pokémon, on the other hand, would have a more complex color scheme with multiple color transitions and gradients. This could make the recoloring process more challenging for those who are new to sprite editing or inexperienced in color modification. In this case, it is important to practice with simpler Pokémon first to gain experience and familiarity with the process of recoloring before moving on to more intricate and complex designs. To summarize, the hypothesis generated from the context provided does not fully align with the suggestions made. The context recommends choosing Pokémon with simpler color schemes for beginners, making the process of recoloring easier and more manageable. Selecting a rainbow-colored Pokémon could potentially make the task more difficult due to the complexity of its design and the increased number of colors involved. Therefore, it is advisable to start with simpler Pokémon and gradually work towards more complex designs as one gains experience and mastery of the recoloring process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Take it easy the rest of the day.","completion":"Title: Taking Care of Yourself After a Fun Sauna Experience Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about something that grown-ups like to do sometimes, called going to the sauna. The sauna is a warm and cozy room where people sit to relax and feel good. But after they leave the sauna, there are some important things they should do to take care of themselves. Let's find out what these things are! 1. Air Dry Your Skin When you come out of the sauna, your skin will be all warm and maybe a little sweaty. That's okay! The best way to help your skin feel all nice and fresh again is just to let the air outside the sauna dry your skin. This means not using a towel to dry off, but just waiting for the air to do the job. This way, your skin can go back to feeling cool and happy. 2. Drink Water Throughout the Day Playing and having fun can make you thirsty, right? Just like that, spending time in the sauna can make your body need more water. So, it's important to drink lots of water after visiting the sauna. Make sure to drink not only right after coming out, but also throughout the day. This will help your body stay healthy and strong. 3. Eat a Snack or Light Meal After you've spent some time having fun in the sauna, your body might need some energy! Instead of having a big meal, it's a good idea to have a small snack or eat something that isn't too heavy. You can choose fruits, nuts, or even a sandwich. This way, you can give your body the energy it needs without making it feel too full or tired. 4. Take It Easy the Rest of the Day Grown-ups sometimes need to relax too, just like you! After their time in the sauna, it's important for them to allow their bodies to rest. This means not doing things that are too hard or too tiring for the rest of the day. They can read a book, watch a movie, or just sit and chat with their friends. This way, their bodies can feel all refreshed and have lots of energy for another fun day! So, now you know what grown-ups should do after they have a fun time in the sauna. Remember, taking good care of our bodies is important for everyone, no matter how old we are! Maybe one day, when you're older, you can give the sauna a try too and follow these steps to make sure you feel great afterwards."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Summarize this article: Proposals for The Gate shopping centre in Durham include new retail, leisure and cinema outlets and student flats. Durham University said there was no need for extra accommodation beyond what was already planned elsewhere. Residents' groups and the City of Durham Trust also opposed the plans, which have attracted some support. Objections concern the location of bicycle racks, late-night noise and anti-social behaviour and the impact on the World Heritage Site. Supporters welcomed the redevelopment of a \\"neglected\\" area and said the effect of students would be felt less by residents on this site than elsewhere. But, in comments submitted to planners, the university said the development \\"would perpetuate an unbalanced residential population where one community group (in this case a temporary population of students) dominates to the exclusion of other types of resident\\". The 40-year-old shopping centre went into administration two years ago and was bought by London-based developer Clearbell Capital LLP for almost Â£12m. Councillors are recommended to approve the proposals at a meeting on 6 October.

Answer the above question based on the context below: According to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are: Major manufacturers in Grand Forks include wind turbine manufacturer LM Glasfiber and light aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design. Major food producers include potato processor J. R. Simplot Company and the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator which is the largest flour mill in the United States. Amazon.com and SEI Information Technologies both operate call centers in Grand Forks. Other large private employers in the city include the locally owned Alerus Financial branch of banks, Home of Economy, and the locally owned Hugo's chain of supermarkets.The retail and service sector is also an important part of the economy. The historic center of shopping in Grand Forks was the downtown area. Today, downtown is home to small shops and restaurants and south Grand Forks has become the major retail district in the city. Grand Forks has three large shopping centers. The oldest, Grand Cities Mall, is on South Washington Street and contains mainly small, locally owned stores as well as a Kmart. With about 80 stores, the area's largest indoor mall is Columbia Mall which is anchored by Scheels, Sears, J.C. Penney, and a small food court. The newest major shopping center in the city is the Grand Forks Marketplace power center mall which features SuperTarget, Best Buy, Lowe's, Gordmans, and several smaller stores.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"To validate this answer, you would need to look into the current ownership of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, since the suggested answer does not really mention the name of the entity that owns the fast food chain. It just describes when and where the fast food chain was founded. So, the steps to validate would be: 1. Check the current ownership of Popeyes: For this, you could use online resources, looking up reliable sources like news articles, company databases, or the official website of Popeyes. Sources such as Wikipedia, Forbes, and business news websites usually have accurate and current information about company ownership. 2. Compare information found with the proposed answer: Once you have found who currently owns Popeyes, you could compare this information with the suggested answer. Depending on what you find, you could then conclude if the suggested answer is correct or not. Based on my current knowledge, Popeyes is owned by Restaurant Brands International, a company that also owns other food chains like Burger King and Tim Hortons.

Based on the premise \\"they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Our community papers have been flourishing thanks to the new development.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, it is difficult to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Our community papers have been flourishing thanks to the new development\\" is true. The premise states that several places were involved in the production of community papers but stopped because the activity was not profitable. This information suggests that the community papers may have encountered challenges or lacked enough demand to generate profits. To better assess the hypothesis that community papers are flourishing due to new development, it is crucial to consider several factors that can support or challenge the assertion. These factors may include: 1. Current circulation numbers and demand for community papers: A higher readership, growing demand, and an increased circulation of community papers may support the hypothesis that the community papers are thriving. 2. Advertising revenue and local business involvement: Community papers typically rely on local businesses for advertising revenues. If these revenues have increased, it can provide evidence that the papers are flourishing alongside the new development. 3. Quality and diversity of content: Greater coverage of local news, events, and stories, as well as higher-quality content that resonates with readers, can be seen as signs of a flourishing community paper. 4. Online presence and digital adaptation: The ability to adapt to online platforms and meet the changing reading habits of audiences can be an indicator of success and longevity for community papers. 5. Community engagement: A strong connection with the community and readership can contribute to the success of a community paper. Engaging in activities such as workshops, local events, and educational programs can indicate that the papers are flourishing. 6. Financial performance: If the community papers have shown improvements in financial performance, through increased subscriptions, advertising revenues, or additional funding sources, this may indicate that they are flourishing thanks to the new development. To make a more informed conclusion about the hypothesis, it would be necessary to gather information about these factors and analyze them in relation to the growth of the new development. However, the given premise, which mentions previously unprofitable paper production, does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively conclude that community papers are flourishing due to the new development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta? - Any time - it'll have better structure - not enough information - Only when needed - the ricotta in the tub is just as good - There is no right type of ricotta Answer:","completion":"The author suggests using the right type of ricotta any time when making Tuscan gnudi. It is important to use \\"proper\\" ricotta, the real deal, which is made fresh, has a good structure, and is devoid of unnecessary additives or gums typically found in supermarket tubs of ricotta. According to the author, using the proper ricotta greatly impacts the outcome of the dish, ensuring the gnudi hold their shape and do not dissolve in the pot while simmering. The emphasis on choosing the right type of ricotta highlights the importance of using high-quality, authentic ingredients for a successful and delicious result."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Above image by Annie Fischinger (creative commons license) Guest Post by Nathaniel J. Dominy, Professor of Anthropology and Biological Sciences, Dartmouth College; OpEd Project Public Voices Fellow (Full bio below this post) Robert L. May graduated from Dartmouth College in 1926 and soon afterwards published a classic monograph of animal social behavior, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. May reported observations of reindeer disporting themselves and excluding an individual, Rudolph, for having a uniquely large, red nose. The radiance of this nose, which May described as “dazzling” in daylight and “glowing” at night, later proved advantageous on Christmas Eve, when thick Arctic fog disrupted the flight preparations of Santa Claus and his team of eight reindeer. Under these conditions, Rudolph’s nose produced sufficient light for safe aviation and the global distribution of gifts (Figure 1 below). This account of Rudolph’s nose and its brilliance under specific atmospheric conditions is familiar to most biologists, but it is also viewed as a spurious anatomical novelty, which could explain why the sensory ecology of luminescent noses is practically unstudied. New findings on the color vision of reindeer may elucidate the potential selective advantages of a luminescent nose. For example, it was discovered recently that the vision of Arctic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, a rare trait among diurnal mammals. The ecological function of this visual sensitivity is uncertain, but it could enhance the ability of reindeer to detect objects that absorb UV light, such as predators and plant foods, against a background of snow cover, which reflects UV light to different extents. The potential fitness benefits of discriminating UV-absorbing targets could be greatest in mid-winter, when the sun is low on the horizon and high atmospheric (Rayleigh) scattering produces UV-enriched light. Still more surprising is the unparalleled plasticity of reindeer eyes, which change color seasonally. The tapetum lucidum of the retina (the reflective tissue responsible for “eye shine”) shifts from a rich golden color during the summer months to a deep blue color during the winter months, perhaps to increase visual sensitivity to shorter (bluer) wavelengths under dim (mesopic) conditions. Taken together, these recent findings point to a specialized visual system and ecology that is strikingly suboptimal for late-December fog. Light transmission in fog Fog is an aggregation of suspended water droplets or ice crystals immediately above the surface of the Earth. It forms when moist air is cooled below its dew point or frost point and some of the water vapor condenses; and, by definition, human visibility is < 1000 m. Robert May described ground fog “as thick as white fizz” and near zero visibility (it was “dark and drear“), which suggests one of two possible fog types: radiation fog or ice fog. Radiation fog is produced when the ground cools the air above it by contact. Ice fog occurs when warm air interacts with extremely cold air and the water vapor sublimates, or changes directly into a solid, to form tiny ice crystals suspended in the air. The opacity of fog is wavelength-dependent. Longer (redder) wavelengths travel farthest, but the distance varies as an inverse function of droplet size. If the droplet sizes exceed the wavelength of light, then Mie scattering extinguishes all light regardless of wavelength. Such scatter prevails in most fog types, rendering them optically opaque, but a red luminescent nose is predicted to outshine any other kind of nose, with greater transmission in ice fog (typical ice particles: < 10 μm) than radiation fog (typical droplet sizes: 10-20 μm). To explore the extent to which Rudolph’s nose might be optimized for vision in fog, it is necessary to know the spectral composition of the radiant light. The color of Rudolph’s nose A clue to the color, or chromaticity, of Rudolph’s nose emerged in Barbara Hazen’s (1958) adaptation of May’s original work. In this version, Rudolph hides behind a holly hedge so that “his bright red nose blended in with the bright red berries.” Figure 2 (below) illustrates this episode and the reflectance spectra of ripe holly fruits (Ilex aquifolium). If we assume that such spectra are representative of Arctic holly fruits, and we assume a similar radiant spectrum from Rudolph’s nose, then we can estimate radiant light with spectral peak of ca. 700 nm. Such a peak is not only supremely red, but also the maximum redness visible to most mammals. Such conjecture on the color of Rudolph’s nose is necessarily speculative, but it does suggest a nose that is optimized for light transmission in fog, particularly in late December when reindeer eyes are sensitized to seeing blue wavelengths that attenuate rapidly in fog. Reindeer, then, appear to have greater need for a red fog light than other mammals, which could explain why Rudolph’s nose was so effective for aviation in thick fog. Expected increases in efficiency and safety during long-distance flight could confer fitness benefits; however, these advantages may be offset by high thermal costs. The noses of reindeer have a rich microvascular system and are therefore quite warm, a trait that prevents freezing but results in substantial heat loss. Excessive heat radiation in his glowing nose could put Rudolph at risk of hypothermia under cold weather conditions. It is therefore imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to replenish Rudolph’s low energetic reserves on Christmas Eve. On balance, the selective advantages of a red luminescent nose appear to outweigh the costs, which raises questions about the frequency of the trait in the population. It may be on the rise; however, the frequency of fog is decreasing worldwide, a pattern that may offset the occasional selective advantages of a luminescent nose. Another hypothesis holds that Rudolph’s red nose is infected with nasal parasites and simply inflamed. Such contrasting hypotheses invite testing, and it is hoped that future research on the optical properties of Arctic light and fog will shed, dare I say, new light, on the extraordinary biology and sensory ecology of reindeer.

Filed under: satire, holiday spirit Nathaniel Dominy is a Professor in the Departments of Anthropology and Biological Sciences at Dartmouth College. His research is focused on the functional ecology and anatomy of humans and nonhuman primates, with a specific interest in how these organisms discern, acquire, and assimilate edible tissues. The present blog post, his first, was motivated by his four-year-old daughter, Eleanor, who asked, “Why don’t all reindeer have glowing noses?” ||||| Here are the scientific benefits of Rudolph’s red nose by Brian Galloway Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer absolutely had a very shiny nose, but did it really help him find his way through a foggy Christmas Eve sky? The study was recently published in the journal Frontiers For Young Minds, a journal focused on answering questions aimed at children in hopes of stimulating an interest in science. Nathaniel J. Dominy is a professor of Anthroplogy at Dartmouth who claims Rudolph’s effectiveness comes from the Arctic reindeer’s special vision. Dominy claims that “New findings about the color vision of reindeer could hold important clues about the value of a luminescent nose.” Reindeer can see in the ultraviolet spectrum which is invisible to humans, but it helps reindeer spot important things such as predators and food. This is important because the sun’s position in the sky during an arctic winter casts much more UV-light than normal, so being able to see UV rays would allow Rudolph to lead the sleigh more effectively. The reindeer’s eyes also adjust to see different types of light depending on the season—yellows and reds during the summer and blues during the winter. Fog would block out most blue light, so Rudolph’s red nose is necessary to see through the fog. Such a vascular nose would lose heat very quickly in the cold winter air, so Dominy claims in a statement that “it is imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to help Rudolph replenish his energetic reserves of Christmas Eve.” So please don’t forget to put out some Christmas cookies for Santa and his team of reindeer. Dominy claims that the frequency of foggy weather is declining worldwide due to climate change, but there’s still a chance that Rudolph’s luminescent nose will be necessary on this Christmas Eve. ----- Feature Image: DreamWorks Classics ||||| \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" is by the Robert L. May, Dartmouth class of 1926. Credit: Rauner Special Collections Library, Dartmouth. We're all familiar with the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer by Robert L. May (a class of 1926 Dartmouth alumnus) but scientifically speaking, what are the optical benefits of a shiny red nose on a foggy Christmas Eve? In a paper just published by Frontiers for Young Minds, Nathaniel J. Dominy, Professor of Anthropology at Dartmouth, explores this very question. By citing research by other scientists on the unique eyes and vision of Arctic reindeer, Dominy explains why Rudolph is able to lead Santa and his team of eight tiny reindeer through the thick Arctic fog. Dominy points out that Arctic reindeer (scientific name Rangifer tarandus tarandus) can see ultraviolet light, which is invisible to humans and most mammals—a trait that comes especially handy in mid-winter when the sun is low on the horizon and the high scattered light from the atmosphere is mainly blueish and ultraviolet. In addition, the reflective tissue (tapetum lucidum) in reindeer eyes changes from a rich golden color during the summer months to a deep blue color during the winter months. This tissue (which causes eye shine at night) helps nocturnal animals see in the dark, and a blue one is expected to improve their ability to see blue light. Yet, fog extinguishes blue light more readily than red light, which may make it especially difficult for Santa's reindeer to see blue effectively, never mind fly. This is where Rudolph's luminescent (glowing) nose comes into play, as it serves as an excellent fog light for navigating his fellow reindeer. Given that the redness of Rudolph's nose is similar to red holly berries, Dominy was able to estimate the color of light emitted from Rudolph's nose by measuring the color of holly berries. He found that Rudolph's nose is probably the maximum level of redness that mammals are able to see, which may explain why Rudolph's nose is effective as a fog light.

According to Dominy, Rudolph's nose also poses a problem. Reindeer noses are extremely vascular, which causes them to lose body heat through their noses. A glowing nose could cause excessive heat loss for Rudolph, putting him at risk of hypothermia. \\"It is therefore imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to help Rudolph replenish his energetic reserves on Christmas Eve,\\" says Dominy. As a result of the unique properties of Rudolph, it is no wonder that with a nose so bright, he is able to effectively guide Santa's sleigh.

Select the topic that this about: Property and casualty insurers such as State Farm and The Hartford have invested in wireless and other technologies to streamline claims processing for policyholders affected by recent hurricanes.","completion":"Property and casualty insurers have faced significant challenges in recent years due to an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. The devastation caused by these calamities has placed immense pressure on insurers to quickly and efficiently process claims for policyholders in need. As a result, major insurance companies like State Farm and The Hartford have turned to innovative technologies, particularly wireless and other communications technologies, to streamline the claims process. These advancements have not only helped insurers meet the overwhelming demand for claims processing, but they have also improved the experiences of policyholders during some of the most difficult times in their lives. Some of the technologies that property and casualty insurers have invested in include: 1. Mobile applications: Many insurers have developed mobile apps that allow policyholders to file claims, upload photos of damage, and track the progress of their claims. These apps can provide real-time updates and make it easier for customers to access the information and support they need without having to call or visit a local office. Moreover, these apps often incorporate features that allow policyholders to access additional resources and assistance, such as finding nearby shelters or navigating evacuation routes. 2. Drones and aerial imagery: The use of drones and aerial imagery has been a game-changer for insurers handling claims following a natural disaster. Drones can capture high-quality images of damage in areas that are difficult to access or too dangerous for adjusters to enter. This technology not only accelerates the claims process but also provides better documentation and a more accurate assessment of damages. 3. Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home devices: Smart home devices, such as connected security systems, water sensors, and weather stations, provide real-time data that can be invaluable for insurers during a disaster. This data can help insurance companies quickly identify the extent of the damage and prioritize which claims need immediate attention. Insurers can also use this information to provide policyholders with alerts and advice on how to mitigate potential damage during a natural disaster, thereby reducing the overall cost of claims. 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning: AI and machine learning technologies have been increasingly used by insurers to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that can help improve the claims process. For example, machine learning algorithms can quickly assess damage in aerial images, or even recognize fraud attempts in claim submissions. This technology enables insurers to allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring that legitimate claims are processed promptly and accurately. 5. Video assessment and communication tools: Remote video assessment and communication tools have become invaluable for claims adjusters in the wake of natural disasters. Adjusters can now conduct virtual inspections of damaged properties via video chat or by reviewing recordings provided by policyholders. This allows for faster, more efficient assessments and eliminates the need for adjusters to physically visit and inspect each property. These technological advancements have significantly improved the claims processing experience for both policyholders and insurers. By leveraging these cutting-edge tools and platforms, property and casualty insurers can process claims more quickly, provide better support and assistance to policyholders, and minimize the negative impacts of natural disasters on their business operations. Additionally, the adoption of these technologies underscores the importance of continuous innovation within the insurance industry to remain agile and responsive in an increasingly unpredictable world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Peter Boddy, 65, admitted selling 55 horses from his abattoir, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, and accepting 17 animals without keeping proper records. He told Southwark Crown Court some of the meat went to Italian restaurants. Boddy was also ordered to pay more than £10,442 in costs after admitting breaching EU regulations. Slaughterhouse manager David Moss was given a four-month suspended sentence for forging an invoice relating to the sale of horses in February 2013. Sentencing the pair, Judge Alistair McCreath said: \\"The traceability of food products, here meat, is of critical importance in relation to public health. \\"If meat causes ill health then it is important that those responsible for investigating the cause of it should quickly be able to discover where the meat came from and trace it backwards... to find where the problem lies and prevent the problem escalating.\\" Adam Payter, prosecuting, said it was a requirement for slaughterhouses to keep a record of where they bought their meat and where they sold it. Boddy's failure was uncovered during a Food Standards Agency (FSA) investigation into abattoirs known to slaughter horses. Mr Payter said that in early 2013 the FSA asked Boddy, of East Hey Head Farm, Todmorden for documents in relation to the traceability of horse carcasses at the business during 2012. Initial documents, provided by Moss, of Higher Moss, West Yorkshire, were considered \\"inadequate\\" and did not show where a number of horses had gone or where they had come from. However, on that occasion Moss - who the prosecution say was acting as manager on the day - conceded that some of the horsemeat had been sold \\"cash in hand\\". The FSA then asked for delivery notes or invoices and a few days later Moss provided a forged invoice. Mr Payter said: \\"The prosecution say that in relation to horses that were slaughtered on the site, there were FSA records for those; in relation to other horses that were not in the FSA records - there were not proper records for those horses. \\"It can't be said where they were slaughtered, when they were slaughtered, whether it was on site - but horsemeat passed through Peter Boddy's slaughterhouse without being properly documented.\\" He added that although the prosecution could not say whether the meat had ended up in the human food chain, \\"there would be no cause to cover up the provenance or destination of horsemeat unless there was something underlying wrong with that horsemeat\\". Christopher James, defending Boddy, said his client had been \\"reckless\\", but that his failings were not deliberate and the meat had only ever been offered as horsemeat.

Cut your wire pieces at 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) and bundle them together neatly. Wrap the bundle with floral tape about 2 in (5.1 cm) from the top of the wire. With hydrangeas, you shouldn’t separate the petals too much, but try to separate the petals a bit and move the ends around after the glue has dried. This will make the flower appear fuller and more natural. Summary:","completion":"Create classic, full hydrangea flowers by choosing light-colored tissue paper, bundling wire pieces, and separating petals slightly after gluing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What does Mary say to explain why she lied about cleaning up the basement. Movie plot title: Psycho II Movie plot: Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after being pronounced of sound mind by his psychiatrist, Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia) after 22 years. At the hearing preceding Norman's release, Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) shows up to protest, producing a petition that she's been circulating with signatures of 743 people who do not want to see Norman return to society. Lila is the sister of Marion Crane, one of Norman's victims (from the first film), and the widow of Sam Loomis, who was Marion's boyfriend at the time of her death. When the judge refuses to acknowledge Lila's petition, she vows to see Norman returned to the institution to pay for his crimes.Dr. Raymond takes Norman back to his old home, the gloomy mansion on the hill behind the Bates Motel. A car is parked by the motel, which belongs to Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz)--the current owner of the motel. Dr. Raymond offers to introduce Norman to him, but Norman says it can wait until later. Walking up the steps to the house, Norman thinks he sees someone in his mother's bedroom window. Dr. Raymond says there hasn't been a tenant in the house for years. Norman admits he is just nervous about being back after such a long time away.Inside the house, all the furniture is covered up with sheets. Dr. Raymond asks Norman if he wants to stay somewhere else, but Norman insists on being back at home. Dr. Raymond reminds Norman that, with him living back at home, the memories from his past are likely to reoccur, but he is confident that Norman can handle it now. Dr. Raymond regrets that there won't be a trained social worker to check in on Norman occasionally, due to budget cutbacks, however Norman says that at least Dr. Raymond will come by from time to time to see him. Dr. Raymond informs Norman that the telephone has been reconnected, and that he is to report to work at noon for a pre-arranged job as a short-order cook and dishwasher at a diner down the road from the motel.After Dr. Raymond leaves, Norman takes his suitcase upstairs, and...

By understanding how E-mail works, and by taking some steps in how you deal with reading and writing messages, you can keep this threat out of your computer. When you exchange E-mail with someone else, the messages sent between you and that person pass through several computer before they reach their places. Imagine this conversation as it is taking place in an Internet \\"room\\", a very, very big room. Anyone, or more exactly, any program can probably understand what is being said, because most Internet conversations are not hidden in any way.

E-mail-borne viruses often arrive in attractive, fantastic appearances, much like the beautiful ads we receive by way of traditional mail that is made to sell us something. By beautiful appearances, an infected E-mail message seems to be something we want to read from someone we know, not a mean virus ready to destroy or damage our computers. There are some steps that you can take to help you decide what to do with every E-mail message with an attachment that you receive. You should only read a message that passes all of these tests: 1) The Know Test: Is the E-mail from someone that you know? 2) The Received Test: Have you received E-mail from this sender before? 3) The Expect Test: Were you waiting for E-mail with an attachment from this sender? 4) The Meaning Test: Do the topic line of the E-mail message and the name of the attachment both have meanings? 5) The Virus Test: Is the E-mail infected?

The paragraph provides data on organ donations in New Zealand for the years 2005 and 2006, and an average number for the years before 2005. While it is clear that there has been a decrease in organ donations, there is not enough data to extrapolate a definitive trend for the subsequent years, including the next year. In order to predict the number of organs donated for the next year with accuracy, we would need more comprehensive information about the factors affecting the organ donation rates, such as public awareness campaigns, changes in legislation, and healthcare system conditions. Moreover, the data provided in the paragraph only states the historical facts, and organ donation rates can be subject to change due to several factors. For instance, new regulatory measures or campaigns promoting organ donation may be introduced, which can potentially lead to an increase in the number of organs donated. Predicting the number of organs donated for a specific year without any supporting evidence or a clear trend established on a larger dataset would be speculative.

Ben and Mike both studied earthquakes, while Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena. Which person learned about lowering the melting temperature of the mantle? Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.","completion":"Since Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena, he would be the person who learned about lowering the melting temperature of the mantle. This is because the process of mantle melting is closely related to the three ways mentioned in the hint: (1) temperature rise, (2) pressure lowering, and (3) addition of water. Mantle melting plays a key role in the formation of volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries.

But Ruth Madoff seems likely to end up with a relative pittance even if she is found not to have any connection to her husband's decades-long Ponzi scheme. On Monday federal prosecutors notified a New York court that they will also seek the assets of Ruth Madoff, including a 7.0 million Manhattan penthouse, homes in Palm Beach, France and New York's Long Island, a 2007 BMW as well as three other vehicles and 62.0 million in funds deposited in her name. Last week, 70-year-old Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty to securities fraud and perjury, among other charges in a scheme that seems to have cost investors a mind-boggling 65.0 billion. He took the unusual course of pleading guilty as charged without trying to strike a deal with prosecutors. Madoff might have sought some degree of leniency in exchange for naming his accomplices. He claimed he ran the whole fraud by himself and, having admitted his guilt, could not benefit from helping prosecutors gain an exact understanding of how his scheme worked. In a court filing in March, Madoff's lawyers had indicated that Ruth Madoff was entitled to keep as much as 69.0 million in assets that were unrelated to the fraud. In the end, the government will get most of the assets, and Ruth Madoff will be left with a small amount to pay for her living expenses, said Michael Goldberg, a shareholder at Akerman Senterfitt who specializes in unraveling Ponzi schemes. She was not independently wealthy or making money on her own, so any assets she has would be directly traceable to the fraud. Theres virtually no chance that she will be able to keep any significant assets. Madoff could face up to 150 years in prison when he is sentenced in June. On Thursday at least 50 victims sat in a packed U.S. District Courtroom in Manhattan as the disgraced money manager was led off to jail in handcuffs after pleading guilty to masterminding the 65.0 billion Ponzi scheme. (See Bernie Madoffs Billionaire Victims.) In court papers on Friday, lawyers for Bernard Madoff argued that he should be released while he awaits sentencing. The papers detailed the assets and put the net worth of Madoff and his wife at 823.0 million to 826.0 million. Last month, a court-appointed trustee said he had recovered about 946.4 million for former Madoff clients. Thomson Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this article.

It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here. Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him. That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out' a visitor said. So people put five wolves into the jaguar's zoo. Since then, the jaguar did not go back to its cave any more . It either stands on top of the hill yelling or runs up and down the hill without sleeping all day long .

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides? , can you please find it? There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...

You see, little one, the scouts in Scoutland always looked forward to this event, because it meant they could show off their amazing skills, and win lots of shiny medals. These scouts really loved to play hard and have a good time. Now, the scouts knew that this particular series was going to be really tough, because all the other teams were practicing super hard too.

They knew it was going to be a tough series, but they were ready for the challenge. The scouts were certain that if they worked together and played their best, they could win.

Even so, he made no gains in Clinton's delegate lead, as each earned seven delegates as a result. The Vermont senator was favored going into the caucuses. Wyoming is similar to other places he's won with big margins: rural, Western and overwhelmingly white. The victory is Sanders' eighth win out of the last nine contests -- including a contest that counted the votes of Democrats living abroad -- and a big morale booster heading into the crucial New York primary on April 19. Sanders, speaking at a rally in Queens, New York, when the state's results were projected, announced the victory to his supporters after his wife, Jane, joined him on stage to say they had won. \\"News bulletin: We just won Wyoming,\\" Sanders said as the room exploded into cheers. Sanders won 55.7% of the vote to Clinton's 44.3%, giving each candidate seven delegates. That helps Clinton maintain her pledged delegate lead over Sanders, 1,304 to 1,075. A Clinton campaign aide said their \\"secret sauce\\" in Wyoming was the state's onerous vote-by-mail rules that required anyone voting by mail to have voted as a Democrat in the 2014 midterms. \\"This is exactly the type of contest he needed to shut us out in,\\" the aide said. \\"Not only did he not do that, he only netted two delegates, if that.\\" With 55% of remaining delegates in New York, Pennsylvania and California, one senior aide said \\"by the time we get to California, we will only need to meet threshold to win. He can win 85% and we're fine.\\" Sanders is banking on momentum to keep Clinton from officially clinching the nomination until the convention, when superdelegates will vote. \\"If you look at the math, if you want to talk about math, the truth is is that it is very, very, very unlikely that either candidate, either Secretary Clinton or Sen. Sanders, will go into the convention with a majority needed of pledged delegates in order to win,\\" Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \\"New Day\\" Tuesday. The Republican National Committee in a statement Saturday afternoon quickly noted Clinton's \\"embarrassing string of defeats,\\" a sign, the RNC said, that Clinton will be beatable if she's the Democratic nominee. Democrats turn out Leaving nothing to chance, Sanders spent Tuesday night -- the evening he won Wisconsin's primary -- holding one of his signature large rallies in Laramie, a town of 30,000. It could be all the attention Wyoming gets in the presidential contest. The rural, sparsely-populated state that's home to former Vice President Dick Cheney is solidly Republican , so Democrats don't spend time trying to win it in the general election. Saturday morning, Wyoming Democrats jammed into Cheyenne Central High School to caucus. \\"We're expecting a record turnout throughout the state. There's a lot of excitement,\\" said Aimee Van Cleave, executive director of the state Democratic Party. \\"It's wonderful today. Everyone will be allowed to vote. They're not being stopped by an early spring blizzard.\\" One group of enthusiastic Sanders partisans broke into a Bernie Sanders song to the tune of \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\\" \\"Elections in America are brought by corporations / Bernie is the only one who uses small donations,\\" they sang, to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. Republicans, meanwhile, are in neighboring Colorado for a party convention where every delegate matters on the road to Cleveland's GOP convention and Donald Trump is trying to clinch the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination.

The Democratic race has taken a sharply bitter turn in New York, where Sanders accused Clinton of \\"hustling money from the wealthy and powerful\\" on Thursday, and Clinton instructing Sanders: \\"Don't make promises you can't keep.\\" Sanders raised the stakes on Wednesday night, launching into a tirade on why Clinton is \\"not qualified\\" for the presidency by citing her positions on trade and her coziness with Wall Street interests. \\"I'm not going to get beaten up. I'm not going to get lied about. We will fight back, but I do hope that we can raise the level and I do hope that the media will talk about real issues,\\" he said Thursday in Philadelphia.

Barack Obama in 2008 after a hard-fought Democratic nominating contest. Still, Clinton said she's going to \\"keep drawing contrasts\\" with Sanders. \\"Because that's what elections are about,\\" she said. \\"But I think it is important to tell people about what you're going to do for them, and how you can get it done -- how you can produce results that will make a positive difference in people's lives.\\" |||||","completion":"Bernie Sanders has won the Wyoming Democratic caucuses, continuing his recent string of victories and providing his campaign with additional momentum before the crucial New York primary on 19 April.

No one in the family seems to know when she started collecting them, or exactly how many she had. My grandmother died just over two years ago. At 91, she had spent 30 years without her right leg, which was removed due to cancer the year I was born. She was a poet, an artist, a food lover and a salt cellar collector. The funny thing about the salts, as she called them -- I never once heard her say salt cellar -- was that although everybody knew they were her hobby and everyone was always searching for them at yard sales or in stores, nobody seemed to know what they meant to her and they just wanted to make her happy. Grandma kept her salts in a dark wooden corner display case in the living room. Since her death the case has remained exactly as she left it. Grandpa tries his best to preserve his memories of her just as they are. Now I am collecting, too. Collecting memories about my grandmother's hobby, a way she spent her time. And as I hold one of them in my hand, I picture her holding it in her hand on the day she got it. She is smiling. My mother and her two sisters all have small collections, but my mother admits that she was more interested in finding salts to send to Grandma. Grandma once wrote a poem titled \\"When April Comes\\". The poem contains the line, \\"When April comes and I am not around, remember me when daffodils are found.\\" Now, Grandpa is working on a poem with the line, \\"April came and you were not around\\". But she was, somehow. She was there in the memories left behind by her possessions. Answer:","completion":"What was a significant aspect of the grandmother's life mentioned in the article? A.

As their movements become slower and slower, the attractive forces between become stronger. When we are increasing energy used while running what will happen speed up or slow down? Answer:","completion":"When the liquid particles lose energy, their movement slows down even more, reflecting a decrease in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a particle is directly related to its speed – as the kinetic energy decreases, the overall speed of the particle decreases as well. The attractive forces between particles play a significant role in the changes occurring within a liquid, as stronger attractive forces lead to greater potential energy. In simpler terms, as particles lose energy and slow down, they are held more tightly by the attractive forces between them. Now, considering the situation when we increase energy used while running, this can be explored by examining the laws of motion and energy conservation. An increase in energy usage when running signifies a greater input of work being done on a body or an object. Work is a transfer of energy, and as per the work-energy theorem, the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. So, when we exert more energy while running, it leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of our body. Since kinetic energy is directly related to the speed or velocity of an object, the effect of increasing energy will lead to an increase in the speed. As we utilize more energy when running, it translates into a faster movement or pace. This accelerated speed comes from the enhanced force applied to overcome air resistance, gravitational forces, and any other factors that act against the motion. In conclusion, if a person uses more energy when running, their speed will increase as a result. This increase comes from the increased kinetic energy of their body, as the energy expenditure causes a faster pace and quicker motion. Similarly, in the case of liquid particles, when they lose energy, their motion slows down, and the attractive forces between them become stronger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Vincent Price and Gavin Gordon in The BatCornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) is a mystery author who lives in a town terrorized by a mysterious murderer known only as \\"The Bat\\". The Bat is said to be a man with no face who murders women at night by ripping out their throats with steel claws. Early in the film, The Bat enters Van Gorder's house and releases a bat, which bites van Gorder's maid Lizzy (Lenita Lane). With Lizzy in a panic, fearing she may now have contracted \\"the rabies\\", an outbreak of which local papers have reported, Van Gorder calls her doctor, Dr Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price), who is conducting research on bats.Meanwhile, the whole town is searching for a million-dollar stash of looted bank securities that were recently stolen. Dr. Wells discovers the location of the treasure when the thief confides in him. Wells then murders the thief in cold blood, presumably so that he can take the treasure for himself, which he believes to be hidden in van Gorder's house.A series of break-ins and murders by The Bat brings the local chief of detectives, Andy Anderson (Gavin Gordon) to the Van Gorder house.

Please answer the following question: This article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death?, what is it ?

However, Prot's unwavering ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself, K-PAX, and its civilization leads Dr. Powell to introduce him to a group of astrophysicists, where Prot claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of \\"light-travel\\" and goes on to display rare knowledge that resolves a puzzle for them.After Prot explains that his people do not live in families, Dr. Powell invites Prot to his home for a July fourth picnic. Prot translates for the dog, eats, learns about Dr. Powell's family problems, and plays with the children until the sprinkler turns on and he freaks out.Prot exhibits considerable influence over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. Prot has explained that he can take one person with him when he returns; thereafter most of the patients at the institute ask to be taken to K-PAX.Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Dr. Powell confronts Prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in Prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma.

Webb, who took charge of the 2010 World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands, awarded a controversial first minute penalty against Liverpool in their 1-0 FA Cup third round defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. Webb also sent off Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard for a first half challenge on Michael Carrick, again hotly disputed. Dutch international Babel used his Twitter blog to post a mocked-up picture of Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt. Dalglish makes losing start as Liverpool go out. Babel also wrote: \\"And they call him one of the best referees?

OPTIONS: [+] yes; [+] no;","completion":"Yes, the statement you provided is correct. The Holocaust happened during World War II, taking place from 1941 to 1945. It was orchestrated by the Nazis, led by Adolf Hitler, with the goal of exterminating certain groups of people, mainly Jews, but also including Roma (Gypsies), Poles, Slavs, Soviet prisoners of war, disabled individuals, and LGBTQ+ populations, among others. The Holocaust was among the most devastating and darkest events in human history, resulting in the systematic persecution, and ultimately the deaths, of approximately six million Jews, as well as millions of others from different groups. The event was carried out through various stages and methods. At first, people deemed \\"undesirable\\" by the Nazis were disenfranchised, losing their rights and being subjected to pervasive discrimination. During the war, these individuals were forced to live in ghettos, isolated areas surrounded by walls or fences, where they were deprived of their basic needs. The Holocaust worsened when Nazi Germany decided to intensify its efforts and escalate its genocidal activities known as \\"the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\\" This plan, led by Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, involved the construction and operation of extermination camps where millions were systematically murdered, mostly in gas chambers. These camps, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Chelmno, and Majdanek, were established in Germany-occupied Poland and other regions, resulting in the rapid increase of Jewish and other targeted victims. Apart from the extermination camps, millions were executed through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation, and other forms of mistreatment in concentration camps and ghettos. Throughout the Holocaust, diverse resistance movements emerged, with people fighting back through armed struggle, spiritual resistance, or rescuing targeted populations. The Holocaust came to an end in 1945 with the defeat of Nazi Germany. However, the lasting effects of this genocide continue to be felt by those who survived and the global community as a whole. The Holocaust serves as a critical reminder of the importance of promoting tolerance, understanding, and respect for the inherent dignity and rights of all human beings. Additionally, it highlights the ongoing responsibility to ensure that such atrocities are never repeated."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener didn't increase predator population? Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

Possible A: injury, being laughed at, breaking the glass, contact with, lacerations Why is \\"lacerations\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Lacerations\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because when a person falls onto a pile of broken glass, their most immediate and rational concern would be about the potential physical harm that the sharp and jagged edges of the glass can cause. Lacerations refer to deep cuts or tears in the skin or flesh, which are highly likely to occur in such a situation. From the given options, \\"injury\\" and \\"contact with\\" are also reasonable answers, as they too relate to the potential harm or danger that can result when someone falls onto broken glass. However, \\"being laughed at\\" and \\"breaking the glass\\" are less aligned with human common sense as they focus on secondary concerns rather than the immediate risk of injury.

If you're buying packaged weisswurst, read the cooking instructions to determine if you should fully cook the sausages. Since many packaged weisswurst are precooked, you can simply toss them onto a medium-heat grill. Cover the grill and cook the weisswurst until they're completely hot throughout. Turn the weisswurst occasionally and grill them for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the hot weisswurst. Avoid poking the weisswurst casing with a fork, knife or tongs to prevent the flavorful liquid inside the sausage from leaking. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for medium-heat. Brush the grill grate with vegetable oil, so the sausages don't stick to the grill. Place the weisswurst on the grill over indirect heat. Cover the grill and let the weisswurst cook until they reach 140 °F (60 °C). Frequently turn the sausages and spray them with a little water or beer, so they brown evenly and don't split. Remove the cooked weisswurst from the grill and transfer them to a serving plate. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the sausages and let them rest for 5 minutes. They'll finish cooking and then you can serve the hot weisswurst. You can store leftover grilled weisswurst in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\" have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals\\" is \\"humans\\", given that frogs have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals? Answer:","completion":"The right answer to the question \\"have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals\\" is not limited to just humans or frogs, as a considerable number of living organisms possess sense organs that allow them to detect, smell, and taste chemicals in their environments. In fact, it is a common biological adaptation across numerous species. In the case of humans, the sense of smell (olfaction) is facilitated by the olfactory system, which includes the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. The sense of taste (gustation) in humans, on the other hand, is facilitated by the taste buds on the tongue, which contain receptor cells that respond to specific chemicals in food and beverages. Frogs also possess similar sense organs that allow them to detect chemicals in their environment. They have nasal cavities and specialized taste organs called \\"taste buds\\" on their tongues and other parts of the mouth. These taste-receptor cells help frogs identify food and avoid harmful or toxic substances. Thus, both humans and frogs, along with numerous other animal species, have sense organs that respond to chemicals.

Fact 2: An electrical current is a flow of electrons. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"when a circuit is working properly, what runs through that circuit?\\" with the following options: - coils - direct energy - electromagnetic energy - conductors - h2o - activation energy - hydrogen and oxygen - flow of electrons A:","completion":"When a circuit is working properly, a \\"flow of electrons\\" runs through that circuit. This statement can be explained with reference to the provided facts. Fact 1 states that \\"when an electrical circuit is working properly, electrical current runs through that circuit\\". According to conventional understanding, an electrical current is constituted by the flow of electric charge, which is essentially disseminated by moving electrons within the circuit. Fact 2 further corroborates this by explicitly defining an electrical current as a \\"flow of electrons\\". Hence, this understanding aligns with the conventional comprehension of how electrical circuits operate. In an electrical circuit, the element that moves is essentially the electric charge within the objects, and not the other components. This movement is feasible due to the presence of free moving electrons -- particularly in conductive materials -- that shift from one location to another under the influence of an electric field, facilitating the flow of electrical current. To further detail, an electrical circuit is a closed path or a loop within which an electric current flows. This circuit comprises components such as conductors (which facilitates the 'flow of electrons'), loads (like a light bulb or a motor which utilize the energy carried by the electrons), and a power source (like a battery or a generator which produces the electrical energy). So when we say the circuit is working properly, it implies that the electrical energy is being efficiently transformed into other forms of energy like light, heat, motion etc. according to the needs of the device in use. In comparison to the other options – \\"coils\\", \\"direct energy\\", \\"electromagnetic energy\\", \\"conductors\\", \\"H2O\\", \\"activation energy\\", and \\"hydrogen and oxygen\\" – the accurate statement is the \\"flow of electrons\\". It's because as per the provided facts, coils, conductors, hydrogen and oxygen, or H2O are not 'what runs through the circuit', but rather they are components or factors that could influence how the 'flow of electrons', is achieved or controlled in the circuit. On the other hand, direct energy, activation energy, or electromagnetic energy are forms which the electrical energy (carried by the 'flow of electrons') may be converted to, depending upon the kind of load or device the circuit is catering to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent.

Alexander McCracken, 35, shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies with his then-girlfriend Sharon Campbell and said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl'. Police found more than 500 hardcore child porn and bestiality images when they raided his home in Ayr, many of which were passed on to other paedophiles. The pair are now facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court. Former police officer Alexander McCracken, 35, (pictured) shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl' McCracken, who has a 10-year-old son, spent nine years with Strathclyde Police before being exposed in 2010 as a swinger and a £400-a-night bisexual prostitute, the Daily Record reported. Police seized his computer and smartphone in last year's raid and found a string of sickening messages including one which suggests they breed a 'baby toy' and abuse it 'as soon as born'. One, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.' When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol. I would help him lol.' The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by McCracken.

The pair are facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court (pictured) 'The communications include content of a paedophilic nature, comments on the rape and killing of newborn babies and what purports to be a couple trying for a baby so that they can sexually abuse her.' He revealed that cybercrime experts found 551 such images in Yahoo Messenger chat files after the raid in January last year. The majority of the images were category five, the most depraved possible and most were passed among paedophiles between July 2012 and October 2013. Mr Bradford said: 'The images are predominantly of young girls, with the majority being newborn, babies and toddlers with a few up to about the age of eight.' Police were alerted to the couple's actions by the National Online Child Abuse Protection service. Campbell, 39, who was a support worker for elderly people with mental health problems at a care home in Ayr, is no longer with McCracken. Her lawyer, Peter Lockhart, said: 'This is a frankly shocking and appalling offence and she recognises that. She has co-operated fully throughout and there is no getting away from it that a custodial sentence must be uppermost in your mind.' McCracken's lawyer Jill Malloy said he complied fully with strict bail conditions and had no unsupervised contact with females under 16 and no internet use where history could be hidden. She added that he had lost his job as a factory production worker. Sheriff Scott Pattison called for reports before sentencing next month. He said: 'These offences are of the utmost seriousness.

Andrew Mitchell launched an astonishing attack on the Metropolitan Police over the Plebgate affair last night – after a 12-month inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that a Number 10 police officer had lied. The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland – with whom he clashed in Downing Street – branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ‘plebs’ on oath. Mr Mitchell flatly denies claims by the officer that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street’s gates last September. Andrew Mitchell (pictured with his wife Dr Sharon Bennett) has said he ntends to bring PC Rowland to 'justice' and re-instate his reputation. His denunciation came as prosecutors yesterday decided a single officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, which involved taking more than 1,100 statements. PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office over allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row. Five officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, meaning they could lose their jobs. Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings. related]. But, crucially, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry. Mr Mitchell claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers of wrongdoing. Mr Mitchell said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth. 'I will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account. ‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry.’ The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland - with whom he clashed in Downing Street - branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word 'plebs' on oath. In a statement, PC Rowland said last night: ‘I stand by my account of events in Downing Street on 19th September 2012. 'This has now been thoroughly investigated and the CPS has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me. ‘In addition, neither am I subject to any disciplinary proceedings. 'I confirm that I am prepared to give evidence under oath if required.’ Mr Mitchell is suing The Sun newspaper, which printed the original report, for libel and said he believed the paper would have to call PC Rowland to corroborate the paper’s account, forcing him to give evidence on oath. Scotland Yard said PC Rowland was interviewed under ‘police misconduct regulations’ – not under police caution. But it added his statement could have been used against him had he been charged with criminal or internal disciplinary offences. The announcement by new Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders fell far short of the result that Mr Mitchell had sought if he is to resume his cabinet career. She said: ‘We have considered all of the evidence in this case, including previously unseen, unedited CCTV footage from Downing Street, not referred to by the media. 'Taking it all into account, including the accounts of the officer at the gate of Downing Street and that of Andrew Mitchell MP before, during and after the incident, we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account. ‘The CPS has also found that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Mitchell was the victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’ Her lawyers also found that a jury would be likely to decide that the leaking of an email in the affair was in the public interest, a finding that could undermine Mr Mitchell’s attempt to sue the Sun. Sir Bernard said: ‘This investigation has been a ruthless search for the truth as at the heart of this are extremely damaging allegations that officers have lied and falsified statements against a Cabinet Minister.’ A Channel 4 documentary into the Plebgate affair has been called into question by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Last December’s programme – hailed by Andrew Mitchell and his supporters – appeared to cast doubt on the officers’ account of what happened. It revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate of Downing Street at the time of the altercation as had originally been claimed. Mr Mitchell at the gate where he clashed with the officer. He flatly denies claims that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street's gates last September. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who succeeded Keir Starmer QC earlier this month, said the programme ‘showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards’. She said in her 1,800-word statement on Plebgate: ‘Much of the press reporting to date has assumed that the CCTV recordings show that the gate officer lied about the words used during the incident. ‘The CCTV footage that has been aired publicly was edited and did not show the full picture. ‘We have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras. The CCTV footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or Mr Mitchell. ‘It is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by Mr Mitchell, and this has been confirmed by an expert.’ A Channel 4 spokesman defended its journalism on Plebgate. He said: ‘The CCTV footage was obtained by Andrew Mitchell from Downing Street and provided to Dispatches and Channel 4 News. The footage as broadcast for the first time on 18th December 2012 was not edited by the production team to change or alter the sequence of events. ‘Furthermore the three camera angles that we were provided with were image-matched frame by frame to confirm their veracity. We stand fully behind this investigation.’ At his televised press conference yesterday, Mr Mitchell made clear his appreciation of the Channel 4 documentary, and selected Michael Crick, Channel 4 News’s political correspondent – with whom he enjoys a strong professional relationship – to ask him the first question from the floor.

Andrew Mitchell, the former Tory chief whip, launched an attack on the Metropolitan Police over their handling of the Plebgate affair, saying there was insufficient evidence that a Number 10 police officer lied about the incident. 2. PC Toby Rowland was named by Mitchell as the officer he claims lied about his use of the word ‘plebs’. Mitchell insists he did not use the word and is asking that Rowland repeat his claims under oath. 3. PC Keith Wallis was charged with misconduct for allegedly falsely claiming he witnessed the argument. Wallis and four other officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group will face gross misconduct hearings. 4. The Crown Prosecution Service found there was not enough evidence to show that PC Rowland lied, nor is Rowland facing any misconduct proceedings. 5. Mitchell is suing The Sun newspaper, which initially reported the story, for libel. 6. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, announced that after reviewing all evidence, including unedited CCTV footage, there was insufficient evidence to prove that the officer at the gate lied, or that Mitchell was a victim of a misinformation conspiracy. 7. Mitchell and his supporters praised a Channel 4 documentary that questioned the officers' account of events, but the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service called the credibility of the documentary into question. To wrap it up, this article highlights Mitchell's struggle to clear his name, the legal and professional ramifications for the officers involved, and the broader issue of truth and reliability within both the police force and the media."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Cells are the most basic structural and functional units in biological systems, and they play a crucial role in various life processes, such as growth, development, reproduction, and adaptation. Understanding cells allow us to decipher the inner workings of living beings and gain insights into various aspects of biology, including evolution, genetics, and physiology. 2. \\"Smallest units\\": This phrase highlights the microscopic nature of cells and emphasizes their position as the most basic components of living organisms. By calling them the \\"smallest units,\\" the sentence conveys that cells are indivisible, and no further substructures exist when considering an organism's basic structure and function. This notion is essential as it sets the foundation for various cellular concepts, such as cell division and differentiation, which are critical for the growth and development of organisms. 3. \\"Organism\\": The term \\"organism\\" refers to an individual living being, including animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. Organisms consist of various organ systems, tissues, and cells that work together to maintain their survival, growth, and reproduction. By mentioning \\"organism\\" in this sentence, it establishes the connection between cellular biology and the broader study of life processes in more complex structures. Moreover, this word highlights the significance of cells as the essential components that make up every living thing, from single-celled microscopic organisms to complex multicellular organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Scroll down for video. Kirsty, pictured before her weight loss, says she has also gained weight easily. Kirsty pictured in her dream size eight wedding dress on her special day in May this year. Determined Kirsty bought the dress anyway - and amazingly managed to lose all the weight ahead of her big day. Kirsty, 25, said: 'When I saw the dress, I just knew that I had to have it. 'The fact that it was only available in a size 8 was just the incentive I needed to really transform my life and get back into shape. 'I wanted a wedding album that I could be proud of and I knew the only way I was going to be able to achieve my goal was to fit into that dress.' Kirsty, from Maesteg, Bridgend, said: 'I had always put on a weight quite easily and needed to be careful what I ate. A chronic snacker, on a bad day Kirsty would eat whole pack of Jaffa Cakes. Kirsty was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. 'I am the type of person who can easily put on 4lb over the course of a weekend if eating lots of fattening things and having ice cream for dessert. 'I noticed my weight creeping up and obviously that affected my general self-esteem. 'I put on a lot of weight after the birth of my eldest son. You are told when you are pregnant that you can eat for two, but that is a complete myth. 'You only need a few more calories in the very late stages of the pregnancy but otherwise you should just eat as you would normally. 'I put on a stone and a half throughout the pregnancy and I didn't lose it after my son was born.' She was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. Her doctor said the falls were because of her weight. Kirsty's final trigger which encouraged to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic. Switching to a healthier low-fat diet, cutting out the snacking and beginning to exercise saw the pounds fall off. The final trigger which encouraged her to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic. Kirsty said: 'I remember walking down the beach and being approached by a group of women who were all in great shape and looked amazing in their bikinis. 'I felt so self-conscious because I was so badly out of shape and could see they were looking at me. I knew I had to change.' Mother-of-two Kirsty had bought the dress last August and when she finally tied the knot in May this year - just nine months later - she was a shapely size 8 weighing just 9st 12lb. She had lost a staggering 76lb, or 5st 4lb, - more than half a stone a month - and got the body she had always wanted. Kirsty achieved this feat by completely changing her diet and exercising regularly. She had previously snacked throughout the day and was incapable of just having one of her favourite Jaffa Cakes - on a bad day, she could munch her way through a whole packet. Kirsty was able to fit into her dream dress just nine months after buying it four sizes too small. Her other downfall was bread - she would eat five or six slices alongside her evening meal. Kirsty switched to a healthier low-fat diet, cut out the snacking and started eating low-calorie bread. She also started taking Forza Supplements Raspberry K2 capsules which she says helped take the edge off her appetite at weak moments and gave her extra energy to exercise more. And if she ever needed an extra incentive to carry on with the diet, she just looked at the white dress in the cupboard and dreamed of the day she would be able to fit into it. Kirsty said she felt like a new woman as she got back into shape. She said: 'Once I put my mind to it, I found it quite straightforward. Kirsty says her wedding day was the 'happiest' of her life and that she loved looking at the pictures afterwards. 'The Forza Raspberry K2 capsules were a big help. I started walking a lot and they gave me real energy and helped me to get out more.' At the end of her weight loss journey Kirsty was finally at the right weight to fit into her wedding dress. 'It meant so much to me,' she said. 'The dress fitted me perfectly and looked just as wonderful when I had bought it as a size 16 all those months ago. 'My wedding day was the happiest of my life and I loved looking at the pictures afterwards. 'I had the wedding album I had always dreamed of.'

Primal Scream are a Scottish rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie (vocals) and Jim Beattie. The current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass) and Darrin Mooney (drums). Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \\"Throb\\" Young. The band performed throughout 1982-1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band were first introduced to the acid house scene by McGee in 1988. They were at first sceptical; Gillespie said: \\"I always remember being quite fascinated by it but not quite getting it.\\" The band quickly developed a taste for it and began attending raves. The band met up with DJ Andrew Weatherall at a rave, and he was given a copy of \\"I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have\\", a track from Primal Scream, to remix for one of his shows. Weatherall added a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell's \\"What I Am\\", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson's \\"Terraplane Blues\\" and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels. The resulting track, \\"Loaded\\", became the band's first major hit, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by another single, \\"Come Together\\", which reached number 19. The band entered the studio with Weatherall, Hugo Nicolson, The Orb and Jimmy Miller producing, and Martin Duffy now full-time on keyboards. They released two more singles, \\"Higher Than The Sun\\" and \\"Don't Fight It, Feel It\\" which featured the lead vocals of Manchester singer Denise Johnson, both of which were successful. The album, Screamadelica, was released in late 1991 to positive reviews. Ink Blot Magazine said that the album was \\"both of its time and timeless.\\" The album was also a commercial success, reaching number eight on the UK chart. The album won the first Mercury Music Prize, beating Gillespie's former band The Jesus and Mary Chain. The supporting tour kicked off in Amsterdam, and it included a performance at the Glastonbury festival before coming to an end in Sheffield. Throughout the tour the band and their increasingly large entourage gained notoriety for their large narcotic intake. Around this time, the band recorded the Dixie Narco EP. Some of the tracks had a more American blues rock sound than previously, and displayed a P-Funk influence.

Article: / Updated By Courtney Kube and Mary Emily O'Hara Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning walked out of a military prison early Wednesday after seven years behind bars. Manning's 35-year sentence for leaking an enormous trove of military intelligence records was commuted by President Barack Obama in January. At the time, the White House said Manning had accepted responsibility, expressed remorse and served time. A U.S Army official confirmed to NBC News that she was released from Fort Leavenworth military prison at around 3 a.m. ET. Manning made her first statement as a free woman on Wednesday, according to a statement sent out by the ACLU. \\"After another anxious four months of waiting, the day has finally arrived,\\" said Manning. \\"I am looking forward to so much! Whatever is ahead of me is far more important than the past. I’m figuring things out right now — which is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me.\\" She also uploaded the first photo taken of her in years, a snapshot of her shoes that she posted to a brand-new Instagram account. A few hours later, Manning's dreams of finally eating a slice of pizza came true. Pfc. Manning, 29, will remain an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army, but she won't be paid a salary and it's highly unlikely that she will be called to serve. However, her \\"excess leave\\" status will legally entitle her to military medical care, along with commissary privileges. The Crescent, Oklahoma, native tweeted after being granted clemency that she plans to move to Maryland. Neither she nor her attorneys explained why, but she has an aunt who lives there. Manning, a former intelligence analyst in Iraq, is still appealing her conviction in a case that could take years. The government has yet to respond to the appeal. \\"She is looking forward to eating pizza, swimming, playing PlayStation and meeting the many friends who have supported her over the years\\" Then known as Bradley Manning, she leaked nearly 750,000 military files and cables to WikiLeaks aged 22. The materials included battlefield video. Manning said she wanted to expose what she considered to be the U.S. military's disregard of the effects of war on civilians and that she released information that she didn't believe would harm the U.S. No document was classified higher than secret and her defenders say no one was endangered by the leaks. Critics said the leaks laid bare some of the nation's most-sensitive secrets and endangered information sources, prompting the State Department to help some of those people move to protect their safety. Several ambassadors were recalled, expelled or reassigned because of embarrassing disclosures. Manning was court-martialed and sentenced in 2013 to 35 years in prison. In a statement given to NBC's TODAY the day after sentencing, Manning came out as a transgender woman. Manning said in a statement released by her attorneys last week that she was looking forward to being released from Fort Leavenworth. People hold signs calling for Chelsea Manning's release during a gay pride parade in San Francisco on June 28, 2015. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters, file “For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,\\" she said. \\"I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world. Freedom used to be something that I dreamed of but never allowed myself to fully imagine.\\" Manning's ACLU attorney and transgender advocate, Chase Strangio, told NBC News that the current focus is on \\"building her life\\" once she steps out of prison. \\"She is looking forward to eating pizza, swimming, playing PlayStation and meeting the many friends who have supported her over the years but who were never allowed to visit in person,\\" Strangio said. \\"Beyond that, she is waiting to experience life outside of prison before declaring any future plans. After so many years of government control over her body and gender, I know she is eager to grow her hair, express her gender and negotiate decisions on her own terms.\\" Manning attempted suicide twice last year — once in July, another in November — while imprisoned in Kansas. She also began a hunger strike last September over what she says was the lack of treatment she was receiving for her gender dysphoria. The Department of Defense has repeatedly declined to discuss Manning's treatment in prison. Two fundraising projects are underway, with supporters raising money to fund Manning’s transition from prison back to civilian life. On GoFundMe.com, over 150,000 had been raised by Wednesday to pay for “rent, utilities, health care, clothing, and other living expenses for the first year.” Also on Wednesday, a group of musicians released a benefit album called Hugs For Chelsea. The compilation was created by transgender songwriter Evan Greer, and features high-profile artists from rock, indie, hip-hop, and punk genres. Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Graham Nash (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young), Talib Kweli, Against Me!, Mirah, Amanda Palmer, and others contributed songs to the 25 release, with REM’s Michael Stipe posting a short video on Twitter to encourage people to purchase it online. However, not everyone thinks Manning deserved to be freed. President Donald Trump, days before being inaugurated, wrote on Twitter that Manning is \\"TRAITOR ... who should never have been released from prison.\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said at the time that Obama's decision was \\"outrageous.\\" He added: \\"Chelsea Manning's treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets.\\" ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What next for Chelsea Manning after release? US soldier Chelsea Manning is celebrating her freedom after being released from military prison. Manning took to Twitter after her release, photographing her \\"first steps of freedom\\" in civilian clothes. In a brief statement, she said she was focused on the future, which \\"is far more important than the past\\". She served seven years of a 35-year sentence for leaking hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military files to Wikileaks. Most of her sentence was commuted by then-US President Barack Obama in January. In a statement issued through the American Civil Liberties Union, which provided her with legal support, Manning said: \\"After another anxious four months of waiting, the day has finally arrived. I am looking forward to so much!\\" She added: \\"Whatever is ahead of me is far more important than the past. I'm figuring things out right now - which is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me.\\" A US Army spokesperson confirmed that she left Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in the early morning. Image copyright Twitter Image caption Manning posted her message to a new Instagram account at the same time The 29-year-old soldier was born Bradley Manning. A day after she was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, Manning said she had felt female since childhood and wanted to live as a woman called Chelsea. \\"For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,\\" she said in a statement last week ahead of her release. \\"I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world.\\" Speaking to the BBC, Manning's friend, the journalist Glenn Greenwald - who was involved in the publication of leaks from Edward Snowden - said she faced a difficult life outside prison. \\"She's going to live in a country where the top officials have expressed extreme denunciations of her, condemnations of her, who regard her as a traitor,\\" he said. \\"But the reality is that if you look back at what it is that she achieved, she revealed unquestionable war crimes, her disclosures led to reforms around the world.\\" President Obama's decision to commute her sentence drew criticism from leading Republicans, including Senator John McCain, who called it a \\"a grave mistake\\". 'Back to Maryland' Manning was convicted of 20 charges in connection with the leaks, including espionage. She was acquitted of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy. She defended the leaking by saying she had wanted to spark a public debate in the US about the role of the military and US foreign policy, but later apologised for \\"hurting the US\\", saying she had mistakenly believed she could \\"change the world for the better\\". In January she tweeted that she wanted to move to Maryland after being released, a state where she previously lived. On Monday she tweeted: \\"Two more days until the freedom of civilian life ^_^ Now hunting for private #healthcare like millions of Americans =P\\". Manning will remain on active army duty while her military court conviction remains under appeal. She will have healthcare benefits but will be unpaid, the army says. An online campaign set up by her attorney has raised 150,000 (£115,725) to pay for her living expenses for the first year after her release. If the appeal is denied, she could be dishonourably discharged from the army, US media say.

Included in those files was video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007, and many sensitive messages between US diplomats. Manning twice attempted suicide last year at Fort Leavenworth, a male military prison. She also went on a hunger strike last year, which she ended after the military agreed to provide her with gender transition treatment. ||||| : This is the official campaign raising funds for Chelsea Manning.

Justin wants to learn how to flip a pancake so he asks Robert for an advice, because","completion":"Robert is well-known for his expertise in the culinary world, particularly when it comes to making and flipping pancakes. Justin approaches Robert, eager to learn from the best. Robert, ever the humble mentor, is more than happy to teach Justin the art of flipping a pancake. To start, Robert offers Justin an introduction to the essential tools and ingredients needed for the perfect pancake. They review the basics, discussing the required ingredients such as flour, milk, eggs, butter, and salt, as well as the importance of a non-stick pan and the correct mixing techniques to prevent lumps in the batter. Justin is a quick learner, so they soon progress to the practical aspect of making the pancake batter. Under Robert's guidance, Justin quickly masters the perfect pour, creating an even layer of batter in the pan, which is heated gently. Robert teaches him how to shake the pan gently so that the batter spreads out evenly, ensuring an even cook with no overly thick or thin areas. Robert tells Justin that the key to a successful pancake flip is all about timing and confidence. Once the edges of the pancake begin to turn golden brown and small bubbles start forming on the surface, Justin knows it's time to gear up for the flip. Using a spatula, Robert demonstrates how to gently lift the edges of the pancake just enough to loosen it from the pan. Now comes the exciting part – the flip itself. Robert explains that the trick is to give the pan a gentle yet swift flick of the wrist, propelling the pancake upward and allowing it to make a full 180-degree turn before landing back in the pan. Justin watches in awe as Robert makes it seem effortless, the pancake floating gracefully through the air before landing perfectly, golden side up, back in the pan. With excitement and determination, Justin attempts his first flip. He follows Robert's advice to the tee, but his nerves get the better of him, and his pancake lands slightly off-center, folding onto itself. Robert encourages Justin not to be disheartened and reminds him that practice makes perfect. Justin, not one to back down from a challenge, tries again. After a few more attempts, Justin finally manages to flip his pancake with confidence. It's not as graceful as Robert's, but the sense of accomplishment is evident on his face. With each subsequent flip, Justin gains even more confidence, and his technique begins to show the poise and precision of a true pancake flipper. Robert offers further advice on how to ensure the pancake is cooked through, suggesting that it's important to pay attention to the smell and the color of the pancake. Once the second side is golden brown and it gives off a warm, buttery aroma, it's time to remove the pancake from the pan and begin the process all over again. In no time, Justin and Robert have a stack of delicious, perfectly flipped pancakes, ready to be enjoyed with their favorite toppings. As they sit down to savor their homemade feast, Justin can't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for his newfound skill, knowing that it was Robert's patience and guidance that made it all possible. As they continue to chat and laugh, Robert shares more of his culinary secrets with Justin, discussing the various cuisines he's experienced and the dishes he's created over the years. Inspired by his newfound passion, Justin resolves to continue learning from Robert, embracing the art of cooking as a valuable life skill. In the weeks and months that follow, under Robert's mentorship, Justin ventures beyond pancakes and learns to prepare all sorts of dishes, each one more intricate and impressive than the last. The two develop a strong bond through their shared love for cooking, and Justin soon becomes an accomplished chef in his own right, thanks in no small part to Robert's unwavering support and expertise. At the end of this culinary journey, Justin's initial desire to learn how to flip a pancake has transformed into so much more, fostering a lifelong friendship and a passion for cooking that will forever influence his approach to creating and enjoying food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained. Question: suppose You take more antibiotics to cure your infection happens, how will it affect \\"Kidneys function more poorly\\". How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"When you take more antibiotics than prescribed or necessary to cure an infection, it can negatively impact your kidneys by causing them to function more poorly. Antibiotics are drugs designed to target and eliminate bacterial infections in the body, but they can also have harmful effects on other systems like the kidneys. Here's a detailed explanation of how this can happen and how it influences the second effect you mentioned, which is the regulation of blood composition: 1. Antibiotics filtering through the kidneys: When you consume antibiotics, they eventually get filtered through the kidneys as they work to remove waste products from the blood. Although antibiotics are metabolized and broken down in the liver, their metabolites and unmetabolized portions still need to pass through the kidneys to be excreted in urine. When you take a higher dosage than required, it means that your kidneys will need to filter out greater amounts of these drugs which can put additional stress on the kidneys, causing them to function more poorly. 2. Nephrotoxic effects: Some antibiotics are known to be nephrotoxic, meaning they can damage the kidneys while performing their intended functions. When you take more antibiotics than necessary, the risk of nephrotoxic effects increases. This can lead to acute kidney injury or more severe chronic kidney damage, ultimately affecting their ability to filter waste out of the blood efficiently. Regarding the second effect (regulation of blood composition) being influenced by the supposed perturbation (kidneys functioning more poorly due to higher antibiotic intake): Less Effectiveness in Blood Composition Regulation: As the kidneys' function declines due to the overuse of antibiotics, their ability to regulate blood composition may be compromised. Kidneys are responsible for maintaining an appropriate balance of water, electrolytes, and minerals in the bloodstream. If the kidneys are damaged or functioning poorly due to excessive antibiotic intake, their ability to maintain this crucial balance may diminish, resulting in less effective regulation of blood composition. In conclusion, taking more antibiotics than necessary to cure an infection can negatively affect your kidneys by causing them to function more poorly. This poor kidney function has a subsequent negative impact on the regulation of blood composition, making it less effective. It is essential to follow proper dosage recommendations and only take antibiotics when prescribed by a healthcare professional to avoid these potential harmful effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

George O'Hearn","completion":"Title: Unraveling O'Hearn Genre: Drama/Mystery Introduction: The film introduces David Kepesh, a respected college professor and accomplished writer, who leads a seemingly perfect life. David and his closest friend, George O'Hearn, meet regularly to catch up over coffee and discuss their latest literary ventures. George, a lovable and witty man, captures the interest and respect of anyone he encounters. David admires George's unique outlook on life, and the two have been inseparable since the day they met. Act I: The story takes a turn when a shocking discovery is made about George O'Hearn. A student obtaining a copy of George's latest novel, \\"The Garden of Betrayal,\\" is accidentally given access to files containing classified government information. The student, who is ironically one of David's brightest proteges, uncovers evidence that George O'Hearn works as a mole for a foreign espionage agency. David struggles to process the revelation, as this puts a strain on their friendship and challenges his principles. An internal battle ensues as David grapples with the choice to confront George with this newfound information or approach the authorities. Act II: David, conflicted by his loyalty to George but determined to know the truth, takes it upon himself to investigate the matter. He covertly begins digging into George's past. This endeavor leads David down a rabbit hole of the underground world of spies, lies, and government corruption. David learns about the enigmatic handler, referred to as \\"The Puppetmaster,\\" who has been guiding George's actions. As David delves deeper, he realizes that George is not the only mole in their circle and that every individual has their reasons for getting entangled in the web of espionage. Act III: Despite his love for George, David finally confronts his friend, accusing him of betraying their country and jeopardizing their friendship. George, now aware that his cover may soon be blown, reveals that he had been working on an operation designed to expose and dismantle an enemy plot. \\"The Garden of Betrayal,\\" George's novel, is a cover for his real mission: unraveling the corruption that has seeped into the highest levels of the national intelligence agency. George realizes David's integrity outweighs his loyalty, and he decides to entrust him with the secrets of \\"The Puppetmaster\\" and the extent of the infiltration. Act IV: As the film progresses, David must make another choice: stay passive and protect his friend or actively join him in fighting the sinister forces at play. Ultimately, David throws caution to the wind and decides to stand by George's side unconditionally. They team up to foil \\"The Puppetmaster\\" and prevent a devastating, large-scale attack orchestrated by the enemy agency. The movie culminates in an adrenaline-fueled sequence of events, with the pair faced with life and death stakes amidst the chaos of a city at risk. Conclusion: In the aftermath, David and George emerge as unsung heroes. The traitors within the intelligence agency are brought to justice, but David and George's actions remain concealed to protect their identities. Their friendship, tested by the harshest realities and hidden betrayals, emerges stronger than ever. The film concludes in a bittersweet manner; both friends are forced to live with the consequences of their choices but remain bonded through their shared experiences. The final scene of the movie portrays an ordinary day, reminiscent of the introduction. David and George sit together at their favorite café, smiling at each other as they share coffee and discuss their latest literary passion, hinting at the enduring power and resilience of true friendship. \\"Unraveling O'Hearn\\" delivers a powerful message about loyalty and friendship, presented in a gripping cinematic narrative that explores the dark and dangerous world of espionage and secrets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In many countries the standard of living enjoyed by their people has increased rapidly in recent years. Sadly, not everyone in these countries is so fortunate and many people in rich countries are homeless. The reasons for homelessness are various, but poverty is undoubtedly one of the main causes. The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars. Often they are moved on by the police, being accused ,whether rightly or wrongly, of forceful begging . There are many who disrespect homeless people. Some cynics declare that homeless people choose to live the life which they lead. But who would willingly choose to live in a shop doorway, under a bridge or in a cardboard box?

Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins. In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu. But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the \\"actress\\" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer. Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet. The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which are, by the way, not really convincing. Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Coyotes rarin' to go vs. Avalance after 5-day break The Arizona Coyotes return from a five-day layoff Thursday night to host an Avalanche team coming off one of its most impressive performances of the season. After producing 12 goals over a 1-5-1 stretch, Colorado (4-7-1) recorded three in the final seven minutes to earn a 6-3 home win over slumping Calgary on Tuesday. Nathan MacKinnon netted the game-winner with 6:59 remaining and added two assists, while Matt Duchene scored twice after managing just one goal through the first 11 games. The game can be seen on FOX Sports Arizona, starting at 6:30 p.m. Arizona (5-5-1) seeks a return to early-season form in its first outing since Friday's 4-3 loss to visiting Vancouver, its sixth in eight games following a 3-0-0 start. A portion of those struggles came during an East Coast trip in which the Coyotes played five times in eight days. \\"If today's practice is any indication we'll have great energy,\\" Head Coach Dave Tippett said Wednesday. \\"We've tried to balance the workload with preparation, and we've had some good practices, so hopefully that gets us out of the fatigue factor we were into and into a new stretch of the season where we can get back at it and play well.\\" The break enabled Martin Hanzal to get healthy after missing the previous two contests with a lower-body injury. The top-line center has 10 assists in nine games while often working with promising youngsters Max Domi and Anthony Duclair, each tied for the team lead with five goals. \\"It was good to get some time off after that heavy schedule we had, but now everbody's really excited to get back,\\" forward Tobias Rieder said. \\"We're ready to go.\\" Tippett is hoping the time off benefits Mike Smith as well. The struggling goaltender has a 4.55 goals-against average over his past seven starts after yielding two goals in winning his first three. Smith was pulled just 4:26 into the Vancouver game after allowing two goals on three shots, three days after permitting six in a loss at Boston. Smith owns a 1.93 GAA in 10 career starts against Colorado but has lost his last three while surrendering four goals in each. Center Antoine Vermette is questionable for the game due to a lower-body injury. The Avalanche's late-game outburst vs. Calgary reversed a season-long trend of third-period failures. \\"We knew how we felt when we collapsed,\\" MacKinnon said. \\"(Tuesday) it was different, more confidence. We just knew we were going to win this game. We thought we deserved it and we went and took it, so it definitely feels good.\\" Colorado has endured some goaltending issues of its own with Semyon Varlamov having allowed three or more goals in seven of his nine starts. With the Avs hosting the New York Rangers Friday, it's likely he'll split duties with Reto Berra during the back-to-back set. Varlamov posted a 1.80 GAA in winning his two matchups with the Coyotes last season. Colorado swept all three games with Arizona last season -- scoring 14 goals -- and has won six of the last seven meetings.","completion":"The Arizona Coyotes have had a five-day break and are now ready to play against the Avalanche team.

However, the process to obtain address proof might be similar in both cases. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting address proof in India (which also applies to Mumbai). Step 1: Determine your available documents First, find out which documents you have that can be used as address proof. In India, several documents are generally accepted as address proof, such as: 1. Aadhaar Card 2. Voter ID Card 3. Passport 4. Driving License 5. Ration Card 6. Bank statements or passbook 7. Post Office account statements or passbook 8. Utility bills (electricity, water, gas) issued within the last 3 months 9. Rent Agreement (registered) 10. Income Tax Assessment Order 11. Employer-issued and attested letter on company letterhead Step 2: Update your current address If you have any of the above documents, but they contain an outdated or incorrect address, take steps to update the address. The process to update your address on these documents may vary based on the issuing authority. For example, to update the address on your Aadhaar card, you can visit the UIDAI online portal or an Aadhaar Kendra (enrollment center). Step 3: Apply for a new document (if required) If you don't have any valid address proof documents, you can apply for one. For example, you can apply for a new Voter ID card or a new Aadhaar card with your current address. You'll need to provide other supporting documents such as identity proof and proof of residence. Step 4: Keep your address proof document safe Once you obtain or update your address proof document, make sure to keep it safe and easily accessible, as it might be required for various services and verifications. By following these steps, you can obtain address proof in India, including Mumbai."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Clothes can make phone calls, play music, dial your pal's number, keep you warm during cold weather and operate your computer? This is not a fantasy. A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a wide range of clothes -- clothes that have minds of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a kind of fabric that can be blended with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result are electronic garments. If you think the wearer has to be wired to different devices, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 percent shock proof, they say. The Electrotextiles team has also created the world's first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These 'lap- tap' gadgets are all set to take over laptop computers! Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably with others at the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim jacket with flexible earphones sewn into the hood and the electronic ski jacket with a built-in heater. The ski jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning system and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids.

Write an article based on this summary: About 630 children whose school was destroyed by floods during Storm Desmond have returned to lessons in temporary classrooms on the site of a former primary school.","completion":"Title: Storm Desmond's Young Victims Start Afresh in Temporary Classrooms Introduction The devastating effects of Storm Desmond in December 2015 left many communities wrecked, with countless lives impacted - including the lives of young children who were forced to leave their flood-damaged school. After a prolonged and difficult period, approximately 630 children can finally resume normalcy and return to lessons. This has been made possible by the provision of temporary classrooms, located on the site of a former primary school. The Impact of Storm Desmond Storm Desmond, a powerful extratropical cyclone, caused torrential rain and heavy flooding across the United Kingdom, especially in Northern England and Scotland. This unprecedented disaster brought life across these regions to a standstill, with schools and livelihoods adversely affected. The flood destroyed a vast number of homes and critical infrastructure, leaving thousands of people in despair. For the 630 children whose school was ruined by Storm Desmond's floods, education came to an abrupt halt. The school's impracticable condition imposed immense challenges on the pupils, their families, and the staff. Temporary Classrooms as a Solution Amid the chaos, local authorities and the community sprung into action to find an alternative solution for the impacted children to smoothly transition back to receiving their education. They identified the site of a former primary school that had been closed down as a potential location for temporary classrooms. With a concentrated effort from the government, NGOs, and the wider community, the site was equipped with the necessary infrastructure, including spacious classrooms, practical amenities, and safety measures. With the temporary classrooms securely set up on the former primary school's property, the stage was set for the children to resume their education journey without further disruption. A sense of hope and recovery filled the air as the 630 children from the storm-ravaged school eagerly made their way back to their new temporary campus. Adjusting to the New Educational Environment For the children, staff, and parents, the transition to the temporary classrooms represents a significant milestone on the road to recovery. The children can now focus on their education once again, while the staff can continue teaching with fewer obstacles hindering their progress. However, adjustments must be made to fit the new educational landscape. Teachers, parents, and students need to adapt to the temporary facilities and find creative ways of making the best use of the spaces and resources available. The children may also require additional emotional support to cope with the disruptions caused by the storm and the subsequent change in educational environments. Counsellors and dedicated staff will play a crucial role in helping the children return to a sense of normalcy in the aftermath of such a life-changing event. Looking Ahead to a Long-Term Solution Although the temporary classrooms symbolize an essential step toward recovery, the community's focus must now shift toward establishing a permanent solution for the affected school. This will entail extensive collaboration between local authorities, residents, and other stakeholders to ensure the construction of a new school, one equipped to withstand potential natural disasters in the future. In the meantime, the resilience of the 630 children, their families, and the staff must be commended. Their determination to overcome the challenges presented by Storm Desmond serves as a source of inspiration for all those affected by natural disasters around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from: -- no. -- yes.","completion":"To fix brassy orange hair at home, you can follow these steps: Step 1: Analyze the hair's current condition Before attempting any color correction, assess the hair's current state. Identify the dominant brassy orange tones and the overall health of the hair to determine the appropriate treatment method. Step 2: Choose a purple or blue-toned shampoo or toner Purchase a quality purple or blue-toned shampoo or toner. These products work by depositing violet or blue pigments into the hair to neutralize the unwanted brassy tones. The best purple shampoo for brassy hair depends on your preference, hair type, and budget. Some popular options include Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo, Fanola No Orange Shampoo, and Matrix Total Results Brass Off. Step 3: Apply the product Follow the instructions on the product label. Generally, you should apply the product to wet hair, lather, and let it sit for a few minutes to let the color-correcting pigments do their work. The amount of time the product should stay on your hair is specified by the manufacturer. Step 4: Rinse out the product Rinse the shampoo or toner out of the hair thoroughly. Be sure to use lukewarm or cool water to help seal the hair cuticle, locking in the color-correcting pigments. Step 5: Deep condition the hair Treat the hair with a deep conditioning mask to help repair any damage and moisturize the hair. This step will also make the hair more manageable and minimize frizz. Step 6: Evaluate the results After the hair dries, assess the results to determine if the brassy tones have been adequately neutralized. If necessary, repeat the process until the desired tone is achieved. Now, to answer your question about the meaning of the two questions: 1. How do you fix brassy orange hair at home? 2. What is the best purple shampoo with brassy hair? The answer is: no. These two questions are related but not the same. The first question asks for a method to fix brassy orange hair at home, while the second question specifically asks about the best purple shampoo for brassy hair. The answers to these questions can be interconnected, as using a purple shampoo is one way to fix brassy hair, but the questions themselves have different meanings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Groening was born on February 15, 1954 in Portland, Oregon, the middle of five children (older brother Mark and sister Patty were born in 1950 and 1952, while the younger sisters Lisa and Maggie in 1956 and 1958, respectively). His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (nee Wiggum; March 23, 1919 - April 22, 2013), was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919 - March 15, 1996), was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist. Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch-speaking family. After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with Simpsons writer/producer David X. Cohen (known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000. By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines; Groening claimed they had gone \\"overboard\\" in their discussions. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as \\"by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life.\\" The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groening's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, \\"Space Pilot 3000\\" (co-written with Cohen), \\"Rebirth\\" (story) and \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela\\" (story). After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to Family Guy, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films - Bender's Big Score (2007), The Beast with a Billion Backs (2008), Bender's Game (2008) and Into the Wild Green Yonder (2009) - would be produced. Since no new Futurama projects were in production, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the Futurama franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that \\"we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me\\". Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes, and began airing them in 2010. The show continued in to 2013, before Comedy Central announced in April 2013 that they would not be renewing it beyond its seventh season. The final episode aired on September 4, 2013. Did he do anything besides write?","completion":"Yes, Matt Groening has been involved in various aspects of the entertainment industry besides writing. 1. Cartoonist: Groening began his career as a cartoonist, with his comic strip \\"Life in Hell\\" being his first major success. The strip began in 1977 and continued until 2012. It featured anthropomorphic rabbits and a gay couple, Akbar and Jeff, and depicted the daily struggles and humor in life. This comic caught the attention of James L. Brooks, who approached Groening to create short animated features for The Tracey Ullman Show, which led to the creation of The Simpsons. 2. Animator: Groening played a significant role in creating and designing the characters for The Simpsons and Futurama. His distinctive drawing style is evident in the characters and the animation of both shows. 3. Voice Actor: Though not a regular voice actor, Groening has occasionally lent his voice to both The Simpsons and Futurama. He made cameo appearances as himself in a few episodes of The Simpsons and even voiced a character called \\"Old Man Waterfall\\" in the Futurama episode \\"A Taste of Freedom.\\" 4. Producer and Creative Consultant: For both The Simpsons and Futurama, Groening served as an executive producer and creative consultant. This involved overseeing the shows' development, working closely with the writers, animators, and voice actors, and ensuring the shows maintained their intended creative direction. 5. Music: Groening is a big fan of music and has curated several music festivals, including the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in the UK in 2003 and 2010. He has also released a limited edition vinyl album called \\"Drinky Crow's Clubhouse,\\" which features various artists and is a homage to Tony Millionaire's comic strip character \\"Drinky Crow.\\" 6. Comics Publishing: Groening founded his own publishing company, Bongo Comics Group, in 1993. The company specializes in producing comic books and graphic novels based on The Simpsons and Futurama, as well as original content by other writers and artists. In summary, Matt Groening's impact on the entertainment industry extends beyond writing, with significant contributions to animation, voice acting, producing, music, and comics publishing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Though there're many kinds of resources, with the fast increase of population and the increase of many more factories, the more we use, the fewer there will be left for the future. Oil is getting less and less year after year. It's said that oil can last for only 50 years. Natural gas perhaps will last about 38 years. Oil can be used in many ways and it's difficult to imagine what the modern world will be like without oil. But oil isn't easy to find and get out of the earth. Men must study the rocks. When they think the rocks in a certain place may have oil, a metal tower is built. A machine in the tower cuts a hole down into the ground. At the same time, a steel pipe is pushed down to stop the sides from falling in and to keep out water. At last if the men are right, usually the oil rushes up the sides with great force by the pressure of the gas in the top of the rock, and it rushes high into the air. If the oil catches a light, there will be a terrible fire. So a kind of cover is fixed on the top of the pipe, and the oil can run out through taps . If we are near the middle of the oil field, we can also get gas. Such gas is sent through pipes to towns far away and used in houses and factories like coal gas. Today oil is under pressure as never before. The price of oil keeps rising all the time. In many countries, the governments encourage people to save oil as much as possible. Options: A Coal gas can't be used in houses and factories. B Oil is very important in the modern world. C Many governments encourage people to waste oil as much as possible.

Write a text based on this summary: foreign exchange rates in new zealand Text:","completion":"Title: Understanding Foreign Exchange Rates in New Zealand Introduction Foreign exchange (Forex or FX) rates are an essential parameter determining the relative value of one currency against another. In New Zealand, the forex market is crucial for supporting trade and investments in the global economy, mainly due to its geographical location and its close ties with Australia and Asian markets. This article seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of the foreign exchange rates in New Zealand, the factors influencing them, and their impact on the economy. Overview of the Foreign Exchange Market in New Zealand The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) actively manages the country's monetary policy, which includes the exchange rate as one of the key determinants. As a small, open economy, New Zealand heavily relies on international trade, and its currency, the New Zealand Dollar (NZD), is one of the most traded currencies in the world. New Zealand’s major trading partners include Australia, the United States, China, and the European Union. As a result, trading in these currencies—Australian Dollar (AUD), United States Dollar (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY), and Euro (EUR)—is vital for New Zealand's forex market. Factors Influencing the Foreign Exchange Rates in New Zealand 1. Monetary Policy: The RBNZ aims to maintain price stability and promote long-term economic growth through controlling interest rates and the money supply in the economy. The set policy rates have a direct influence on the NZD exchange rate, as higher interest rates tend to attract foreign capital, strengthening the local currency. 2. Economic Indicators: Economic factors such as GDP growth rates, inflation, employment levels, and the trade balance can significantly impact the forex rates. A strong economy typically results in higher currency demand and, consequently, an appreciation of the NZD. 3. Market Sentiment: Global market sentiments and risk appetite can significantly impact the NZD's value. As a risk-sensitive currency, the NZD generally strengthens during upbeat market sentiment, fueled by investors' preference for riskier assets. 4. Geopolitical and Global Economic Events: Major global political and economic events—such as pandemics, natural disasters, or political crises—can quickly shift investors' perceptions and affect exchange rates. 5. Commodity Prices: New Zealand is a major exporter of commodities, particularly dairy products and agricultural goods. Fluctuations in global commodity prices can have a profound impact on the NZD's value, as higher prices usually boost its demand and vice versa. Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates on the New Zealand Economy Exchange rates have direct and indirect consequences on the New Zealand economy. Such effects include: 1. Trade and Competitiveness: Exchange rate fluctuations can impact the country's export competitiveness, as a weak NZD makes exports cheaper in foreign markets, boosting trade. Conversely, a strong NZD makes imports cheaper and may lead to increased demand for imported goods and services. 2. Inflation: Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have a direct bearing on inflation. A weak NZD can lead to higher import prices, leading to increased inflation rates, while a stronger NZD may cause lower import prices, reducing inflationary pressures. 3. Investment: Foreign exchange rates can encourage or discourage foreign direct investments (FDIs) into the country. An attractive exchange rate can boost foreign investments, contributing significantly to the country's economic development and growth. Conclusion Foreign exchange rates play a pivotal role in New Zealand's economy, primarily driven by its reliance on international trade and global economic integration. A multitude of factors, including monetary policy, economic indicators, global market sentiment, and commodity prices, influence these rates. In turn, fluctuations in exchange rates affect trade, inflation, and investments in the country, necessitating a clear understanding of their implications for businesses and individuals alike."},{"prompt":"Q: Generate a correct and concise answer for the question based on the words in the context.

Article:","completion":"Title: Longer Waits for Non-Urgent Patients at Cardiff Hospital This Weekend Hey kids, do you know what a hospital is? That's right, it's a place where sick people go to get better. And do you remember where Cardiff is? Yes, it's a big city in a country called Wales. Now, in this big city, there's a hospital that is saying something important to some patients. Let me tell you about it! The Cardiff Hospital has announced that this weekend, patients who don't have serious or urgent problems will have to wait longer than usual. What does that mean? Well, you know when you feel sick, and mommy or daddy take you to a place where the doctors and nurses make you feel better? Sometimes, you have to wait a little while before you see the doctor. This weekend, that waiting time might be a bit longer at the Cardiff Hospital. Why is this happening? Probably because there are many people who need to see the doctor or nurse right away because they are very sick or hurt. Sometimes, hospitals get very busy, so they need to make sure the people who need help the most are seen first. This way, they can help people get better faster. So, what can we do if we are one of those patients who have to wait for a longer time? We can be patient, and remember that there's a reason for the wait – it's because the doctors and nurses are very busy taking care of those who need help urgently. And, maybe, we can bring a book or a toy to play with while we wait our turn. In conclusion, kids, remember that hospitals are places where people go to get better when they are sick or hurt. This weekend, the Cardiff Hospital may be a bit more busy than usual, so if you go there, be patient and know that everyone is doing their best to help everyone feel better as soon as possible.

Choices: - dahlias and seed - Water and spore - ants and seed - seedless and seed A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"- seedless and seed Vascular plants are primarily divided into two types: seedless vascular plants and seed plants. Seedless vascular plants reproduce through spores, which are the plant's reproductive cells that grow without fertilization. Some common examples of seedless vascular plants include ferns, horsetails, and clubmosses. On the other hand, seed plants are vascular plants that produce seeds as a mode of reproduction. Seeds are essentially fertilized and matured ovules that contain a plant embryo, which can grow into a new individual plant upon germination. Seed plants are further subdivided into two categories: gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms are plants with \\"naked seeds,\\" such as conifers and cycads, where the seeds are not enclosed within an ovary or fruit. Angiosperms are plants that produce seeds within a protective structure called a fruit, such as flowering plants like roses, daisies, and apple trees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While this information is historically accurate, it does not directly address the question of what distinguished the Stamp Act from previous taxes. 3. Research to find the correct and complete answer: Upon further research, the Stamp Act was different from previous taxes because it was the first direct tax imposed by the British government on the American colonies.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Air was invigorating\\" correctly answer the question \\"What caused the kings of Spain to begin to visit Madrid\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph, the response \\"Air was invigorating\\" is part of the correct answer to the question \\"What caused the kings of Spain to begin to visit Madrid?\\" Another factor mentioned is that the hunting in the area was excellent.

Article: FOR people who are interested in space, nothing is more exciting than the idea of living on other planets. That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years.

Is The console's 2 kB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8 kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. a good answer to this question?","completion":"The provided statement focuses on the memory capacity and tile pattern information of the NES console, but does not directly answer the question about the standard display resolution of the NES. The answer should highlight the resolution and provide additional details to better address the question. A more comprehensive answer would be: The standard display resolution of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is 256x240 pixels. The NES is an 8-bit video game console, released in the 1980s, which utilized a custom Picture Processing Unit (PPU) for rendering graphics. The PPU is responsible for generating the video signal output displayed on a TV screen. The resolution of the NES comprises of 256 pixels horizontally and 240 pixels vertically, creating a grid where 8x8 pixel tiles are placed. The PPU has two pattern tables (also known as character tables), each having a 4 kB memory area for tile storage (8 kB in total). These pattern tables define the shapes and patterns used for both the background and the game sprites. While the NES does feature 2 kB of onboard RAM for tile maps and attributes, the 8 kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM mentioned in the provided statement is indeed stored on a cartridge. This storage provides the memory for tile patterns used in rendering game graphics, including both foreground sprites and the background. It is important to note that due to the limitations of the NTSC television standard at the time, the NES didn't utilize all 240 vertical pixels. In fact, only 224 pixels were typically visible, as the remaining lines were often used for off-screen objects and to simplify scrolling. Additionally, the PAL version of the NES utilized a slightly different resolution, with 256x288 pixels, to accommodate the PAL television standard. In summary, the standard display resolution of the NES is 256x240 pixels, with the console's onboard RAM being used for tile maps and attributes, and additional tile pattern ROM or RAM being stored on cartridges. The NES's PPU is responsible for rendering graphics using this memory and outputting the video signal to a TV screen."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Good Crazy is an episode from the comedy series on CBS named what?

The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 10 = 8*f - 6 for f, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable 'f' Start by isolating the term containing the variable 'f,' which is 8*f in this case. To do this, we will first perform the inverse operation of subtraction on both sides of the equation. Since the term on the right side of the equation is '-6', we will add 6 to both sides of the equation. 10 + 6 = 8*f - 6 + 6 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation We can now simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, 10 + 6 equals 16. 16 = 8*f On the right side, -6 + 6 equals 0, so the equation simplifies to: 16 = 8*f Step 3: Solve for 'f' Now that we have isolated the term containing 'f,' we can solve for 'f' by performing the inverse operation of multiplication, which is division. Since the term containing 'f' is '8*f', we will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to find the value of 'f.' 16 / 8 = 8*f / 8 Step 4: Simplify and find the value of 'f' On the left side of the equation, 16 divided by 8 equals 2. 2 = f On the right side of the equation, 8*f divided by 8 equals 'f', so the equation simplifies to: 2 = f So the solution to the equation 10 = 8*f - 6 is f = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Jets' seventh game was an interconference duel with the Packers. Punter Steve Weatherford made the game's most controversial decision in the first quarter, opting to attempt a fake punt and run for the first down on 4th and 18. Weatherford was stopped a yard short of the first down, giving the Packers ideal field position which eventually led to an early 3-0 Packers lead. \\"He does it on his own,\\" Ryan said. \\"(The Packers) were caving that side down. This was something Steve did on his own. I don't think he realized we'd just been sacked. We told him before that it needed to be a manageable situation, not fourth-and-20 or whatever it was.\\". In a game where defense ruled, the Packers lead 3-0 at halftime. The Jets challenged a Brad Smith fumble, and lost due to his knee not being down before losing the ball. However, the Jets second challenge went to a jump ball, called an interception after Packers cornerback Tramon Williams ripped the ball out of Jerricho Cotchery's hands while they were both on the ground. The play was controversially upheld, despite the fact that the receiver appeared to be down by contact. With no challenges left, Mark Sanchez threw a ball to Dustin Keller that was ripped out of his hands and ruled an interception in the 4th quarter. The replay showed that Keller made the catch and was also down before losing possession, but with no challenges left the Jets were left with nothing. Green Bay took a 6-0 lead after the turnover.

Background: Richard Lester Meyers (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name Richard Hell, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer. Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Context: Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor. Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism. Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books. Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Question: Was his mother in his life?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, after Richard Hell's father passed away when he was 7 years old, his mother raised him. She even returned to school and became a professor following her husband's death. Thus, his mother was indeed an active part of his life."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Fact 1: Dilation occurs when cell walls relax. Fact 2: An aneurysm is a dilation of a blood vessel.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","completion":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the upgraded version of the Mach 3 by sharing their dissatisfaction with its performance. The reviewer explicitly states that they cannot achieve a good shave with the new product, even after weeks of trying. This suggests that the user has given the product a fair chance to impress them, but ultimately, it falls below their expectations. Additionally, the reviewer compares the upgraded version unfavorably to its predecessor, the Mach 3. Their fondness for the Mach 3 demonstrates they are a loyal customer and were excited about the potential improvements in the upgraded version. However, their experience with the new product leaves them disillusioned, as it fails to provide the close shave they are accustomed to with the Mach 3. Furthermore, the reviewer deems the new product as \\"clumsy,\\" implying that it is uncomfortable or difficult to use. This lack of user-friendliness is another negative aspect that contributes to the unflattering portrayal of the product. In conclusion, the review paints an unfavorable picture of the product, as it outlines several drawbacks in comparison to the Mach 3, a beloved predecessor.

Please briefly summarize this news article: On Virginiaâs Crooked Road, Music Lights the Way Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times Mouth of Wilson, Va., on Route 58 along the Crooked Road in Virginia. IT starts with a well-worn fiddle, held in equally well-worn hands above a tapping black cowboy boot. Then in comes the banjo, plucked with steel finger picks, followed by the autoharp, the mandolin, the percussive beat of an upright bass. Another banjo grabs the melody, and suddenly the room is bursting with knee-slapping, country-porch music. A man in a crisp checked shirt gets up and starts to dance, bouncing out a complicated bumbumBAM bumbumBAM with his feet, moving as smoothly as a Martha Graham dancer, hitting the floor on the downbeat. Wade Petty plays the fiddle at the Fries Theater. It is Thursday night in Fries (pronounced freeze), Va., population 600, on the wide New River. In the century-old Fries Theater, the silk wallpaper, once a glorious aquamarine embossed with gold ferns, is faded. A sign promises movies for 10 cents, 25 cents on weekends, but there hasn’t been a film here in years. The Fries high school closed in 1989 after the cotton mill that gave birth to this hamlet in 1902 shut down. But where the economy has faltered, the local music culture is thriving. Take a drive through the dozens of one-stoplight towns that are planted along highways that twist through this region’s blue hills and green valleys, and you’ll find that music is the manna of the community. Fries was my first stop on the music trail known as the Crooked Road — an official designation of the state of Virginia since 2004. The heritage of the path can be found in this dance, in that tune, learned by ear from house to house and passed down through generations. The Road isn’t one single highway — it’s a roughly 300-mile series of interconnected two-lane byways and long stretches of Route 58, which skims Virginia’s North Carolina and Tennessee borders all the way to Kentucky. The sound here is Appalachian: mountain music. Joe Wilson, who wrote a book on the Crooked Road, calls the area the “pickle barrel” of American music. “You know you can’t make a good pickle by squirting vinegar on a cucumber,” he said. “You have to let it sit.” Over five days in April, I rambled along part of the Crooked Road and towns around it, from Fries up to Ferrum and Floyd, back to Galax and out to Marion, dipping down toward Abington, and back to Galax again. With my partner, Ian, his parents and my 2-year-old daughter, Orli, I drove down roads that curve so dramatically that locals joke that you can see your own taillights as you round the bends. The drive cuts through pastures dotted with cows and horses and weather-beaten barns, some abandoned and left to splinter. Many see the land they sold in recent decades now covered in Christmas trees, a boom industry that has changed the landscape. Churches rise up one after the other: Baptist, Pentecostal, Methodist. “Google Doesn’t Satisfy All Searches,” reads one church sign. “Can’t Sleep? Try Counting Your Blessings,” says another. We traveled 370 miles in all, what with switchbacks and retracing our steps to hear just one more tune. We were following the songs that had blown this way and that like so many dandelion seeds across the Blue Ridge Mountains and through the foothills of Appalachia. Our lodgings included everything from a Hampton Inn to an eco-minded auberge decorated by local artists, to a Ragtime-era hotel, recently restored to its former glory. ALONG the way we stuffed ourselves with buttery biscuits, farm eggs and smokehouse Southern flavors that somehow taste different south of the Mason-Dixon line. Orli loved every minute of it; her affinity for the music was immediate. When she ran onto the dance floor at the Floyd Friday Night Jamboree, the man next to me caught my arm. “Let her be,” he said. “We’re mountain people — we’ll take care of her as our own.” She woke each morning singing the twang of the banjo. If there ever was a place where musical authenticity was born and nurtured, “raised up” as the people around here say, the Crooked Road is it. From the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons (the site of Johnny Cash’s last concert) and Clintwood, deep in coal country, to the farms near Floyd, music is still being made on fiddles and banjos, mandolins and guitars, dulcimers and autoharps. Every night you’ll find pick-up jams on front porches, performances in theaters and quartets that pack storefronts, an old courthouse and even a Dairy Queen. In summer the area is awash in festivals, from Dr. Ralph Stanley’s Memorial Day bluegrass festival in the mountains of Coeburn, Va., to the venerable Old Fiddlers Convention held every August in Galax. This region is where old-time and bluegrass was born. Old-time is dance music, simpler and older than bluegrass. Bluegrass is filled with vocal harmonies, many made famous by (relative) newbies like Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. It is suited more for seated audiences than the foot-stomping dance I saw in Fries, which is known as flatfoot. Both genres evolved from tunes brought by Scotch-Irish and German settlers who traveled down the wagon trails from Pennsylvania. They brought dulcimers and fiddles and later picked up the banjo from former slaves. “It wasn’t real practical to bring a piano or an organ till there was a train,” said David Arnold, a Fries native whose wild white beard reached mid-sternum. I met him at a jam. It turned out he was the chairman of the Music Heritage Committee at the Grayson County Heritage Foundation in nearby Independence.

Imagine a road, all twisty and bendy, through green hills and blue valleys. This road is in a place called Virginia, and they call it the 'Crooked Road'. On this road, and in the small towns around it, you will find lots of people playing music. They play old instruments like the fiddle and banjo, and they play a kind of music that makes you want to dance and stomp your feet. In one of these small towns, there's an old theater where people get together to play their music. Even though the town and the theater are old, and some things aren't as busy as they once were, the people there love their music and play it with joy. The music they play is like a special secret passed down from generation to generation. This music has been carried around with them as they moved across the mountains and valleys. This is the same music that comes from the old country, carried by the original settlers who came from across the sea. They've been playing it ever since, and it's very important to them. This music has given shape to other kinds of music like bluegrass, that you may find familiar from some songs on the radio. It's special because it's still played in the way it was originally intended, for people to listen, dance, and be happy. The Crooked Road is a treasure trove for this unique and lively music. And that's the story behind the Crooked Road. A special place in Virginia where music lights the way. The people there are like one big family; they love their music and, as long as the music plays, they keep dancing with smiles on their faces."},{"prompt":"Given the question: She needed a new night table, what does she need to visit to get one legally?

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Sentence from a movie review: high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? Available options: [a]. negative; [b]. positive;","completion":"Based on the preceding review, it appears that the movie was seen positively. The reviewer seems to be highlighting unique aspects of the film in a somewhat enthusiastic and engaging manner. Allow me to break down the review into individual components to clarify the context behind my answer: 1. High drama: This phrase suggests that the movie has a compelling storyline, filled with dramatic and emotional moments. High drama is often considered a desirable attribute, as it indicates that the film is both engaging and memorable. 2. Disney-style: By referring to \\"Disney-style,\\" the reviewer seems to imply that the film possesses qualities typically associated with Disney movies. Disney is known for producing iconic animated and live-action films that generally evoke feelings of wonder, excitement, and inspiration. As such, this reference has a positive connotation. 3. A wing and a prayer: This idiomatic expression is used to describe situations in which success relies on hope or luck rather than skill or planning. In the context of this review, the reviewer likely refers to the movie's plot or a character facing challenges or pursuing something with limited chances of success. This creates an exciting narrative and invites the audience to root for the character, which can be a positive aspect of the film. 4. A hunky has-been: This phrase could generate positive or negative connotations based on its context. However, in the case of this review, the tone seems playful and lighthearted. The term \\"hunky\\" implies that the protagonist is attractive, while \\"has-been\\" suggests that the character might be attempting a comeback or redemption arc. This combination creates an interesting and sympathetic character for the audience to connect with at a deeper level. 5. Pursuing his castle in the sky: \\"Castle in the sky\\" is a metaphor for a lofty goal or unattainable dream. In the film's context, the character is pursuing an ambitious objective, which adds to the overall excitement and drama of the story. The reviewer's use of this phrase indicates appreciation for the character's ambition, which contributes to the movie's positive reception. Considering all these elements, the movie was seen positively based on the preceding review. Therefore, the correct answer is [b]. positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring planets identical to Earth in size and atmospheric conditions behaved differently towards their environments. Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer, while Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products. Answer this question please: Which planet had higher levels of UV reaching it? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the situations on both planets. On Planet A, there is a lot of air pollution, which leads to the destruction of the ozone layer. On Planet B, the environment is respected, and ecological products are used, which indicates less air pollution. Step 2: Determine the impact of air pollution on the ozone layer. Air pollution, particularly chlorine and bromine gases, destroy the ozone layer. The ozone layer is responsible for filtering out harmful UV radiation from the sun. Step 3: Determine the consequences of a diminished ozone layer. With a damaged or depleted ozone layer, higher levels of UV radiation reach the planet's surface, which can lead to harmful effects on living organisms, such as increased skin cancers, eye cataracts, and disruption of ocean food webs. Step 4: Compare the levels of UV radiation on both planets. Since Planet A has a destroyed ozone layer due to air pollution—while Planet B has a healthier ozone layer because of its eco-friendly practices—we can infer that Planet A will have higher levels of UV radiation reaching its surface, as the protective ozone layer is damaged. Answer: Planet A has higher levels of UV radiation reaching its surface."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: The back courtyard led to a walkout basement, where was it attached to?

The humor comes from the fact that instead of using ducks, the person has a polar bear, a seal, and a whale, which are not the traditional figures one would associate with duck races. It implies that the races didn't work as intended; hence, the use of the word \\"Especially\\" highlights the absurdity of the situation. The sentiment expressed in this tweet can be described as a mix of amusement, playfulness, and lightheartedness. The amusement comes from the whimsical idea of having duck races in the bath, while the playfulness is evident from the person's attempt to have the races despite not having ducks. The use of a hashtag at the beginning engages the readers and encourages them to relate to the humor. Furthermore, the presence of the polar bear, seal, and whale adds an element of quirkiness to the scenario, bringing a touch of light-heartedness.

Movie title: Matilda Context: Matilda Wormwood is a genius, but her parents, Harry and Zinnia (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, respectively), ignore and mistreat her. At the age of 4, she discovers the local library and walks there every day to read while her father is at work, her mother is playing bingo, and her older brother, Michael (Brian Levinson), is at school. At age six-and-a-half, Matilda begins to lose patience with her parents, expressing a desire to go to school. In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she adds hydrogen peroxide to his hair tonic, turning his hair an unhealthy blonde. He takes his children to his workshop, where he reveals that the cars he sells are faulty. Matilda accuses him of being dishonest and he belittles her, so she responds by putting super glue on his hat, forcing Zinnia to cut it off of his head. She reads a borrowed library copy of Moby-Dick, which Harry rips up while her family is watching television. When he forces her to watch with them, she becomes increasingly angry and causes the television set to suddenly explode. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris) is the tyrannical principal of a rundown elementary school, Crunchem Hall. Harry enrolls Matilda there, where she befriends several children and learns of Trunchbull's violent nature and overtly harsh punishments of the students. Matilda's teacher, Jennifer \\"Jen\\" Honey (Embeth Davidtz), is a kind woman who adores her class and takes an immediate liking to Matilda. She requests to Trunchbull that Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. That night, Miss Honey pays the Wormwoods a visit to encourage them to spend more time with Matilda, but they snub her.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: You may have heard the term \\"the American Dream\\". In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Question: Why did most of the early immigrants work as railroad laborers? - Because they could earn more money as railroad laborers. - Because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. - Because they thought railroad was the first step to find gold. - Because railroad laborers were greatly honored at that time. Answer:","completion":"Most of the early immigrants worked as railroad laborers because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. The arrival of people from Europe and a large number of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century were driven by the \\"American Dream\\" hoping to find gold in the U.S., but instead, many ended up working as railroad laborers. The text does not mention that they chose this job because it paid more, was the first step to finding gold, or because it was a greatly honored position. They likely took whatever work they could find to support themselves, and for many, this was as railroad laborers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is the first time he comes to this town. He comes to see his good friend, Peter. Peter is a doctor. He works in a hospital. But David doesn't know where the hospital is. He walks in the street. He passes a bank, a post office, a hotel and at last he goes to a school. Some students are coming out, so he asks one of the students, \\"Excuse me. Which is the way to People's Hospital?\\" \\"Well, I know, you can go along this street, take the second turning on the right, and then take the third turning on your left.

Options: A: a policeman B: a teacher C: a student D: a doctor Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, David asks a student for directions to the hospital. Therefore, the correct option to fill in the blank in the sentence \\"David doesn't know the way to the hospital and asks ____\\" is C: a student. In the narrative, it's stated that David, visiting a town he is unfamiliar with, is trying to find his good friend Peter at the hospital where he works. However, David does not know where the hospital is located. During his wanderings, he passes a variety of buildings including a bank, a post office, a hotel, and finally a school. Presumably understanding that students may have local knowledge and could guide him better, he decides to ask one of them for directions to the People's Hospital. The student that David speaks to responds with a complicated set of directions. When David admits that he can't follow them, the student kindly offers to take him to the hospital as it is on their way home. The student suggests that they travel together via the No.12 bus. There is no mention in the text of David asking a policeman, a teacher, or a doctor for directions. Therefore, options A, B, and D can be disregarded as incorrect responses.

Innocent then offered the Kingdom of Naples to Charles VIII of France, who had a remote claim to its throne because his grandfather, Charles VII, King of France, had married Marie of Anjou of the Angevin dynasty, the ruling family of Naples until 1442. Innocent later settled his quarrel with Ferdinand and revoked the bans before dying in 1492, but the offer to Charles remained an apple of discord in Italian politics.

When kite surfer Cameron Dietrich and Colin Sutton spotted the distressed sea turtle they quickly dived in the ocean to try to rescue it. Scroll down for video. Touching: A sea turtle swims nose-to-nose with Cameron Dietrich after he freed it from tangled fishing nets. Rescue: Dietrich uses a dive knife to cut away the tangled mess of nets that had wrapped around the turtle. 'When I saw the turtle tangled up I jumped in the water and began to cut it free,' Dietrich told MailOnline. 'It was totally worn out from fighting for its life for last probably 12 to 20 hours.' Using a dive knife, Dietrich carefully cut away the tangle of rope and netting that had wrapped itself around a front fin, while Sutton helped the turtle to float. Once it had been freed, Dietrich described how he stayed beneath the turtle to make sure it had the strength to swim after its traumatic experience. Reassured that the turtle was going to be fine, Dietrich swam away from it, stopping a short distance away to watch the creature. But in an unexpected move, the turtle slowly circled back and returned to the surfer, stopping inches from his face and letting him gently hold it, as if to say thanks. Dietrich and his friends spotted the turtle in distress while they were spear fishing off the Mexico coast. Colin Sutton films on a GoPro camera as Dietrich dives in to help the turtle. Professional kite surfer Dietrich said sadly it has become common to see turtles and other wildlife injured by debris dumped in the oceans. 'It returned back to me on top of my chest and came right up to my face and. let me touch its under shell,' he said. 'It got right up to my mask then swam off.' 'For me, it was an unusual and wonderful moment,' he added. 'After it came up to my face it swam off into the blue straight.' Dietrich told MaiOnline that as a professional watersports athlete he has seen many animals trapped by the debris dumped in the oceans. 'We are being poor stewards of our ocean. It bothers me to both see the disregard for our planet but also the endangering of animals,' he said. Since the video of the touching rescue was uploaded on YouTube earlier this month it has been viewed more than 1.9 million times. The friends work quickly to free the sea turtle, which calmly allowed Dietrich to get close. The freed sea turtle started to swim away before suddenly turning back towards Dietrich.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing... Answer:","completion":"Instead of using a machine, Moore carved the relief of The Virgin and Child directly, marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year? Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","completion":"From the given information, it seems that Rob would not observe the quarrying effect, also known as plucking, this year when he visited the Ural Mountains in Russia. This is because the description indicates that this specific type of glacial erosion is particularly associated with valley glaciers, which Rob saw last year in the Alps but did not encounter during his visit to the Ural Mountains. Quarrying, or plucking, happens when a glacier, specifically a valley glacier, moves along a valley. The basal ice at the lower part of the glacier melts as a result of friction, soaking into cracks and crevices in the bedrock. Upon refreezing, the ice can cause these cracks to expand through a process known as hydraulic wedging - a phenomenon that takes place due to volume changes related to the transition between ice and water. This process eventually dislodges large pieces of rock called joint blocks, which then become embedded within the moving glacier. Over time, these joint blocks contribute to the sculpting and reshaping of the valley through which the glacier is moving, leading to the erosion seen in many glaciated landscapes. Since the Ural Mountains did not have any valley glaciers during Rob's visit this year as per the provided information, it means that there were no suitable conditions for the quarrying process to occur. Hence, Rob would not have observed the effects of quarrying during this particular trip. On the other hand, during his trip to the Alps last year, Rob encountered a valley glacier, so it is likely that he would have observed signs of the quarrying effect. To witness this phenomenon, he may have spotted the joint blocks that had been dislodged from the bedrock and embedded in the ice or recognized patterns of erosion in the mountainous landscape. It's important to note though, that while valley glaciers are known for their quarrying effect, it doesn't necessarily mean that every valley glacier Rob comes across will showcase signs of quarrying. A lot depends on the specific environmental conditions, the glacier’s rate of movement, the characteristics of the bedrock, and the temperature - factors that can mean the difference between observable erosion activity and a seemingly static block of mountain ice. However, in general terms and based on the information provided, Rob would likely not have noticed the quarrying effect during his trip to the Urals this year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Try convincing yourself of the value of overcoming this fear. Make a list of advantages and disadvantages to spending time alone. Remember to consider the cost of this fear on your relationships, your own passions, and your self-development. For instance, you may decide that you will spend fifteen minutes alone without calling, texting, or messaging anyone, and as long as you need to process those fifteen minutes. This process might take place four times a week. Make exposure gradual and take into consideration how bad your fear is. This process takes time and should not be rushed. Plan to be alone for short spurts. Little by little, you will want to plan increased amounts of time alone until you don’t feel overcome with panic. Try making an exposure hierarchy in which you rank feared situations on a scale of 0-100 according to how afraid you anticipate being when exposed to it. For example, you may rank spending an hour alone at home at 100, but going to a movie alone a 70. By ranking you can work up to overcoming gradually greater fears only once fear subsides for the less threatening fears. Try exposing yourself to a lower-ranked fear. At first you’ll feel incredibly nervous and anxious, and this is normal. In time, your body will relax. After a few highly uncomfortable attempts, this will be a way to signal to yourself that you are capable of spending time alone. Exposing yourself to your fear will also help you think more deeply about the fears behind the initial panic. Don't become overly preoccupied with how panicked you feel and how stressed your body becomes. Because you are purposely exposing yourself to something you fear, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, and other physical symptoms of anxiety are normal. The longer the alone time, the greater the anxiety you will feel. But, with exposure, anxiety is expected and will dissipate with time. Gently push your limits until you are happy with how much alone time you can handle. Imagine you are going swimming--dipping your toes in the water can be exciting, but it won't adjust you to the temperature of the water. Another option is FearFighter, a computerized program of self-help methods that treat phobias.It is endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and proven effective. Because exposure can be so stressful, you may want a reliable way to distract yourself in the moment. Try reciting a few lines of a poem to yourself, doing arithmetic in your head, or whispering encouraging phrases to yourself, like \\"this feeling will pass, I have handled it before\\". Remember, the less often you use your crutch, the more intensive the exposure sessions will be. During and after your exposure sessions, record your level of fear on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 is fully relaxed and 10 is as fearful as you can imagine being. Doing this will show you how desensitized you have become to being alone and how much fear you were safely able to handle. Note trends in the sessions when anxiety seems especially high or low. Do you see any other factors that affect your fear, like the weather, or who you spent time with earlier in the day? You can also use the journal to write encouraging thoughts, difficulties, and anything else that \\"comes up\\" related to the fear. This will help you know yourself and your underlying patterns better. Summary:","completion":"The article highlights the importance of overcoming the fear of spending time alone and provides a detailed approach to tackling this fear. Creating a list of advantages and disadvantages of spending time alone can be helpful in understanding its impact on relationships, passions, and self-development. The key is to start with gradual exposure to alone time, planning and increasing the duration incrementally until the fear subsides. An exposure hierarchy can be utilized, where one ranks different situations on a scale of 0-100 based on the anticipated level of fear. Starting with lower-ranked fears and progressively moving to higher-ranked ones allows individuals to slowly adapt and feel more comfortable in such situations. Physical symptoms of anxiety, such as shallow breathing or increased heart rate, are normal when purposely exposing oneself to fear. With time, anxiety is expected to decrease as the exposure increases. Some people may need distraction techniques, like reciting a poem or doing arithmetic, to help cope with the stress. It is essential to record and track one's progress using a fear scale ranging from 0 (fully relaxed) to 10 (highest fear). This helps in understanding the level of desensitization achieved and any specific trends that affect the anxiety. Other options, such as the FearFighter program, can also be helpful in overcoming the fear of spending time alone. The ultimate goal is to understand oneself better, recognize the underlying patterns and thoughts, and ultimately develop the confidence to comfortably spend time alone without fear."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ideally, the daytime temperature while the cauliflower is maturing will be around 60ºF (15.5ºC). This means that the proper planting time depends on your climate: Cool climates: If your late summer temperatures are below 80ºF (27ºC), you can plant cauliflower for a fall harvest. Start the seeds 8 to 12 weeks before the first fall frost. Warm climates: If you have frost-free winters, you can plant cauliflower seeds later in autumn, once temperatures have dropped below 80ºF (27ºC). Harvest in winter or early spring. Temperate climates: Spring-planted cauliflower is difficult to grow in most climates. The coastal valleys of California are the only major exception, and can support year-round crops. Cauliflower is one of the most temperature-sensitive vegetables around. If the temperature requirements above seem difficult to achieve in your area, you can make the job easier with one or more of these tactics: Look for \\"summer\\" or \\"tropical\\" varieties that can handle warmer temperatures than most. Wait about a month after the recommended seed-starting date and buy a transplant from a garden store. Plant a new batch every week for 4–6 weeks to see which works best. Though they require cool weather, paradoxically, cauliflower also require a fair amount of full sun during the day. Choose a spot for planting in your garden that receives full sun and isn't shaded by trees, tall grass, or other crops. You'll also want to make sure that your growing site has ample room for your cauliflower crop. Generally, cauliflower plants will need to be spaced about 18-24 inches apart. For a good cauliflower crop, the plant's growth must be completely uninterrupted. This means that the plant must receive consistent moisture and have access to sufficient nutrients as it matures. A good soil makes meeting both of these requirements much easier. Ideally, your cauliflower's soil should have the following qualities: High organic matter content. This enhances the soil's ability to hold moisture. High potassium and nitrogen content. Potassium and nitrogen are nutrients vital for the cauliflower's development. If these are not present in the soil, it may be necessary to use fertilizer. A pH of between 6.5 and 7. This \\"sweet\\" pH range minimizes the danger of a cauliflower disease called clubroot and maximizes nutrient availability. Cauliflower has a reputation for being somewhat fragile. Many people start with seedlings from a local garden store to transplant into their garden. If you have seeds instead, plant them indoors to protect the young plants from weather: Plant each seed in its own peat or paper cup. The biodegradable container lets you \\"plant\\" the whole pot in your garden later without damaging the cauliflower's roots. Press the seed about 1/4–1/2 inch (0.6–1.25 cm) deep and cover it with dirt. Water regularly so the soil is moist but not waterlogged. In cold weather, keep the soil at 70º F (21º C) with bottom heat from a warming plate. If you must plant your seeds directly in the garden, plant them in rows 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) apart. Whether you grew the plants from seed or bought them from a garden nursery, you'll need to move them outdoors once they have three or four true leaves: Before transplanting, move the seedlings outside for one hour a day. Gradually increase this time over the course of a week to \\"harden off\\" the seedlings, adapting them to outdoor conditions. If you used a biodegradable container, bury the container in the ground so the soil level is even with the rest of the garden. If you used a non-biodegradable container, remove the seedling carefully to avoid breaking its roots. Make a small hole in the ground and bury the seedling up to its stem. You may want to make a shallow, saucer-like depression around the seedling to help the surrounding soil retain water. Firm the soil and water the seedling.","completion":"Cauliflower needs cool weather and lots of sunlight to grow properly.

Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water. Question: Bacteria which cause food to go bad _ . Answer: A:","completion":"Bacteria which cause food to go bad have their activity checked when the water content in the food is removed. This is because bacteria rely on moisture to thrive and reproduce. Dehydrating food through various methods, such as sun-drying or mechanical drying, reduces the amount of water present, inhibiting bacterial growth and extending the shelf life of the food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - The Luna programme (from the Russian word \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures. - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys . - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\"). - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

Choices: - sea world - tomales bay - great oceans - the key - tropical waters The rationale to choose \\"great oceans\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The shark was sick of the confines of its tank because it was longing for the vast expanse and freedom offered by the \\"great oceans.\\" As a magnificent creature naturally adapted to life in the open ocean, the shark was feeling trapped and restrained within the limited boundaries of its tank. The other options presented do not offer the same level of fulfillment and satisfaction to the shark's inherent nature. Here's a detailed breakdown of each choice and why \\"great oceans\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Sea World: While Sea World is larger than a simple aquarium tank, it still represents confinement within an artificial environment designed for entertainment and education purposes. Although it may be better than its current situation, the shark would still not experience the freedom and natural environment that the great oceans provide, where they can roam vast distances, follow migration paths, and engage in natural behaviors. 2. Tomales Bay: Tomales Bay is a relatively small, shallow body of water located in Marin County, California. Although it is a natural environment, its size and geographical limitations would still restrict the shark's movements and activities. Tomales Bay does not provide the vast open spaces and rich biodiversity found in the great oceans that the shark yearns for. 3. Great Oceans: The great oceans aptly represent the vast expanses of open water that our planet has to offer. They provide the shark with a truly unrestricted environment, where it can pursue its natural instincts, feed on a balanced and varied diet, interact with other marine life, and engage in reproductive behaviors essential for the survival of its species. The shark's longing for the great oceans is a reflection of its inherent need to thrive in a habitat that allows it to live a full and healthy life, unrestricted by artificial confines. 4. The Key: The key here seems to represent a metaphorical concept or a tangible object required for escaping the tank. Although it may be a necessary component for the shark's liberation, obtaining the key does not directly address the shark's underlying desire for the vastness and freedom provided by the great oceans. The key simply isn't a destination or environment that the shark is looking for. 5. Tropical Waters: While tropical waters offer a diverse and vibrant ecosystem, they still represent only a specific and limited type of environment. The shark's discontent with its tank suggests that it longs for a broader range of habitats and greater freedom to roam. The great oceans contain not only tropical waters but also temperate and polar environments, offering the shark a much greater diversity of experiences than a single type of habitat. In conclusion, the shark's yearning for the great oceans stems from its inherent desire to live in an unrestricted, natural environment abundant with diverse marine life and ecosystems. This option offers the shark the greatest opportunity for a fulfilling life, complete with opportunities to engage in natural behaviors essential for its overall well-being and the continuation of its species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a grammatical mood: conditional, second-person or imperative?\\" is in \\"The infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, můžu tě slyšet—\\"I can hear you\\"). Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural. The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information you provided, the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a grammatical mood: conditional, second-person or imperative?\\" is \\"second-person.\\" The second-person is not a grammatical mood but rather a grammatical person. In the context of grammar, a person refers to the distinction in the verb form due to the identity of the person performing or represented by its argument, and it includes first person, second person and third person. On the other hand, grammatical moods, like conditional and imperative, refer to the mode or manner in which the action of a verb is represented. As mentioned in the text you provided, Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative, and conditional. The imperative mood is used for issuing commands, while the conditional mood expresses possible events or hypothetical or imagined situations.

Prices are high (now this is a relative opinion, but it is a re-sale shop, some used or collectible items are being sold at retail prices), the inventory isn't as good, organization is terrible, and it just have a nice feel to it. The clothes are usually priced decently. I don't usually go through the clothes, though.

The reviewer starts by praising the thrift store's past performance but quickly shifts gears, highlighting a decline in its appeal over time.

The ritual is unknowingly witnessed by Sylvia, a young girl who has been observing them from the trees. Sylvia is eventually spotted by one of the members and is dragged in front of the group. She manages to run away but is soon caught and raped by several of the cult members. The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the local bakery, and Pete, Sylvia's younger brother. They return Sylvia home to her grandfather, Doc Banner. Mildred seeks help from her boyfriend, leader of the construction crew working on the nearby dam which has bought up most of the town leaving it deserted. The cult members' van breaks down so they elect to remain in the town. They buy pies from Mildred who explains that as most of the town is deserted and awaiting demolition they can stay in any vacant building they wish. Learning of the assault on Sylvia, Doc confronts the cult but they assault him and force him to take LSD. Pete intervenes and Doc is released. Enraged by the incident, Pete takes a shotgun to get revenge but encounters a rabid dog which he shoots. He takes blood from the dog and the next morning injects it into meat pies at the bakery, and sells them to the cult members. Back at their house, Horace and the others eat the meat pies. The others begin to show signs of infection, and eventually they lapse into animalistic behavior. The infected members then proceed to attack and kill each other in a feral rage.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that was abroad for much of the intervening period of Nuffield? , can you please find it? Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music.

Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B.

It is a work of social commentary, and condemns rural depopulation and the pursuit of excessive wealth. - Trinity College is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, a research university in Ireland. The college was founded in 1592 as the \\"mother\\" of a new university, modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, but, unlike these, only one college was ever established; as such, the designations \\"Trinity College\\" and \\"University of Dublin\\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. It is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland, as well as Ireland's oldest university. - The Vicar of Wakefield subtitled A Tale, Supposed to be written by Himself is a novel by Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith (17281774). It was written from 1761 to 1762 and published in 1766. It was one of the most popular and widely read 18th-century novels among Victorians. - The Good-Natur'd Man is a play written by Oliver Goldsmith in 1768. The play was written in the form of a comedy and staged at the Covent Garden Theatre. It was a middling success for Goldsmith, and the printed version of the play became popular with the reading public. It was released at the same time as Hugh Kelly's \\"False Delicacy\\" was staged at Drury Lane Theatre and the two plays went head to head with Kelly's proving the more popular. Garrick rejected \\"The Good-Natur'd Man\\", possibly because the story is an antidote of \\"False Delicasy\\". - She Stoops to Conquer is a comedy by Anglo-Irish author Oliver Goldsmith that was first performed in London in 1773. The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in the English-speaking world. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have an enduring appeal, and is still regularly performed today. It has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923. Initially the play was titled \\"Mistakes of a Night\\", and indeed, the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778 John O'Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, \\"Tony Lumpkin in Town\\". - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - The University of Dublin, corporately designated the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters of the University of Dublin, is a university located in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1592 when Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter for Trinity College, as \\"the mother of a university\\", thereby making it Ireland's oldest operating university.

He is remembered for being Oliver Goldsmith 's ' learned savage ' of a tutor . - Oliver Goldsmith (10 November 1728 4 April 1774) was an Irish novelist, playwright and poet, who is best known for his novel \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766), his pastoral poem \\"The Deserted Village\\" (1770), and his plays \\"The Good-Natur'd Man\\" (1768) and \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" (1771, first performed in 1773). He is thought to have written the classic children's tale \\"The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes\\" (1765). What entity does 'theaker wilder' has the relation 'occupation' with? Answer:","completion":"The entity that 'Theaker Wilder' has the 'occupation' relation with is 'Trinity College, Dublin'. In this context, 'occupation' refers to the role, job, or profession that Theaker Wilder held. Theaker Wilder served as the first Regius Professor of Greek, Senior Register and Senior Fellow at Trinity College in Dublin. His responsibilities likely included teaching Greek, conducting scholarly research, and carrying out administrative duties within the college. His connection to Trinity College Dublin also extends to his mentoring role with Oliver Goldsmith, one of the notable figures in Irish literary history. Despite being perceived as a 'learned savage' by Goldsmith, Wilder's influence and teachings may likely have had an impact on Goldsmith's works and intellectual development. Therefore, it can be concluded that Theaker Wilder's occupation was closely tied to Trinity College in Dublin, and this role represented an essential facet of his professional life and identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the similarities and differences between Italian and Spanish. Both Italian and Spanish are Romance languages, which means they share similarities in vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure. These similarities make the translation process easier, as many words may be cognates or have similar meanings. Step 2: Translate each word or phrase from Italian to Spanish. - Ho lavorato: This phrase means \\"I have worked\\" in Italian. In Spanish, we keep the same idea by saying \\"He trabajado.\\" - con: This word means \\"with\\" in both Italian and Spanish, so we can leave it as it is. - le piante: In Italian, this means \\"the plants.\\" In Spanish, we use \\"las plantas\\" to express the same idea. - i batteri: This means \\"the bacteria\\" in Italian. In Spanish, the translation is \\"las bacterias.\\" - le seppie: This translates to \\"the cuttlefish\\" in Italian, but since \\"cuttlefish\\" and \\"squid\\" share similarities, we can use \\"los calamares\\" in Spanish for a more familiar term. - le mosche della frutta: This phrase means \\"the fruit flies\\" in Italian. The Spanish equivalent is \\"las moscas de la fruta.\\" Step 3: Combine the translated words and phrases to form the complete sentence in Spanish.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The nation of Greece is located in southeastern Europe at the southernmost tip of the Balkan Peninsula. It is strategically positioned at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Geographically, Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, the Republic of North Macedonia to the north, Bulgaria to the north and northeast, and Turkey to the northeast. It is bordered by the Ionian Sea to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the east. The country's total land area is approximately 131,957 square kilometers (50,949 square miles), and it includes numerous islands scattered across the Aegean and Ionian seas. The larger and more well-known Greek islands include Crete, Rhodes, Lesbos, and Corfu. There are around 6,000 islands and islets in total, of which only around 227 are inhabited. Greece's terrain is primarily mountainous, with about 80% of the country being covered by mountains or hills. Numerous mountain ranges extend across the mainland, such as the Pindus Mountains, which stretch from north to south, and form the country's natural backbone. The highest mountain in Greece, Mount Olympus, stands at 2,918 meters (9,573 feet) and is considered the mythical home of the ancient Greek gods. The climate in Greece is predominantly Mediterranean, characterized by hot and dry summers, as well as mild and wet winters. The coastal areas and islands experience a more moderate climate due to the influence of the seas, while the mountainous regions experience colder temperatures and occasionally heavy snowfall during winter months. Greece has a rich and diverse cultural history that dates back thousands of years. The country is often regarded as the cradle of Western civilization, owing to its profound impact on language, politics, philosophy, art, science, and sports, among other aspects of human endeavor. Ancient Greece was home to prominent figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, whose ideas and works have significantly influenced Western thought. The nation's capital and largest city is Athens, which is also considered one of the world's oldest cities. It is home to several iconic landmarks, such as the Parthenon and the Acropolis. Other major cities in Greece include Thessaloniki, Patras, and Heraklion. Today, Greece is a member of the European Union, the United Nations, NATO, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Now, I have a new situation: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back.

As he explains: They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey. Hasek's most memorable international performance came in the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he led the Czech national team to the gold medal. He allowed six goals in total, with only two of them coming in the medal round. Against Team Canada in the semifinals, Hasek stopped Theoren Fleury, Ray Bourque, Joe Nieuwendyk, Eric Lindros and Brendan Shanahan in a dramatic shootout win. He then shut out the Russian team 1-0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying: \\"When the game ended, I just threw my stick. I was so happy. When I saw the flag go up, I saw my whole career flash before my eyes from the first time my parents took me to a game until now.\\" His play made him one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic, so much so that residents chanted \\"Hasek to the castle!\\" in the streets, referring to the Prague Castle, the seat of the President of the Czech Republic. In response to this, Hasek called the president Vaclav Havel and jokingly told him that his job was not in jeopardy. He also helped to inspire an opera (titled Nagano) about the Czech team's gold medal victory, and in 2003, Petr Pravec and Lenka Sarounova named an asteroid (8217 Dominikhasek) in his honour. In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Hasek played for just nine minutes and twenty-five seconds, until he injured his right adductor muscle. Despite his absence, the Czechs managed to earn the bronze medal with backup goaltender Tomas Vokoun, which Hasek received as well.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the 1998 Olympic games the only games he played in?","completion":"No, the 1998 Olympic games were not the only games he played in.

It came as something of a surprise when Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997, to support the Red Cross's campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines. Within hours of arriving in Angola, television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims injured in explosions caused by landmines. \\"I knew the statistics,\\"she said. \\"But putting a face to those figures brought the reality home to me; like when I met Sandra, a 13- year-old girl who had lost her leg, and people like her. \\" The Princess concluded with a simple message. \\"We must stop landmines.\\" And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message. But, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as very \\"ill-informed\\"and \\" a loose cannon .\\" The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms,\\" This is a distraction we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\\" Opposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government. To try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was working towards a worldwide ban. The Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding. For the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause.

Perhaps you have complained about it because you thought it took you much playtime. But now you'd better thank your parents for their time and money spent on your musical training. A recent study suggests music lessons can make children have better memories than their peers . The Canadian study showed that after one year of musical training, children did better on a memory test than those who didn't take music lessons. The researchers made the children aged between 4 and 6 into two groups -- one group of children took music lessons outside school, and the other didn't take any musical training. In one year, they took four tests in different times. The results showed brain development changes at least every four months. The children taking music lessons not only did better in musical listening but also made faster progress in other ways, such as reading, writing, math and IQ. People say music is the good medicine for a broken heart. Now it seems music can also help us to improve our memories. We are sure to find more and more in the wonderful world of music.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the acronym for the the name of the strike committee? On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior.

When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch.

Ceskatelevize - one of the Czech Republic’s main broadcasters - started its 4pm broadcast with presenter Daniel Takac apparently unaware of the blunder. But newsroom journalists can be seen laughing in the background before the phallus is replaced by a picture of a green vegetable. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT. Shocking: A TV news station was flooded with complaints during an afternoon broadcast after showing a male's genitals on a monitor behind the show's anchor. A spokesman for the channel said: 'The image was actually part of a documentary, but we should have been aware of timing and not had that particular scene playing when we went on air. 'It was a silly mistake.' That may not impress regulators however who say that such images are banned on day time TV and warn that the broadcaster may face a severe fine once the investigation is complete. In August the BBC was forced to apologise after. broadcasting a picture of Prince William with a doodle of comedy. glasses, a moustache and a penis drawn on his head.

The. unusual picture of the Duke of Cambridge was broadcast as part of a. trailer used on BBC Breakfast for a feature on musical theatre group. Barbershopera. The clip, was taken from the group's comedy song I Could Have Married Kate. The BBC apologised and said that editors failed to spot the offending picture. But live TV can be a cruel mistress as reporter Siobhan Riley found out after she unwittingly drew a shape resembling a large penis on a Tuesday evening bulletin.

Given the question: Information: - The hawkfishes are strictly tropical, perciform marine fishes of the family Cirrhitidae associated with the coral reefs of the western and eastern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. They share many morphological features with the scorpionfish of the family Scorpaenidae. - Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes found on tropical reefs in the Indian and western Pacific oceans . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Boston ferns will do best in a potting mixture of peat moss, sand, and garden soil. You can buy all of these at your local gardening store. Your final mixture should be even parts of each ingredient. The pot should be big enough for your fern to sit comfortably without it's roots being near the drainage holes, but without a lot of extra space that could accumulate \\"root rot.\\" Put your mixture and plant into the clean pot with drainage holes in the bottom.The fern can be planted about half of the way to the top of the pot so that the roots have space in the soil. Fill in the rest of the pot with more potting mixture, leaving about 1 inch( 25.4 mm) of space from the top. In many places, the summers are warm and humid enough to provide the perfect environment for a Boston fern. They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors. You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well. The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing. If you are keeping your Boston fern indoors, whether permanently or just for the winter months, you will need to be careful about making sure it has adequate humidity. The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night. If you don’t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates. Boston ferns do best when receiving indirect, filtered sunlight. If they’re outdoors, place them somewhere where they will get sunlight through tree branches, or cracks in a porch roof. If they’re indoors, place them near a window. You don’t want your fern to be in shade, but you don’t want them to be in direct sunlight. It’s a delicate balance.

To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve’s classification of CRA loans as “prime” is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal “subprime” loans. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When did CRA make rule changes to relax underwriting standards?","completion":"The CRA, or Community Reinvestment Act, made rule changes to relax underwriting standards in 1995. This means that banks were allowed to lend money to people more easily, even if they didn't have everything they needed to show they could pay it back.

In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Paragraph: Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which boy will start developing muscles later? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jimothy will start developing muscles later. Since Jimothy is a freshman in high school, he is younger than Dwight, who is a junior. The age difference between the two brothers indicates that Dwight has already undergone more of the puberty process than Jimothy, including experiencing the adolescent growth spurt. This is further confirmed by the testosterone test results that show Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy. Testosterone plays a crucial role in boys' development during puberty, controlling not only their growth spurt but also the growth and development of muscles. As mentioned in the background information, the development of muscles occurs towards the end of the growth spurt in height. Since Dwight has reached an advanced stage in puberty as indicated by his higher testosterone levels, he is also expected to be further along in his muscle development. In comparison, Jimothy, being younger and at an earlier state of puberty, will start developing muscles later than Dwight. As his body continues to grow in height and his testosterone levels rise throughout puberty, he will eventually undergo muscle development towards the end of his adolescent growth spurt. However, this process of muscle growth and development is expected to occur after Dwight, due to the age difference and the different stages of puberty the two brothers are in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A number of countries forbid members of the legislature from accepting an office of profit under the executive as a means to secure the independence of the legislature and preserve the separation of powers. Is this statement correct \\"is office of profit mentioned in the constitution\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement is correct to some extent. The concept of the \\"office of profit\\" is indeed mentioned in various national constitutions across the globe, including those of India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It is important to note that the specific language and provisions surrounding the office of profit can vary between different jurisdictions and constitutional frameworks. In India, for example, the term \\"office of profit\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. However, the concept is still recognized and addressed in the Constitution under Articles 102(1)(a) and 191(1)(a). These provisions disqualify a member of Parliament or a State Legislature from holding an office of profit under the Government of India or the government of any state. In the United States, the concept of an \\"office of profit\\" is addressed within the Constitution under the Incompatibility Clause, which states in Article I, Section 6, Clause 2: \\"No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office.\\" This clause aims to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of the United States government. It also bars members of the U.S. Congress from simultaneously holding an office under the executive branch. In the United Kingdom, the concept of an \\"office of profit\\" is addressed within the constitutional laws and parliamentary conventions. The British constitution specifically disqualifies members of Parliament from holding a range of executive offices, such as Her Majesty's ministers or civil servants. One key example can be found in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, which lists a series of offices considered to be \\"offices of profit\\" and that holders of such offices are thereby disqualified from serving as members of Parliament. While the term \\"office of profit\\" may not necessarily be mentioned explicitly in every national constitution, the concept is still present and relevant in the constitutions of several countries. The fundamental goal behind addressing the \\"office of profit\\" issue is to prevent conflicts of interest, protect the independence of the legislature, and preserve the separation of powers between different branches of government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

Watching the news at the same time, following a report on Sammi's being banned from returning to Lakeridge High to perform at the Halloween dance, Eddie is shocked to hear the worst words to ever reach his ears: Sammi Curr has died in a mysterious hotel fire. Eddie is completely devastated. He goes to his friend \\"Nuke\\" (Gene Simmons), a radio DJ who knew Sammi Curr personally. To take Eddie's mind off the death of his idol, Nuke gives Eddie the only copy of Curr's last and as-yet unreleased album, \\"Songs in the Key of Death\\", on an acetate disc. Nuke has recorded the disc onto high quality tape and plans to play it in its entirety on-air at midnight on Halloween as a tribute since, according to Nuke, that was always Sammi's plan for the album's debut. Once back home, Eddie falls asleep while listening to the record and has a strange dream about the fire that killed Sammi Curr. When he wakes up he finds that the record is skipping and after listening to it for a few seconds he comes to realize that something is not quite right about the lyrics that the record is stuck on. Having previous experience with hidden lyrics, Eddie plays the record backwards, but receives more than he imagined: Sammi Curr speaking to him from beyond the grave.

Article: CAIRO (Reuters) - Cairo's Tahrir Square relived its glory days of the revolution on Friday as tens of thousands of flag-waving protesters called on the Egyptian army to relinquish power, in defiance of a stern communiqué from the generals criticizing the Muslim Brotherhood. All day, through weekly prayers in the baking midday sun to an evening clamor for change, demonstrators, mostly marshaled by the Islamist movement and its allies, called on the military to make good on promises to hand over to a civilian and end the prolonged uncertainty over last weekend's presidential election. With the result of the run-off between the Brotherhood's man and a former general expected by Sunday, there was an anxious mood as many vowed to follow their leaders' calls to camp out until the army also cancels an order curbing the powers of the new president and revokes its dissolution of parliament. \\"This is a classic counter revolution that will only be countered by the might of protesters,\\" said Safwat Ismail, 43, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who came from north Egypt. \\"I am staying in the square until the military steps down.\\" The generals flatly refused, heightening a sense of deadlock in achieving the democracy protesters thought they had won with blood spilt on Tahrir Square during last year's Arab Spring, though in the background, officials from army and Brotherhood have been talking, leading some to see a compromise ahead. In a brusque, four-minute statement read on state television as Egyptians were completing their Friday prayers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) stood by what critics at home and in the West have called a \\"soft coup\\" intended to prolong six decades of military rule many believed had ended. \\"The issuance of the supplementary constitutional decree was necessitated by the needs of administering the affairs of the state during this critical period in the history of our nation,\\" the off-screen announcer said, in the bureaucratic language favored by the generals who pushed aside fellow officer Hosni Mubarak last year to appease the angry millions on the streets. The Islamist presidential candidate, Mohamed Morsy, shot back that the generals were defying the will of the people and said protests would go on. But he stopped short of repeating a claim to have already won the election, urging simply a rapid announcement of the result, and praised the army as \\"patriotic\\". In what were menacing tones for the army's old adversary the Muslim Brotherhood, SCAF criticized their premature announcement of the election result as sowing division and said people were free to protest - but only if they did not disrupt daily life. PROTESTS At Tahrir, the broad traffic interchange by the Nile in central Cairo was filled with makeshift tents offering shade from the scorching sun, hawkers offering an array of goods from tea to \\"I Love Tahrir Square\\" T-shirts. Many knelt in prayer during the weekly service at noon. Large groups of pious Islamists were bused in from the provinces by their parties. The crowd, swelling when the heat of the day faded, chanted and waved Egyptian flags late into the evening. Mahmoud Mohammed, a bearded, 31-year-old marine engineer from Alexandria among a group from the fundamentalist Salafist movement camping on the square, insisted they were not looking for a battle, but wanted to see democracy installed. \\"The people elected a parliament and they put it in the rubbish bin. We need the army to hand over,\\" he said. \\"No one came here for a fight. We need democracy.\\" Smaller groups of secular activists joined the mainly Islamist throng but the absence of many of the liberal urban youth who drove the early days of the revolt against Mubarak has highlighted a weariness with turmoil and a dismay at politics which have boiled down to Egypt's familiar choice between army and religion, the two best organized institutions, at the expense of candidates from the fragmented centre ground. The deadlock between Egypt's two strongest forces has raised grave doubts about prospects for consensual democracy, though some see possible compromise, if Morsy does become president. But the army and Brotherhood have cooperated warily since Mubarak fell and sources on both sides say that may continue, despite the military council infuriating the Islamists last week by dissolving the new parliament, which they had dominated. The military council said on Friday it had no power to repeal the dissolution, saying that was down to judges who ruled some of January's election rules unconstitutional. Critics say the judges were appointed under Mubarak and are not impartial. ELECTION The Brotherhood fears a delay in announcing the result of the presidential election indicates an attempt to cheat - though opponents say it is the Islamists who are not playing fair. Morsy and former general Ahmed Shafik both say they believe they won the run-off ballot. But it is Morsy's declaration of victory within hours of polls closing which has driven debate about underhand tactics in a country long used to vote-rigging. The delay in publishing results, due on Thursday but not now expected until at least Saturday, is explained by officials as due to reviewing many appeals. But it has heightened anxiety on all sides, although most insist they will protest peacefully. Morsy told a news conference he would continue to reject SCAF's decree. \\"The constitutional declaration clearly implies attempts by the military council to restrict the incoming president,\\" he said. \\"This we totally reject.\\" But with no obvious resolution in sight to the stand-off, Morsy also made conciliatory references to the army. \\"There is no problem between us and our patriotic armed forces,\\" he said. CONSTITUTION \\"We do not agree to the issuing of the constitutional decree and neither do the people,\\" Morsy said. \\"Why do we need a supplementary declaration when we are going to draft a new constitution?\\" The decree has also given the military power to step in and force the pace of drafting a constitution, a process slowed in parliament by a lack of consensus between Islamists and other parties. Some lawmakers involved were due to meet again on Saturday to try to make progress and keep control. In a country where virtually no one can remember an election that was not rigged before last year, trust is low, not least among Brotherhood officials, many of whom, like Morsy, were jailed under Mubarak for their political activities. The same electoral commission that handed 90 percent of a November 2010 parliamentary vote to Mubarak's supporters - a result which fuelled the protests that brought him down a few weeks later - sits in judgment on the new presidency. Hassan Nafaa, a political analyst and critic of Mubarak, said. \\"The military council's statement is intended to scare the people and quell the revolutionary spirit of the nation through the firm authoritarian tone in which the statement was delivered. But this will not work because all politically aware civilians refuse the military's stewardship over the state.\\" Events of the past week, which also saw a renewal of the power of military police to arrest civilians, have troubled Western allies, notably the United States which has long been the key sponsor of the Egyptian armed forces but now says it wants to see them hand power to civilians. Adding to unease, Mubarak is himself back in the news, being transferred to a military hospital on Tuesday evening from the prison where he began a life sentence this month. Military and security sources have given a different accounts of his condition, from \\"clinically dead\\" at one point, to being on life support after a stroke to \\"stabilizing\\". Many Egyptians suspect his fellow generals may be exaggerating his illness to get their old comrade out of jail. (Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy and Mohamed Abdella; Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Louise Ireland) ||||| Tens of thousands have packed Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square to denounce a power grab by the ruling military, as the nation nervously awaited the results of the first post-Mubarak presidential election. Yet Egypt's ruling military warned it would \\"deal firmly\\" with any attempt to harm the public interest, and blamed political divisions on the release of unofficial presidential poll results by candidates. \\"Protecting the status of state institutions is a national responsibility for all: any attack on them threatens the stability and national security of Egypt,\\" said a Supreme Council of the Armed Forces statement read on state television on Friday afternoon. \\"Any attempts to harm public or private interests will be confronted with utmost firmness and strength by the police and armed forces within the law,\\" SCAF said. The SCAF defended a constitutional document giving it legislative powers, control over the new constitution and a broad say in government policy. \\"The issuing of a constitutional declaration was a necessity imposed by the needs of managing the affairs of the country during the current critical phase of the history of our nation,\\" the military council said. It instead blamed the tension in Egypt on the release of unofficial poll results. \\"The early release of the presidential election results, before the announcement by the responsible body, was unjustified and is one of the main reasons for divisions and tensions in the political arena,\\" SCAF said. Its comments appeared to be directed at the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, which said that its candidate Mohamed Morsi had won the election, providing what it said were certified copies of ballot tallies to bolster its claims. 'Neither confrontation nor violence' Morsi held a subsequent press conference following the release of SCAF's statement, where he said the Brotherhood wants neither \\"confrontation nor violence\\". But he added: \\"The expected result is known to everyone. We will not allow anyone to tamper with the result.\\" \\"We expect that the result will truly reflect the popular will, which we all know,\\" said Morsi, adding that the thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square were there to \\"guarantee that will\\" is respected. Morsi was speaking at a news conference in Cairo, flanked by several liberal and leftist figures. He slammed a constitutional declaration issued by the ruling military council that granted the army sweeping powers, as well as the dissolution of parliament and a justice ministry decision giving soldiers powers of arrest. \\"We reject all this... and the timing concerns us all,\\" said Morsi. But he pledged that his movement and supporters did not have any plans to clash with the military council or to instigate unrest. \\"There will be no confrontation or violence or attempts to shake the stability of this country,\\" he said. \\"The protection of the nation is our highest goal, (including) the protection of its institutions, public and private property.\\" 'Down with military rule' Members and supporters of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood gathered in the square for the protest on Friday, which was to be joined later in the afternoon by several secular movements. Protesters used umbrellas, newspapers and hats to shield themselves from the brutal sun, as they chanted \\"down with military rule.\\" Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from Tahrir Square, said the crowds \\"dismissed the statement\\" released by the SCAF earlier in the day. He went on to say that the crowd gathered in Tahrir were made up of different political supporters. \\"This is probably the most united display of protest seen for a long period of time.\\" \\"The Muslim Brotherhood has called for protesters to come here, but they have been joined the revolutionary socialists, and the salafi Al Nour party, so this is a wide expanse of political opposition expressed in the square.\\" Those camping out overnight demanded military rulers reverse new orders that entrench the generals' power and called on the election commission to declare the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi president. Across town, in a luxury international hotel, former general Ahmed Shafik, who was Hosni Mubarak's prime minister when the army forced out the dictator to appease the Tahrir protesters, challenged Morsi's self-proclaimed victory and said he was sure he had won. At a televised address to whooping and cheering supporters, Shafik said: \\"These protests in the squares, the campaigns of terror and the media manipulation are all attempts to force the election committee to announce a particular result.\\" Speaking in person rather than through spokesmen as he has through the week, he added: \\"I am fully confident that I will be the legitimate winner.\\" He called for calm and unity, saying he would invite opponents to join his administration. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it held concerns over the military's commitment to hand over power to civilian rule. \\"The generals' relentless expansion of their authority to detain and try civilians now goes far beyond their powers under Hosni Mubarak,\\" Joe Stork, HRW Middle East director, said in a statement \\"These decrees are the latest indication yet that there won't be a meaningful handover to civilian rule on June 30,\\" Stork added. The Election Commission did not say when it would announce the winner of the runoff. But its secretary-general, Hatem Begato, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram that the winner would be announced on Saturday or Sunday. Allegations of fraud The commission said the announcement was postponed from Thursday because a panel of judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by both campaigns, including lawyers for Shafik claiming fraud in 14 of Egypt's 27 provinces. The lawyers said ballots sent to polling centers were already marked for Morsi. Morsi's lawyers accused Shafik of buying votes and being involved in forging lists of registered voters to include soldiers, who are barred from voting, and names of the dead. The Brotherhood says it is being targeted by an organised campaign to keep it out of the presidency, and that even if Morsi is declared the victor, he will face deep resistance that will make it impossible for him to govern. After two days of voting that ended on Sunday, the group declared Morsi won 52 per cent of the vote. Shafiq's camp on Monday announced he had won 51.5 per cent of the vote. ||||| Egypt's ruling military council has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for raising tensions in the country by releasing election results early.

This movie is very entertaining, and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality. Other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes. As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was \\"chosen\\" - - to protect the Golden Child. The young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector. Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice. This is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. As we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us. This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art fighting, and Eddie Murphy humor.

After two days of enduring criticism for not finishing the game and getting suggestions on how to avoid cramps, James changed the subject. \\"What happened on Thursday was Thursday,\\" James said. \\"My whole focus was how I was going to try to help this team even this up and just try to make some plays.\\" He had a key strip of Tony Parker down the stretch, playing a dominant game on both ends as if he had something to prove. As usual, James found a way to silence his haters. He had 11 points in the second quarter, helping Miami erase an 11-point deficit early in the period. The game was played within a margin of a few points from there, and the Spurs missed a chance to seize control in the fourth quarter when Parker and Tim Duncan missed four straight free throws when they had a two-point lead. James then made a 3-pointer and two free throws to put Miami in position to win. Parker scored 21 points and Duncan had 18 points and 15 rebounds for the Spurs, who had won eight straight at home by at least 15 points. \\"Down the end there they executed really well,\\" Duncan said. \\"LeBron made some great passes and guys made open shots. We had the same result in the first game. They kind of flipped it in this one.\\" The game was played in comfortable conditions inside the AT&T Center, where an air conditioning failure in Game 1 sent temperatures soaring to about 90 degrees. The broken circuit breaker was fixed by Friday afternoon, and it was much cooler inside the arena. James had the toughest time with the heat Thursday, needing treatment midway through the fourth quarter before eventually having to leave for good. He had plenty of time to recover, with the two days off between Games 1 and 2. He changed only a little of his routine, taking an 8 a.m. yoga class Sunday morning and switching to a shorter pair of tights. He personally erased a 62-56 San Antonio lead by scoring eight points in less than a minute, and his 14 points in the third quarter had Miami down only 78-77 heading to the fourth. \\"For me, once I get into a good groove, I feel like everything is going to go in,\\" James said. For a time, everything did. Then he switched to being a passer at the end, finding Bosh in the corner for the shot that made it 95-93. Wade and Rashard Lewis each scored 14 points for the Heat, who also dropped Game 1 of the NBA Finals against Oklahoma City two years ago. They have won five straight series after dropping the opening game. The Spurs were in good position, withstanding James' assault long enough to lead by one with under 2 minutes to play. But they were shut out from there until Manu Ginobili's 3-pointer as time expired. \\"LeBron with the ball did a pretty good job at his end and we had to be really perfect at the other end and we didn't,\\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \\"We didn't take advantage of things. We made bad decisions.\\" And it didn't help them that they had to deal with James at the end of this one. Ginobili finished with 19 points for the Spurs, whose 18 points in the fourth quarter were half the 36 they scored in the opener. \\"We have a very competitive group and you have two days to commiserate how that game went down,\\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \\"It was frustrating, painful going through that for two days and now we have to manage the other emotion.\\" After their sensational finish to Game 1, the Spurs picked up right where they left off, making 10 of their first 15 shots. They opened an 11-point lead early in the second before James got going. He had three straight Miami baskets, and a follow shot later in the period gave the Heat their first lead at 34-33. Notes: Parker has 1,026 assists in the postseason, moving past Michael Jordan (1,022) for eighth place on the career postseason list. He also passed Jordan's Hall of Fame teammate, Scottie Pippen, for 13th on the career scoring list with 3,655 points.

Solve -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 for j.","completion":"To solve the equation -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 for j, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the j terms and the constant terms. On the left side of the equation, we have two j terms: -140*j and 48*j. Combining these will give us: (-140 * j + 48 * j) = -92 * j Next, combine the constant terms, -787 and -317: -787 - 317 = -1104 Now the simplified equation looks like this: -92 * j - 1104 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable j To isolate j, we need to get rid of the -1104 on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 1104 to both sides: -92 * j - 1104 + 1104 = 0 + 1104 This will simplify to: -92 * j = 1104 Now, to isolate j completely, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -92: (-92 * j) / -92 = 1104 / -92 This will give us the solution: j = -12 So the solution to the equation -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 is j = -12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do that, we're going to add 17740 and 11900 to both sides of the equation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? The more information you have, the more likely you'll be able to stay calm when it happens. Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. It may appear as bright red drops in your underwear, or it could be brownish and sticky. Don't worry that you will be gushing blood, either; during an average period, a woman will only lose about 1 oz. (30 ml) of blood. That's about the same amount of liquid as 2 bottles of nail polish. Talk to your mom or older sister. They may be able to give you an idea of when you will get your period. It's not always the same, but often girls begin their periods around the age as their mother or sisters did. If you can't talk to a mom or older sister, talk to a school nurse or trusted friend who has already gotten her period. When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all. If you have a blood phobia and you're worried about how you'll react, try thinking of it this way: this isn't blood like from a wound or injury. The blood from your period is actually a sign that you're healthy. The drugstore or grocery store usually has an entire aisle dedicated to feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, pantyliners). Don't be overwhelmed by all the choices; as you get to know your flow, you'll have a better idea of which product works best for you. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky or noticeable and has light or medium absorbency.. Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with; you'll have enough to think about without worrying about how to insert a tampon. Practice putting a pad in your underwear before you have your period. If you notice discharge in your underwear, use that to figure out where the middle of the pad should be. Some websites offer coupons or even free samples or period \\"starter kits\\" for you to keep on-hand. If you'd rather use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that's completely fine. It's important that you are comfortable with whichever protection you choose. If you're embarrassed about buying pads, just go up to the register with a few other items, and busy yourself looking at candy while the cashier rings you up. Remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to him or her. With all the time you spend at school, playing sports, going to friend's houses, and doing other activities, it's possible, even likely, you will get your period while you are away from home. It may give you peace of mind to know you always have a pad with you wherever you are, just in case. If you're worried about someone going through your book bag and finding your stash or things falling out, get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies. You may want to hide a pair of underwear and a resealable plastic bag in your locker in case you get your period at school and need to change your panties. You can rinse the soiled pair in cold water and put them in the bag to take home. You may also want to keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain medication in your locker, just in case you get cramps. Just make sure your school policy allows this so you don't get in trouble. While there's no single indication that your period is arriving, you won't really know until it comes; your body may give you signs that it is preparing to menstruate. A stomach or backache, cramps in your abdomen, and sore breasts can all be signs that you are getting your period. Women can get their first periods as early as 8 and as old as 16. Most usually get theirs around the age of 11 or 12. Women usually get their periods about two years after they begin developing breasts. You may notice a thick, white discharge in your underpants up to 6 months before getting your first period. Your period usually comes after you have reached 100 pounds (7 stone). If you are underweight, this may delay your period. If you are overweight, you may begin your period sooner.

The full sentence would read as follows: \\"The cruise itinerary was changed to replace the movie with the musical, as the musical was skyrocketing in popularity.\\" This choice indicates that the cruise organizers decided to alter the entertainment schedule on the ship to accommodate passengers' growing interest in the musical. The decision to substitute the movie with the musical implies that the cruise management recognized the potential for increased satisfaction among guests by providing a more in-demand form of entertainment. Such changes are often made in response to rising trends or unforeseen events, as cruise lines strive to meet the needs and preferences of their passengers. By monitoring interest in various forms of entertainment, cruise organizers can adapt their itineraries accordingly to ensure a memorable and enjoyable experience for all guests on board. In this instance, replacing the movie with the musical was likely seen as a strategic choice to both capitalize on its popularity and position the cruise as a dynamic and flexible entertainment provider. By making these adjustments, cruise organizers demonstrate their commitment to consistently evaluate and refine their programming to accommodate passengers' changing preferences, ensuring that guests can fully engage with the onboard experience. Furthermore, the skyrocketing popularity of the musical may be attributed to a variety of factors, such as its timeless appeal, talented performers, or recent global events that have reinvigorated interest in the genre.

Feel the pads of the kitten's feet and place your finger in the kitten's mouth. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm Options: I. Yes; II. It's impossible to say; III. No;","completion":"III. No; The statement \\"kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm\\" does not directly follow from the given text. It is not accurate to conclude that kittens will die from drinking cold milk when they're warm. However, it can potentially cause digestive issues and possibly harm them if they are already cold. To elaborate further on how to feed newborn kittens commercial milk replacer, follow these detailed steps: 1. Prepare the milk replacer: Read the instructions on the commercial milk replacer package carefully and follow them to prepare the milk. This usually involves mixing the powder with warm water, and the proportions might vary according to different products. 2. Warm the milk replacer: The milk must be warmed to a suitable temperature (around 95-100°F (35-38°C)) before feeding it to the kittens, as cold milk can be harmful to them. You can use a bottle warmer or place the bottle in a bowl of warm water until the milk reaches the desired temperature. Shake the bottle gently to ensure even heat distribution. 3. Test the kitten's temperature: As mentioned earlier, make sure the kitten is not cold before feeding. If the kitten feels cold to touch, warm it up using a heating pad, warm water bottles, or by simply holding it close to your body. Keep in mind that a kitten's body temperature should be between 95-99°F (35-37°C) to ensure safe feeding. 4. Prepare the kitten for feeding: Place the kitten on its stomach on a towel or other soft surface. This will mimic the natural nursing position and help the kitten feed comfortably. 5. Use a suitable bottle and nipple: Use a bottle specifically designed for feeding kittens or a small pet nursing bottle, with a hole in the nipple that is just big enough for a steady drip when the bottle is inverted. 6. Feed the kitten: Gently insert the bottle nipple into the kitten's mouth and allow the kitten to latch on. Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle to prevent air from entering the kitten's digestive system. Feed the kitten slowly and ensure that it is swallowing the milk. 7. Monitor the feeding amount and frequency: Newborn kittens typically need to be fed every 2-4 hours, depending on their age and size. Consult a veterinarian about the appropriate feeding schedule and amount. Maintain a feeding chart to keep track of the feedings. 8. Burp the kitten: After each feeding, gently burp the kitten by placing it against your shoulder and gently patting its back to release any trapped air in its stomach. 9. Clean the kitten: Newborn kittens require help to stimulate urination and defecation. Use a warm, wet cloth or cotton ball to gently rub the kitten's genital and anal area after each feeding. 10. Keep the kittens clean and warm: Make sure the kittens are in a clean, warm, and draft-free environment. Use a heating pad or warm water bottles to maintain a consistent temperature around the kittens. 11. Regularly visit a veterinarian: Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to ensure the kittens are growing and developing properly. The veterinarian can also provide guidance for any adjustments needed in the feeding process. Remember that while feeding newborn kittens commercial milk replacer is a viable option, a mother cat's milk is always the best and most nutritious choice. Always seek professional guidance or advice from a veterinarian for the proper care of newborn kittens."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society.

Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

A 'prime number' is a a whole number above 1 that can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: 14744 Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the problem. Now, let me determine if 14744 is a prime number or not step by step: 1. Since every prime number has only two factors (1 and the number itself), I'll check if 14744 has any factors other than these two. 2. I'll start by checking if the number is even. If it is even, then it will have 2 as a factor and won't be prime. If it's not even, then I'll check for odd factors. If there are any, then again, it won't be prime. 3. 14744 is even (since it ends in a 4), which means it is divisible by 2. Therefore, it has at least three factors: 1, 2, and 14744. As I have found that 14744 has more than two factors, I can now conclude it is not a prime number. So the output is 'No'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eric Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937) is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist. As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums). In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \\"electric\\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes. By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \\"Chest Fever\\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \\"The Genetic Method\\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \\"Rockin Chair\\", from \\"The Band\\"; the traditional \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", from \\"The Basement Tapes\\"; Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; and Bobby Charles's \\"Down South in New Orleans\\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \\"Tears of Rage\\" (from Big Pink) and \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments. Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians. After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz. What albums was he on?","completion":"According to the article, Eric Garth Hudson, as a principal member of the rock group the Band, contributed to numerous albums. These included: 1. \\"So Many Roads\\" by John Hammond, Jr where he worked as a session musician. 2. \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" with Bob Dylan, where they recorded material. 3.

Article: Nearly half of elementary and high schools in the US use the Presidential Fitness Test. It checks kids' fitness levels. Students are tested at least twice a year. In 1956, US President Eisenhower created the test, and it has been a tradition in schools since 1966. There are five activities in the test: sit-ups , push-ups , sit and reach, endurance run or walk and shuttle run . Students who get scores at or above 85 percent on all the activities can get a Presidential Physical Fitness Award. The test encourages students to live a healthy and active life. Students taking the test are really testing their limits, according to the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education. China has a similar test: the physical education(PE) test. Beginning at the age of 7, students in China are tested twice a year to check if they are healthy and strong. They also finish activities like the endurance run, sit-ups and the shuttle run. However, unlike students in the US who get awards, Chinese students get points in PE tests. The highest score is 100. For junior school students, the PE test is more important because it is worth 30 to 40 points in the entrance exam for senior high school. In order to get a good score, most students begin to prepare for the test in their junior one year.

Article: A 14-year-old British student is packing for the next day of school: textbooks, notebooks, pens, 250 grams of flour, an egg and some cooking oil. Wait, what? It's not a joke. From September, cookery will be a compulsory course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. \\"One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone. Only four out of ten of us enjoy eating meals with our children,\\" British writer Joanna Blythman wrote in her book Bad Food Britain: How A Nation Ruined Its Appetite in 2006.

Options: - learning - happiness - competition - losing - fatigue The answer is \\"losing\\" because A:","completion":"Losing is often considered the worst part of playing games for several reasons. While all the other options mentioned have their place and significance in the gaming experience, losing can cause negative emotions and impacts that overshadow their positive aspects. 1. Negative emotions: Losing in a game can trigger various negative emotions such as frustration, disappointment, anger, and sadness. While it is natural to experience some degree of emotional upheaval when losing a game, these emotions can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for those who are highly competitive or invest a significant amount of time and effort into their gaming. 2. Impact on self-esteem: Frequent losses can take a toll on a player's self-esteem and confidence. Self-doubt may set in as players start to question their abilities and skills in the game. This may hinder future performance and create a negative cycle of continued poor performance and further loss of confidence. 3. Decreased motivation: Losing can be demotivating as it may seem as though the effort put into the game has gone to waste. This can lead to a decrease in motivation to continue playing the game or engage in other similar activities, making it difficult for players to bounce back and improve their skills. 4. Competitive toxicity: Competition is an inherent part of playing games, and it can be enjoyable and motivating for many. However, losing can breed toxicity among players, with blame-shifting, negative comments, and even harassment occurring as a result. This toxic environment can further ruin the gaming experience for those already dealing with the emotional impact of losing. 5. Social implications: Losing can also have social consequences, especially in group gaming situations. Players may experience isolation or exclusion from the group due to their perceived weak performance or frequent losses. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and negatively impact their overall gaming experience and social relationships. 6. Fatigue: While fatigue is listed as a separate option, it plays a significant role in losing. When players are tired, they may not be able to perform their best in games, leading to more losses. This can result in a frustrating cycle of not being able to break away from the losing streak. While losing is a natural part of playing games, it is important for players to maintain a healthy and balanced perspective on winning and losing. This can help mitigate the negative impacts of losing and encourage personal growth and improved skills in the game. It is also important to remember that games are meant to be fun, and while competition can provide additional drive and excitement, it should not overshadow the overall enjoyment of the gaming experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages the animals to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror. The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones away from the farm, renaming it \\"Animal Farm\\". They set to work destroying every trace of the farmer's influence, mainly the weapons used against them. The people of the surrounding area rally against them, but are beaten back after a fierce fight. A subsequent investigation of the farmhouse leads them to concede against living there, though one of the head pigs, an antagonistic boar named Napoleon, takes interest in the abandoned house, and even more so in a litter of puppies left motherless. The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on a wall of the barn to illustrate their community's laws. The most important is the seventh, \\"All animals are equal.\\" All the animals work, but the workhorse, Boxer, his friend Benjamin the donkey, and the film's protagonist, put in extra work. Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge .

Question: What was the \\"stumbling block\\" that Bright mentioned? Context: The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means.

Stopping the Ebola outbreak in West Africa \\"will take a Herculean effort\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Bill Clinton's Perspective on Iraq, ISIS, and the Ebola Outbreak Former President Bill Clinton made a guest appearance on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" last Thursday, where he offered his insights on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, the fight against the terrorist group ISIS, and the global effort to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. During the interview, Clinton stated that the United States cannot win a land war in Iraq, but emphasized that the people of Iraq can, and the US should play a supportive role in their effort to reclaim their country. He highlighted the critical importance of including the Sunni Muslim population in the Iraqi government as a key strategy for defeating ISIS. \\"We can't win a land war in Iraq, but they can and we can help them,\\" Clinton said. This statement reflects the reality of the difficult political landscape in Iraq and elucidates Clinton's concern that a direct military intervention by the US would likely result in a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight. Instead, the former president argued that integrating the Sunni populace into the political fabric of Iraq would unite the various factions in the country, fostering a collaborative environment in which they can effectively push back against the extremist group. Clinton urged that the inclusion of Sunnis in the Iraqi government is essential to the long-term stability of the region and the ultimate eradication of ISIS. His position underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of the conflict, which include sectarian divisions, political marginalization, and a lack of social and economic opportunities for disenfranchised communities. By addressing these underlying issues, the Iraqi government can build a stronger foundation from which to launch an effective resistance against ISIS and rebuild their country. During his interview, the former president also underscored the necessity of a \\"Herculean effort\\" to tackle the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. This devastating disease has claimed thousands of lives and continues to spread rapidly throughout the region, posing global health and security risks. Clinton highlighted the need for a coordinated international response to combat the epidemic. He argued that only through the combined efforts of governments, non-governmental organizations, and global health agencies could we hope to contain the virus and prevent an even more catastrophic humanitarian crisis. In both the fight against ISIS and the battle to contain the Ebola outbreak, Clinton emphasized the importance of multilateral collaboration and the necessity of focusing on the root causes of these problems. The former president's appearance on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" provided valuable insight into policy approaches that prioritize long-term stability over short-term military victories and underscore the necessity for global solidarity in the face of daunting challenges. In conclusion, Bill Clinton's perspective on the current crises in Iraq and West Africa highlights the crucial importance of collaboration, inclusivity, and addressing the root causes of conflicts and epidemics rather than simply responding to their symptoms. By employing this approach, the international community can create lasting solutions and prevent the recurrence of these devastating problems. Whether it's the fight against ISIS in Iraq or the battle to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Clinton's insights serve as a reminder that only through unity, dedication, and a focus on the core issues can we hope to create a more stable, secure, and healthy world."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

For now, just go and turn on the shower. Get the water nice and warm and think about how good it would feel to climb inside. You'll probably find it much easier to shower once you're actually in the bathroom and have everything all ready to go. The hardest part often lies in simply taking the first step. Remember, the only thing holding you back is lethargy. With that out of the way, nothing can stop you. At this point, it will probably feel silly to have gone to all that trouble just to shut off the water and put your clothes back on. Since you're already in position, and it requires just as much effort to get dressed again, you might as well go ahead and hop in the shower. When you're lounging comfortably on the couch, the list of things you need to do to successfully bathe can seem overwhelming. Instead of trying to focus on lots of details at once, move things along a little at a time. If you find that you lack the motivation to shower, it can be helpful to keep in mind what happens when you don't bathe regularly. Dirt, oil and dead cells can build up on your skin, making you feel grimy and uncomfortable. If you go too long, this can cause problems like itching, clogged pores and skin infections. After a while, you can start to smell, as well, which can be a source of social embarrassment. It can be bad for you to go too long without a bath or shower. Skin conditions like acne, dermatitis and chronic body odor can develop, making you look and feel unhealthy. There's no need to shower every day. In fact, dermatologists now believe that it's actually better for you to only shower a few times a week. This may make dealing with the task easier for you.

Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Today, we are going to talk about how much money Vick paid his agent between the years 2010 and 2012. First, let's understand who these people are. Vick is a famous sports player who makes a lot of money. Just like you have a favorite superhero, many people like to watch Vick play. Now, his agent is like a helper that takes care of important things for Vick, like talking to people who want Vick to play for their teams. To thank the agent for their help, Vick gives them some money. Now, to know the exact amount Vick paid between 2010 and 2012, we would need to find specific information about their agreements. This information is usually private, which means it's a secret between Vick and his agent. But don't worry! We can still learn something from this. You see, agents often get a portion of the money that sports players earn, and this portion is called a percentage. It's a way to show their share, just like how you share your toys with your friends. Usually, the agents get around 3% to 5% of the money the players get from their team. To find out how much Vick paid his agent during that time, we need two things: 1. Vick's earnings (or how much money he got from playing) between 2010 and 2012. 2.

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

Write a sentence about the following things: curb, hydrant, top","completion":"On a typical city street, one could project a vivid urban scene where a curb, well-worn from numerous passers-by, demarcates the human realm from the well-trodden road, providing a tangible boundary that guides pedestrians and ensures their safety. This curb, a mundane yet significant component of urban architecture, subtly instructs city dwellers of their place, directing the chaotic harmony of city living elegantly. Sitting alongside it, a red fire hydrant stands sentinel, robust and bold, an unflinching symbol of hope and protection, poised to aid in extinguishing fires that may occur from unfortunate incidents or potential hazards in this teeming, busy world. Its bright shade of red serves an essential function, acting as a beacon amidst the concrete jungle, thus enabling firefighters to locate it rapidly during emergencies, mitigating potential danger and reducing harm to life and property, serving as a silent but crucial partner in maintaining the life rhythm of the city. Radiating from its height, catching the glinting sun at the brightest milliseconds of the day, a metallic top spins, its reflective surface shimmering with the mirrored images of the bustling activity around. A symbol of play, it defies the monotony of life on the street, its innocent rotation a beacon of joyful delight for children who stop to witness its rhythmic twists and turns. In the grand scheme of the city, its frivolous flamboyance forms an essential piece of the urban texture, injecting a much-needed touch of whimsy and fun into the sometimes-grey cityscape. Collectively, the curb, the hydrant, and the spinning top create a paradox of simplicity and complexity, where everyday objects collectively form a rich tapestry of urban living, each imbued with its unique narrative and role in shaping this urban symphony.

Some are thankful for what he did during his nine years in Oklahoma City, others are burning his jersey, and still others are crying and would punch him in the face. But the best video I’ve seen so far features a Thunder fan in a Durant jersey with “traitor” taped over the name, standing outside the Thunder arena holding a “Golden State?! That’s FucKD” sign, getting yelled at by a woman who thinks that Durant put Oklahoma City on the map, and a grown-ass man is allowed to make whatever decision he wants. Happy Independence Day! Advertisement h/t Samantha Vicent ||||| Kevin Durant is joining the Golden State Warriors. Saying he has experienced \\"by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life,\\" Durant announced his decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday in a post on The Players' Tribune. Editor's Picks Durant taking the easy road? Not so fast Kevin Durant might be joining a talented Warriors squad, but there's risk involved in his decision, J.A. Adande writes. Fans burn Durant's jersey after he leaves OKC Thunder fans didn't take the news of Kevin Durant's leaving Oklahoma City to join the Warriors too well. Warriors the greatest team ever with Durant? How much better are the Warriors with KD? How long is their title window? Kevin Pelton projects the NBA's new superteam, updated for the additions of David West and Zaza Pachulia. 2 Related Durant is expected to sign a two-year, 54.3 million contract, sources told ESPN's Marc Stein. The deal will include a player option after the first year. \\"The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player -- as that has always steered me in the right direction,\\" Durant wrote. \\"But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. \\"With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors.\\" After Durant signs with Golden State, two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry will be the fourth-highest-paid player on the Warriors. Durant will be No. 1, followed by Klay Thompson (16.6 million), Draymond Green (15.3 million) and Curry (12.1 million), who can become a free agent after next season. Green told The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears in a text message that he was ecstatic the Warriors landed Durant. He tweeted to express his enthusiasm about his new teammate. Welcome to THE FAMILY @KDTrey5 let's just do what we are setting out to do!! #Blockoutthenoise — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) July 4, 2016 \\"I'm excited about the opportunity to add one of the best players in the world to our team and welcome him to our brotherhood!

Warriors' odds jump with Durant After Kevin Durant's announcement that he will join Golden State, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook has moved the Warriors' odds to win next season's title from 3-2 to 4-5, making them an overwhelming favorite. The Thunder's odds dropped from 8-1 to 30-1 at the Westgate. The SuperBook also opened the Warriors' season win total for the 2016-17 campaign at 68.5. Best odds to win 2016-17 NBA championship Team Current Opened Warriors 4-5 3-2 Cavaliers 3-1 5-2 Spurs 8-1 6-1 Clippers 20-1 16-1 Celtics 20-1 20-1 Thunder 30-1 8-1 -- Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook Durant's contract can be finalized Thursday, when the leaguewide moratorium on signings and trades is lifted. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was in Hawaii and said he learned about Durant's decision to join Golden State via The Players' Tribune, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported. The Warriors plan to renounce their rights to Harrison Barnes, sources told Stein, to help clear the salary-cap space needed to sign Durant. That will make Barnes an unrestricted free agent on Thursday. Barnes, sources told Stein, remains on course to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, who reached a verbal agreement with the 24-year-old on a four-year max deal worth 94.4 million, no matter what happened with Durant. The Mavericks also have agreed to a trade with the Warriors to acquire center Andrew Bogut and his 2016-17 contract, with a base value of just over 11 million. Just before Durant's Players' Tribune post, Bogut removed references to the Warriors from his Twitter page. Golden State will renounce its rights to center Festus Ezeli, which will make him an unrestricted free agent, but guard Shaun Livingston was told by the Warriors that he won't be traded, sources told Spears. Golden State also agreed to a one-year, 2.9 million deal with Zaza Pachulia, according to a report by The Vertical. Thunder general manager Sam Presti expressed his team's disappointment over Durant's departure in a statement. \\"Kevin made an indelible mark on the Thunder organization and the state of Oklahoma as a founding father of this franchise,\\" Presti said. \\"We can't adequately articulate what he meant to the foundation of this franchise and our success. While clearly disappointing that he has chosen to move on, the core values that he helped establish only lead to us thanking him for the many tangible and intangible ways that he helped our program.\\" Presti later said the team had a pretty good idea that Durant was moving on even before its final meeting with him in the Hamptons on Sunday. \\"Even when we were relatively sure it probably wasn't going to go our way, eight staff members and our owner stayed overnight in New York just to be there and to kind of finish it out,\\" Presti said at a news conference in Oklahoma City on Monday evening. \\"We've been there for every first in his career, and we wanted to finish it out the right way by being present whenever that decision was made, regardless of how it turned out.\\" Presti said he was alerted to Durant's final choice in a phone call from Durant on Monday morning a few minutes before the announcement. \\"It was disappointing, it was hurtful; but at the end of the day, it was what he felt was best for him,\\" Presti said. The Thunder will take some time before making any roster decisions, particularly related to All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook's future, sources told ESPN's Brian Windhorst. The biggest catch on the free-agent market, Durant met with six teams over the past three days: Oklahoma City, Golden State, San Antonio, Boston, Miami and the Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors held their meeting with Durant on Friday. On Saturday, Durant spoke with NBA legend Jerry West, a member of the Warriors' executive board, on the phone, sources told ESPN's Chris Broussard. West outlined the reasons he thought Golden State would be the ideal fit for the superstar forward. Kevin Durant is joining the Warriors after his Thunder took Golden State to the brink of elimination in the Western Conference finals last season. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Durant, 27, has spent all nine seasons of his career with the Thunder organization. He won the MVP in 2014, has been named first-­team All-­NBA five times and has made seven All-­Star teams. He has appeared in four Western Conference finals and one NBA Finals, in which he lost in five games to the Heat in 2012. \\"I'm from Washington D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me,\\" Durant wrote. \\"It taught me so much about family, as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. \\"It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career.\\" Durant bounced back last season to earn second­-team All-NBA honors after undergoing three surgeries to repair a Jones fracture on his right foot suffered before the 2014-­15 season, in which he was limited to 27 games before undergoing a season-­ending bone graft procedure in March. Without Durant, the Thunder missed the postseason. With Durant back for 72 games last season, the Thunder improved to 55-27 and finished third in the West. The Thunder beat the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the opening round, upset the 67-­win Spurs in six games in the second round and pushed the Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals. Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists last season, and he scored at least 20 points in 67 straight games. In nine seasons, Durant has averaged 27.4 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. Golden State set an NBA regular-season record with 73 wins and led the league in scoring last season, but the Warriors fell just short of a repeat NBA title and lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. ESPN staff writer Royce Young and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| This has been by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life. I understood cognitively that I was facing a crossroads in my evolution as a player and as a man, and that it came with exceptionally difficult choices. What I didn’t truly understand, however, was the range of emotions I would feel during this process. The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player — as that has always steered me in the right direction. But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors. I’m from Washington, D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me. It taught me so much about family as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career. I will miss Oklahoma City, and the role I have had in building this remarkable team. I will forever cherish the relationships within the organization — the friends and teammates that I went to war with on the court for nine years, and all the fans and people of the community. They have always had my back unconditionally, and I cannot be more grateful for what they have meant to my family and to me. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick examines Durant's decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder to join Golden State. usa today sports Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30, right) is congratulated by Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant (35) after Game 7 of the Western conference finals. Durant has decided if he can't beat the Warriors, to join them. (Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) The balance of power in the NBA remained in the Western Conference with Kevin Durant’s stunning decision to play for the Golden State Warriors. But within the West, the scale has swung – almost impossibly so for a 73-win team with three All-Stars – even more in the Warriors’ favor for the 2016-17 season and beyond. By adding Durant, one of the league’s best players and former MVP, to a roster with two-time MVP Steph Curry and All-NBA players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, the Warriors are heavy favorites to win the championship next year after losing a dramatic seven-game Finals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers in June. While some teams improved in the East, not one has improved enough to surpass the Cavs as the favorites to win the conference title season. There is a strong possibility the Warriors and Cavs will play in the Finals for a third consecutive time – something no two teams have done, not even the Boston Celtics-Los Angeles Lakers of the 1960s and 1980s. San Antonio, which finished with a franchise-best 67 victories last season, fell further behind the Warriors with Durant’s decision. Oklahoma City, which had a 3-1 lead on Golden State in the conference finals in May, just lost its star, and now has to ponder a long-term plan that might not include Russell Westbrook, who is a free agent next summer. The Los Angeles Clippers maintained the status quo. The Warriors can dominate in the West. It’s a dynasty in the making. That doesn’t mean they will try to break their record of 73 regular-season victories. In fact, expect Golden State to take a more deliberate approach to the regular season, pacing itself for the two-month playoff run. Now, the Warriors have work to do on the court. Incorporating four All-Stars into the lineup won’t be easy, especially on the offensive end. But that’s why Warriors coach Steve Kerr – as he has said before – is paid so well. It’s up to him and his coaching staff to get buy-in from those stars to play a certain way, to sacrifice for the good of the team. But on the surface, that roster creates so many problems for opposing defenses. Don’t think for a second Durant’s decision to leave small-market Oklahoma City for big-market Golden State sits well with the rest of the league. The 2011 lockout, in part, sought to create better opportunities for small-market teams to compete. The league instituted tougher restrictions in the collective bargaining agreement, including harsher financial penalties for team spending above the luxury tax line. As recently as June 2 just before Game 1 of the Finals, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “Creating a system that allows every team I’d say the equality — an equal opportunity to compete for championships. I think we’re never going to have NFL-style parity in this league. It is the nature of this league that certain players are so good that those teams are likely almost automatically if that player remains healthy to become playoff teams and especially mixed with other great players.” But the influx of TV money gave teams that otherwise would not have had the financial flexibility to add a maximum-salary player the freedom to do just that. Remember all that angst in 2010 about creating super teams after LeBron James joined the Miami Heat alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh? Well, the Warriors just created the super team of all super teams in this era of the NBA. Thunder general manager Sam Presti can’t be happy about the league’s inability to prevent a move like this from happening. Silver knew the unprecedented rise in the salary cap, from 70 million in 2015-16 to 94 million in 2016-17, would create unintended circumstances. At the 2016 All-Star Game Silver said, \\"As I’ve said before, a dramatic increase in the cap, as we’re going to see next year, is not something we modeled when we designed this collective bargaining agreement. We'd prefer a system where teams are managing for cap room, and we'd prefer a system in which stars are distributed throughout the league as opposed to congregating in one market.\\" Five years ago, NBA owners and front-office executives were not envisioning a scenario in which a team with three All-Stars could add a fourth. But that’s what just happened, and 29 other teams, including the champion Cavs, are wondering how they’re going to beat Golden State in a seven-game series. |||||","completion":"NBA star, Kevin Durant, has announced he will be leaving Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors.

As it stands, the statement is unfinished, and the sentiment appears to be ambiguous. The term \\"modestly made\\" suggests that the movie has a modest budget, a limited scope, or a simplistic approach. This expression could hold either a positive or negative sentiment, depending on the movie's genre and the expectations of the reviewer. For instance, a viewer may appreciate a modestly made film due to its simplicity or focus on storytelling over visual effects. On the other hand, the same term could be used as a critique if the movie lacked a level of refinement or extravagance expected by the audience. However, the presence of the word \\"but\\" implies a contrast or contradiction in the reviewer's opinion. It suggests that the reviewer has more to say about the film, which may alter or clarify the sentiment expressed in the initial part of the sentence. This additional context is crucial in establishing a more accurate assessment of the reviewer's sentiment.

Context: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them. Question: what I responded to mrs D Options: A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill B.

It's impossible to say. While it is true that Hipmunk received increased media attention after Google announced its flight search service in September 2011, there isn't enough information provided to conclusively determine if Hipmunk's media attention was still quite low despite the increase. Several factors can affect media attention, such as marketing efforts, competition within the online travel industry, and the changing landscape of technology. To make a more accurate assessment of Hipmunk's media attention, we would need to analyze data about its coverage in various media outlets, comparative growth trends, and its performance against competitors during that period. Additionally, \\"quite low\\" is a relative term, and to properly evaluate whether Hipmunk's media attention was still relatively low, we would need to establish a baseline or reference point for comparison. For example, comparing Hipmunk's media attention to a well-established online travel company or an industry average would help provide a better understanding of the level of Hipmunk's media presence during that time.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What three features of religious archiecture are mentioned in the paragraph?\\" Context: \\"Few large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century, although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries. By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture. One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, or the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church, usually at the west end of the building.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The paragraph mentions three distinct features of religious architecture: 1. Transept: This is described as the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. In religious architecture, the transept serves as a distinct space within the church for various liturgical functions and often houses chapels, altars, and other elements relevant to the worship space. The mention of the transept showcases the influence of the cross shape on the design of these religious structures. 2. Crossing Tower: This is another feature of religious architecture that emerged during the period described in the paragraph. The crossing tower usually rises above the point where the transept and nave intersect, creating a focal point and an opportunity for vertical emphasis in the church's design. This element can serve various purposes, such as housing the church's bells or providing an inspiring visual symbol of the religious institution. 3. Monumental Entrance: The final feature mentioned is the monumental entrance to the church, typically located at the west end of the building. This element highlights the significance and grandeur of the religious structure, as it creates an impressive first impression for the worshippers and visitors entering the church. The monumental entrance could consist of intricately carved doors, ornate sculptures, or large-scale architectural elements framing the entrance, all aimed at elevating the overall experience of entering the sacred space. These three features – the transept, crossing tower, and monumental entrance – demonstrate the innovations in, and the importance of, religious architecture during the period between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the Carolingian Empire in the 8th century. The mention of these elements offers insight into the architectural evolution of religious spaces and their impact on societal and artistic values of the time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number.

Please answer the following question: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

PUBLISHED:. 07:40 EST, 17 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:55 EST, 17 May 2013. A grieving husband has been accused of assaulting a traffic warden who tried to ticket cars outside his home while he waited for his wife's funeral cortege. Angry relatives confronted the warden as he was allegedly preparing to issue them fines while they waited for the hearse carrying the body of cancer victim Rena Page, 64. Her stunned husband Mac Page, 66, challenged the official who later reported him to the police for assault. Stunned: Matthew Page, 39, with wife Kerrie outside his family's home where a traffic warden tried to issue tickets as they waited for his mother's funeral cortege. His father is accused of assaulting the warden. Four cars were briefly parked on a. single yellow line outside Mr Page's home in Hunstanton, Norfolk, as. the funeral cars moved into position. The family confronted the official who allegedly carried on noting the cars' details. A funeral director is also reported to have tried to intervene. Angry family members admit they challenged the warden but were stunned to later learn he had reported widower Mr Page for assault. Mr Page, a self-employed gardener, said yesterday: 'I can’t describe how I felt really. It was bad enough to bury someone at 64 after 48 years of marriage. This bloke didn’t show any compassion at all. Mourned: Relatives of Rena Page, 64, who died of cancer, have accused the warden of behaving heartlessly. 'If it was the middle of the season and there were lots of cars about, I could at least understand it a little bit, but he was just being a jobsworth. The last three years - watching my wife die of cancer - have been quite horrendous, now we have this to deal with on top. 'What I couldn’t believe is that when we rang to complain, his boss backed him up. How can anyone in authority back somebody like that up? It beggars belief.' Mr Page said he was happy to appear in court to give his version of events. His son Matthew Page, 39, who runs a chip shop, added: 'There was just a total lack of respect - and they wonder why they get a bad name. The worst thing was Mum never liked a fuss. This turned it all into a debacle. I cannot believe someone could be so insensitive.' Funeral director John Lincoln, who was leading the cortege, said: 'I have never known anything like this before. He might lose someone one day and I wonder how he would react if this sort of thing happened to him.' A West Norfolk Council spokesman confirmed discretion exists within its parking rules for occasions such as funerals, but refused to apologise until the outcome of the police investigation into the assault was known. The spokesman said: 'Following the incident referred to, a member of our staff reported an assault and the matter is now with the police. We await the outcome of any subsequent investigations.' The spokesman said no tickets were issued during the incident but that vehicles attending a funeral, 'are not exempt from parking rules. When we are made aware of a funeral, we work to accommodate the hearse and funeral cortege respectfully,' he added.Father-of-two Matthew Page has lodged an official complaint with the council. A spokesman for Norfolk police confirmed the force was investigating a reported assault. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? Joe likes his bar, and Sally's patrons do too. Choices: A). unacceptable B). acceptable","completion":"B). acceptable The given sentence, \\"Joe likes his bar, and Sally's patrons do too,\\" can be considered acceptable by the strictest standards when examined by a linguist. Here is a detailed explanation of why this sentence falls within the realm of grammatical acceptability. Firstly, let's break down the sentence to understand its structure and components: 1. \\"Joe likes his bar\\" is the independent clause, which can stand alone as a complete thought. It has a clear subject (Joe), a verb (likes), and an object (his bar). Moreover, the use of a possessive pronoun 'his' indicates the ownership of the bar by Joe. 2. The coordinating conjunction \\"and\\" is employed to connect the independent clause to the second part of the sentence. The use of \\"and\\" indicates that the two clauses will be related in some manner. 3. \\"Sally's patrons\\" serves as the subject of the second part of the sentence. Here, the use of the possessive noun form (\\"Sally's\\") accurately signifies that the patrons belong to or are associated with Sally. 4. \\"do too\\" acts as a verb phrase in the latter part of the sentence, with the auxiliary verb \\"do\\" serving to avoid repetition of the main verb \\"like\\" from the first clause. The adverb \\"too\\" establishes agreement or similarity with the action described earlier in the sentence and ensures the second part is connected in meaning to the first part. Thus, the sentence maintains a cohesive meaning and adheres to grammatical standards.

Internet Explorer is a way to look at and play with things on the internet, like watching videos or playing games. But sometimes, just like your toys, it can have a problem called a \\"bug\\". A bug is like a tiny mistake or problem in the way the computer program works. When there's a bug, things can go wrong or not work properly. The big company that made Internet Explorer, called Microsoft, found out that there was a bug in their program.

Now, Microsoft has come up with a special helping tool called a \\"temporary fix\\" for this bug. A temporary fix is like when your parents fix your toy quickly just so you can have fun now, but they still need to fix it properly later.

They both share a unique bond - being drawn together despite Edward being a nearly immortal vampire. Bella, a normal human teenager, has always displayed reluctance towards the idea of marriage, despite her love for Edward. Haunted by her parents' tumultuous marriage and eventual divorce, she believes that the institution might be a recipe for disaster. However, there's a twist to their love story; in order for them to be together for eternity, Bella must become a vampire. Edward, a centuries-old vampire, can't bear the thought of turning Bella into a creature of the night, knowing it will strip away her humanity. As they dance around the issue, their love grows stronger, and Bella becomes more drawn to the idea of sharing eternity with Edward. One day, a new threat emerges - a ruthless vampire hunter named Victor who has set his sights on killing Edward and his family, the Cullens. Bella, realizing the real danger her loved ones are in, starts to reconsider her priorities. The story takes a turn when, during a fierce confrontation with Victor, Bella is gravely injured and the vampire hunter exposes the hidden world of vampires to the general public. Now, the Cullen family - along with the town of Forks - must navigate this new reality where humans and vampires are forced to confront each other. With time running out and Victor still at large, Bella comes to a life-altering decision – she wants to join Edward and his family in their fight against Victor, and in order to do that, she must become one of them. Recognizing Edward's desire to protect her, she confronts him with her decision and they both decide to get married, as a symbol of their commitment to one another and their shared fight against evil. The wedding ceremony is bittersweet, as they know threads of their old life must be cut away - but the love between them is enough to give them strength. After converting to a vampire in the presence of her family, Bella and the Cullens join forces to defeat Victor and protect the humans and vampires alike. In the end, with Victor defeated, Bella and Edward find solace in their eternal life together. Through their powerful love story, the citizens of Forks come to accept the existence of vampires and begin to embrace a new, more harmonious world where humans and vampires peacefully coexist.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - suppose plants die in soft mud more often happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"- indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the given situation, if plants die in soft mud more often, it would initially appear as though it could lead to more fossil formation as more organic material is available. However, considering other factors, it might actually lead to less fossil formation, thus indirectly impacting the aforementioned process. Here's why: Fossil formation is a fairly rare event as it requires specific conditions. Not all plants that perish will become fossils, most will decompose before fossilization can occur. If more plants are dying and decomposing in the same location (the soft mud), it could potentially accelerate the rate of decomposition due to potentially increasing activities of decomposing organisms. This could thus decrease the chances of fossils forming, as decomposition might occur faster than the rate of sedimentation and mineralization required for fossil formation. In addition, an increase in dying plants could alter the environment in ways that may not be favorable for fossil formation. For instance, the decomposition process could lead to a lowering of oxygen levels or alteration of the soil’s acidity, which might affect the fossilization process. Therefore, whilst the increasing rate of plants dying in the mud doesn't directly alter a step in the fossil formation process, it could indirectly impact it by changing the conditions required for fossilization to occur, and thus can lead to fewer fossils being formed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The manager throws them away before anyone can get them .;","completion":"[C]. The place is very popular and the caneles get sold out quick. There could be several reasons for the canelles being sold out at Canto 6 bakery when you go there, but the most plausible explanation is that the place is very popular, and the caneles get sold out quickly. This could be due to a combination of factors such as: 1. High demand: Caneles might be one of the most sought-after items at Canto 6 bakery, with people looking forward to savoring them. This results in a high demand for the product, causing them to sell out quickly. 2. Limited production: It's possible that the bakery produces a limited quantity of canelles each day to ensure their freshness and quality. If the production doesn't meet the demand, they will sell out faster. 3. Reputation: If Canto 6 has a stellar reputation for its canelles, it could attract a significant number of customers who specifically visit the bakery for this delicacy. Their fame would contribute to a rapid depletion of inventory. 4. Time of day: Since canelles are typically a breakfast or brunch item, they might sell out earlier in the day. By the time you visit the bakery, the majority of them may have already been purchased by other customers. 5. Regular customers: The bakery might have regular customers who always buy a specific amount of canelles, either to enjoy themselves or to sell at their own establishments. These customers could contribute to the quick sellout of the product. In conclusion, it is most likely that the popularity of the bakery and the high demand for their canelles cause them to sell out rapidly. To increase your chances of getting one, it might be a good idea to go earlier in the day and check if they have a specific time for preparing the canelles, so you can be there right when they're being freshly made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate \\"The signature in Lisbon tomorrow will underline the commitment of all signatories to achieving ratification of the Treaty.\\" to Finnish?","completion":"\\"Allekirjoitus Lissabonissa huomenna korostaa kaikkien allekirjoittajien sitoutumista sopimuksen ratifioinnin saavuttamiseen.\\" In this translation, the sentence structure and word order have been preserved as close to the original English sentence as possible, while still maintaining the natural flow of the Finnish language. Here is a breakdown of the translation, word by word: - The signature = Allekirjoitus - in Lisbon = Lissabonissa - tomorrow = huomenna - will underline = korostaa (the Finnish word for \\"underline\\" is used in the same way as in English, meaning \\"to emphasize\\" in this context) - the commitment = sitoutumista (this is the partitive form of the noun 'sitoutuminen', meaning commitment in Finnish) - of all = kaikkien (an adjective that agrees with the following plural noun) - signatories = allekirjoittajien (a plural possessive form of the noun 'allekirjoittaja', signatory in Finnish) - to achieving = saavuttamiseen (this is the illative form of the noun 'saavuttaminen', which is derived from the verb 'saavuttaa', to achieve in Finnish) - ratification = ratifioinnin (the singular possessive form of the noun 'ratifiointi', ratification in Finnish) - of the Treaty = sopimuksen (the singular possessive form of the noun 'sopimus', treaty in Finnish). Thus, the translation might be more literally understood as: “The signature in Lisbon tomorrow emphasizes the commitment of all signatories to the achievement of the ratification of the Treaty.” This is stylistically different from the English sentence, but preserves the meaning and flows well in Finnish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They come in many colors and designs, so you can choose your favorite one. Now, let's move on to the special T-shirt. This one has a black color, just like the night sky, and a white collar, which is the part that wraps around our neck. Collars can be soft and comfy and help keep our necks warm too. Not to forget, our T-shirt has short sleeves, meaning it covers only a small part of our arms. This is perfect for when the sun is shining outside, but it's not too hot. How to wear our jacket and T-shirt: 1. Pick out your favorite jacket and the black T-shirt with a white collar from your closet. 2. Put on the black T-shirt first. Make sure the white collar is around your neck and the short sleeves are on your arms. You might need some help from a grown-up to make sure it fits just right. 3. Next, put on your jacket. Slide your arms through the sleeves, just like you're giving your jacket a big hug. Ask a grown-up to help you zip or button up your jacket if you need help. 4. Make sure everything feels nice and comfy. If you feel too hot or too cold, you can always change your clothes. 5. Finally, look in the mirror and give yourself a big smile. You did it! You're looking fantastic in your cool jacket and black T-shirt with a white collar. So, little friends, now you know how to wear a jacket and a black T-shirt with a white collar and short sleeves.

Hypothesis: Two toddlers who want to be doctors when they grow up. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, we cannot directly conclude the hypothesis that the two toddlers want to be doctors when they grow up based on the premise you've provided. The premise states that the two toddlers, a boy and a girl, are engaging in a very common mode of play for kids their age - pretend play. They are using plastic doctor toys and giving an adult a make-believe medical examination. These activities can naturally invoke a great deal of amusement and joy for toddlers as it helps them to mimic adult roles and routines, explore social roles, and understand social norms and conventions. Furthermore, using doctor toys can teach children about empathy, nurturing and caring for others who are 'sick' or 'in discomfort.' However, this behavior does not inherently suggest a future career aspiration. Toddlers are generally not capable of long-term planning or thinking about their futures in a concrete way. They play pretend for a variety of reasons, such as entertainment, curiosity, an opportunity to feel empowered or in control, or mimicking scenes that they've seen in real life or in the media. They might play doctor one day, and then play chef, firefighter, astronaut, or superhero the next. While the toddlers are showing an interest in the activity at this point in time, it would be a leap to conclude that this play indicates concrete future career aspirations. They are, at this stage, more likely just exploring and mimicking the world around them, a common and important part of early childhood development. Overall, while we can say that the toddlers are engaged in imaginative play involving medical examinations, it's just as likely that they're simply copying what they've seen adults do, or recreating situations they've seen on TV, or even just using whatever toys were available at the time. To conclude that they want to be doctors based purely on this instance of play would be speculative without additional supporting information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Especially if you're self-financing your small farm business, you may think a formal business plan isn't necessary. However, a formal business plan can help you start to think of your farm as a business and treat it seriously. Rely on your market research to come up with profitability predictions. Keep in mind it typically takes small farms several years to get off the ground. If you plan on running your farm as a side-business or a hobby farm, a business plan can still help you organize the finances for your farm and keep it from taking over your personal funds. Once you've finished your business plan, have a business startup or financial advisor critique it and offer suggestions to improve. Look for someone who has extensive experience working with successful small farm businesses. Check with a government farm services office or a regional farm group if you're having a hard time finding a good advisor. Staff at any of those locations typically can provide a strong local recommendation or two. When you're starting out, you have the choice to run your small farm business as a sole proprietorship, an LLC, or a corporation. The form you choose depends on your business goals and the level of personal risk you want to assume. If you organize your business as a sole proprietorship, your farm is not separate from you and your personal finances in any way. This may be the easiest option if you're just running your farm as a side-business and have a full-time job. A corporation gives you the most personal protection, but also is the most expensive and time-consuming form. You can incorporate at any time, so wait until your farm starts turning a profit. An LLC, or limited liability company, provides all of the benefits of a corporation and a sole proprietorship with none of the downsides of either. Choose this form if your goal is to make your living from your farm someday. Even if you don't hire any employees (although you probably will), you will need a separate tax ID number for your farm business so you can pay taxes on farm income. If you're in the U.S., you can get an employer identification number (EIN) fairly easily. Simply answer a few questions about your business and you can get your EIN immediately. Write it down or print it out and keep it in a safe place. You may need a separate tax ID number for state or local taxes as well. If you haven't already made friends with staff at your nearest farm services office, now is the time to do so. Schedule an appointment to register your farm so you can take advantage of any government subsidies or benefits. Bring property documents along with proof of personal identity and business organization documents. Once you're registered, make sure you report any changes in the ownership or organization of your business as soon as possible, and keep your contact information up to date. You may be required to file regular acreage reports and other documentation. Depending on the crops or livestock you're raising, the state or local government may require regular inspections and licensing of your farm operations. For example, if you're selling crops to the public, you may need a license certifying that your storage facilities meet local health code requirements. Your local town or county government office is one way to find out what licenses are needed. You can also talk to neighboring farmers and find out from them what you'll need. Your state university agricultural extension program typically has specific information and resources to help you handle any licenses or permits you need at either the local or state level. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses the importance of a formal business plan for small farm businesses, indicating that it allows for serious organization, treatment of the farm as a business, and financial control. It suggests seeking profitability predictions from a market research and having a startup advisor to proofread the business plan.

Based on the sentence \\"A woman carrying a bag with a little girl in a pink dress walking behind her and a man in a blue shirt walking towards her.\\", is the sentence \\"A group of people are walking.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A group of people are walking.\\" is a true sentence based on the original description. In the original sentence, there are three individuals involved: 1. A woman carrying a bag 2. A little girl in a pink dress walking behind the woman 3. A man in a blue shirt walking towards the woman. The original sentence describes a scenario where these people are engaged in walking, although they may be walking in different directions. By describing this as \\"a group of people are walking,\\" the sentence accurately captures the action of walking being performed by multiple individuals (in this case, three people). However, one should note that the term \\"group\\" could have different interpretations, and one might argue that since the man is walking towards the woman and girl, they might not necessarily be perceived as a cohesive unit or group. Despite this potential ambiguity, the sentence still remains true in its broadest interpretation of a group of people taking part in the action of walking. In summary, based on the original sentence, the statement \\"A group of people are walking\\" is indeed a true sentence as it accurately generalizes the actions of the individuals involved. However, it is important to note that the term \\"group\\" can have varying interpretations and may not fully capture the detailed dynamics and directions described in the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The body of a boy was found Friday afternoon near the wreckage of a plane crash in Lake Wales, Florida, raising the final death toll to six, officials said. The plane, which was carrying a husband, wife and their four children, went down Thursday. The other bodies had already been recovered. \\"We can tell you that none are now unaccounted for,\\" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. \\"It's just a tragic event of monumental proportion, but we're pleased that we're at least reuniting the entire family.\\" The last victim to be found was in thick underbrush about half a mile southwest of the main wreckage, Judd said. The flight originated at Treasure Cay Airport in the Bahamas and landed at St. Lucie County Airport at 10:15 a.m. Thursday to clear customs. The plane left St. Lucie just after noon, and the first 911 call came in at 12:36 p.m., said Judd. Its final destination was Junction City, Kansas. The plane began to break apart and crashed, going down in a remote, palmetto-covered stretch near Lake-Walk-In-The-Water that is not easily accessible, officials said. Rescuers and investigators used all-terrain vehicles to get to the scene. Plane parts were reported as far as four miles away. The cause of the crash is not clear but is under investigation, said Tim Monville, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. \\"We have parts structurally separated. I don't know what that means yet. We'll have to investigate. That's what we're here for,\\" he said. The Polk County Sheriff's Office identified the family as Ronald Bramlage, 45; his wife, Rebecca Bramlage, 43; and their children, Brandon, 15; Boston, 13; Beau, 11; and Roxanne, 8. Boston was believed to be the last one found. The plane is a Pilatus PC-12/47 owned by Roadside Ventures LLC of Junction City. The Bramlage family is well-known in the Kansas State University community.

It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Tak'alik Ab'aj"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Bertie returns to London from several weeks in Cannes spent in the company of his Aunt Dahlia Travers and her daughter Angela. In Bertie's absence, Jeeves has been advising Bertie's old school friend, Gussie Fink-Nottle, who is in love with a goofy, sentimental, whimsical, childish girl named Madeline Bassett. Gussie, a shy teetotaler with a passion for newts and a face like a fish, is too timid to speak to her. Bertie is annoyed that his friends consider Jeeves more intelligent than Bertie, and he takes Gussie's case in hand, ordering Jeeves not to offer any more advice. Madeline, a friend of Bertie's cousin Angela, is staying at Brinkley Court (country seat of Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom). Aunt Dahlia demands that Bertie come to Brinkley Court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school, which he considers a fearsome task. Bertie sends Gussie to Brinkley Court in his place, so that Gussie will have the chance to woo Madeline there, but also so that Gussie will be forced to take on the unpleasant job of distributing the school prizes. When Angela breaks her engagement to the athletic but heavy Tuppy Glossop, Bertie feels obliged to go down to Brinkley Court to comfort Aunt Dahlia. In addition to her worry about Angela's broken engagement, Aunt Dahlia is anxious because she has lost 500 pounds gambling at Cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband Tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine, Milady's Boudoir. Bertie advises her to arouse Uncle Tom's concern for her by pretending to have lost her appetite through worry. He offers similar advice to Tuppy, to win back Angela. He also offers the same advice to Gussie, to show his love for Madeline. All take his advice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food upsets Aunt Dahlia's temperamental prized chef Anatole, who gives notice to quit. Not unreasonably, Aunt Dahlia blames Bertie for this disaster. When Bertie attempts to probe Madeline's feelings about Gussie, she misinterprets his questioning as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose, and Bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with liquor. Gussie ends up imbibing more liquor than Bertie had intended. Under its influence, Gussie successfully proposes to Madeline. He then delivers a hilarious, abusive, drunken speech to the grammar school while presenting the school prizes. Madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement and resolves to marry Bertie instead. The prospect of spending his life with the drippy Madeline terrifies Bertie, but his personal code of chivalrous behavior will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his \\"proposal\\" and turning her down. Meanwhile, Gussie, still drunk, retaliates against Madeline by proposing to Angela, who accepts him in order to score off Tuppy. Tuppy's jealousy is aroused and he chases Gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life. In the face of this chaos, Bertie admits his inability to cope, and appeals to Jeeves for advice. Jeeves arranges for Bertie to be absent for a few hours, and during that time swiftly and ingeniously solves all the problems, assuring that Angela and Tuppy are reconciled, that Gussie and Madeline become engaged again, that Anatole withdraws his resignation, and that Uncle Tom writes Aunt Dahlia a check for 500 pounds. Bertie learns his lesson and resolves to let Jeeves have his way in the future. Sections of the story were adapted into episodes of the ITV series Jeeves and Wooster.

Why was Donald Trump talking about the abortion issue? What will be the angle between electric field, magnetic field and direction of propagation of an EM wave while bending due to gravity (near a black hole)? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Question 1: Donald Trump was talking about the abortion issue because it's a big topic that many people have strong feelings about. Some people believe that women should have the choice to end a pregnancy, while others think it's wrong. As a president, he had to share his opinions on this issue, so people would know what he believed and how he might make decisions about it. Question 2: When an electromagnetic (EM) wave gets close to a black hole, the gravity from the black hole can make it bend. You see, EM waves are made up of electric and magnetic fields that wiggle together. In regular cases (far from any black holes), the electric field, magnetic field, and direction the wave travels are all perpendicular (at right angles) to each other.

Information: - Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology. Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\". - A mother is the female parent of a child. Mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children, who may or may not be their biological offspring. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth, by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilisation, or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the third a surrogacy mother. - A paternal bond refers to the relationship between a father and his child . In the U.S. , legal paternity is presumed for the husband of the mother unless a separate action is taken ; an unmarried man may establish paternity by signing a voluntary recognition of paternity or by taking court action . Paternity may also be established between a man and a younger person , commonly in adoption , without the two being biologically related . - Sperm donation is the provision (or \\"donation\\") by a male (known as a sperm donor) of his sperm (known as donor sperm), principally for the purpose of inseminating a female who is not his sexual partner. - Sexual intercourse, or coitus or copulation, is principally the insertion and thrusting of the penis, usually when erect, into the vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both. This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers), and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo). These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more individuals and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure and commonly contribute to human bonding. - Inheritance is the practice of passing on property, titles, debts, rights, and obligations upon the death of an individual. The rules of inheritance differ between societies and have changed over time. - Biologically, a child (plural: children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty. The legal definition of \\"child\\" generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority. - A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental legal and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations, although this varies between jurisdictions. An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the baby, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child. - A male () organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm. Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete, or ovum, in the process of fertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs. - Parenting or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, financial, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood. Parenting refers to the aspects of raising a child aside from the biological relationship. - Filiation is the legal term that refers to the recognized legal status of the relationship between family members, or more specifically the legal relationship between parent and child. As described by the Government of Quebec: - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm. - Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents. Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations. What entity does 'paternal bond' has the relation 'subclass of' with?

These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.\\".

Short movie review: two bodies and hardly a laugh between them Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review, \\"Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them,\\" it appears that the critic is thinking negatively of the movie. This statement implies that the film involved two main characters (the \\"two bodies\\"), and there were very few laughs or humorous moments throughout the movie. The phrasing of \\"hardly a laugh between them\\" likely indicates dissatisfaction with the film, as the critic is emphasizing the lack of humor or engaging moments. Additionally, using the phrase \\"between them\\" can suggest that the chemistry between the two main actors might have been lacking, resulting in limited comedic timing or poor delivery of jokes. The critic may also be disappointed in the film's overall potential for providing a humorous or engaging narrative. Such criticism might indicate that the movie's genre was intended to be a comedy or a lighthearted film. However, the critic's negative perception suggests that it failed to deliver that kind of entertainment. Thus, the movie might have fallen short of its intended appeal. In conclusion, the critic seems to have a negative perception of the movie, expressing disappointment in the limited number of laughs and possibly the lack of chemistry between the two main characters. The film might not have met its intended comedic or entertaining objectives, resulting in the critic's negative review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"The world's deepest lake is Lake Baikal, located in Siberia, Russia. It is an ancient and massive freshwater lake that holds the record for being the deepest and the largest in terms of volume, containing about 20% of the world's unfrozen freshwater. Lake Baikal has a maximum depth of approximately 1,642 meters (5,387 feet) and an average depth of 744.4 meters (2,442 feet). The lake is also considered one of the world's oldest lakes, with an estimated age of 25-30 million years. Baikal's water is remarkably clear because it is inhabited by epischura baikalensis, a small crustacean that helps to clean the water by consuming and filtering the impurities. The lake is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals, two-thirds of which can be found nowhere else in the world. This unique biodiversity has earned the region a place on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The general shape of Lake Baikal is a crescent, stretching approximately 636 kilometers (395 miles) long from northeast to southwest. Its maximum width is about 79 kilometers (49 miles) and the average width is around 48 kilometers (30 miles). The lake's vast waters are spread across 31,722 square kilometers (12,248 square miles), making it the seventh-largest lake in the world by surface area. Lake Baikal is fed by a total of 336 tributary rivers and streams, which supply water to the lake. The most notable of these tributaries is the Selenga River, which contributes more than half of the total inflow to Lake Baikal. Despite the numerous tributaries going in, there is only one outlet from the lake – the Angara River, which flows out of the lake and eventually joins the Yenisey River. The lake's fascinating geological history, rich biodiversity, and impressive depth make Lake Baikal a popular destination for tourists, scientists, and nature enthusiasts. Visitors can enjoy exploring the numerous hiking trails and pristine wilderness around the lake, as well as taking part in various adventure sports, such as diving, swimming, and wildlife observation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
