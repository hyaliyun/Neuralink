Given the question: Question: \\"What are two issues with a wide groove?\\" Context: \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"There are two primary issues with a wide groove in the context of vinyl records and their manufacturing limitations: 1. Reduced playing time: A wide groove requires the stylus of the record player to swing a longer distance from side to side in order to accurately reproduce the low frequencies. This results in the groove taking up more space on the vinyl record, thereby limiting the amount of playing time available for the recorded music. As record manufacturers and consumers generally prefer maximizing the amount of music that can fit on a single record, having a wide groove can be seen as a disadvantage. 2. Higher noise levels at high frequencies: As the groove width increases, so does the potential for unwanted noise in the form of hiss, pops, and ticks. This issue is particularly prominent at high frequencies, where noise can become significant and negatively impact the listening experience. To address this problem, equalization can be used to conform to an agreed-upon standard. During recording, the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, which in turn reduces the required groove width. Simultaneously, the amplitude of high frequencies is increased. When the record is played back, the playback equipment boosts the bass and reduces the treble to restore the original tonal balance within the signal. This process not only allows for more music to be recorded on the record but also helps in reducing the high-frequency noise associated with wide grooves. In summary, the two main issues with a wide groove are its impact on reducing the playing time of a record and the increased noise levels at high frequencies. By using equalization techniques, these problems can be mitigated, enabling more music to fit on a record and improving the overall listening experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\", is \\"turn on loud music\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\" cannot be determined with absolute certainty, as individual preferences and actions may vary. However, we can make a reasonable assumption from the context provided. Since Alex has just put Tracy to bed, it can be assumed that Tracy might be a child or someone who requires rest. In such a situation, playing loud music may not be an optimal choice, as it would disturb Tracy's sleep or rest. Thus, considering the circumstances and assuming that Alex cares about Tracy's well-being, turning on loud music may not be a reasonable or valid response to the question. It is more likely that Alex will prefer engaging in quiet activities or chores to not disturb Tracy. Alternative actions that Alex may potentially choose include: 1. Relaxing in a quiet space, such as reading a book or watching TV on a low volume. 2. Catching up on work or personal tasks that require a quiet environment. 3. Engaging in hobby activities like sewing, drawing, or writing. 4. Performing quiet household chores such as folding laundry or sorting mail. Ultimately, while the information provided in this scenario does not guarantee Alex's exact actions, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"turn on loud music\\" is not a valid answer, as it would likely disrupt the resting period for Tracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Almost a decade has passed since the hit sitcom Friends left our television screens. But the show has never been far from one man’s thoughts. Du Xin has opened a mini replica of the show’s Central Perk café in Beijing, China. Friends: Customers chat at a Beijing cafe modelled after the Central Perk cafe in the hit American sitcom Friends. Tucked away on the sixth floor of an office block, the café features the same orange couch, window and doorway and plays re-runs of Friends. Mr Xin, whose nickname is Gunther after the ‘Friends’ character who runs Central Perk, told National Public Radio: ‘I’m crazy about Friends. For me, it’s like a religion. It’s my life.’ The café serves the same snacks mentioned in the show and the menus are filled with fun facts and details from the series. And, it seems like Mr Xin’s idea has caught on, as a second Central Perk recently opened in Shanghai. His obsession doesn’t stop there, however. Obsessed: Du Xin, whose nickname is Gunther, owns the cafe and also has an apartment modelled on the character Joey's. Mr Xin has built a replica of the apartment that the character Joey lived in and it even has an identical foosball table, DVDs of the TV show Baywatch and an oversized cabinet similar to the one Joey made. The show is popular in China because it serves as a tool for learning English and is an introduction to American culture. People dream about the laid-back, friendship-filled lifestyle it portrays which is a far cry from the stressful and competitive world that young Chinese people inhabit. Mr Xin said: ‘That’s why we like Friends. We’re looking for this kind of life.’ He added: ‘I learned a lot from Friends: how to treat friends, girlfriends, my wife, how to be generous, how to be gentle.’ The real thing: The characters of Friends (pictured) used to spend a lot of time in the fictional Central Perk cafe in New York. Friends fans come from all over China to visit Central Perk. Qiu Yu, who lives in Beijing, took a friend visiting from Taiyuan, more than 300 miles away. For Ms Yu, the main attraction of the show is that six friends live on their own, away from the constraints of their families. She said: ‘I think their lives are very free, very happy. They can do whatever they like. For Chinese people the influence of our families is quite big. So we yearn for that lifestyle.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

What is the answer: Which is the longest running Broadway musical in history?","completion":"The longest-running Broadway musical in history is \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a stage musical that first opened on London's West End in 1986 and on Broadway in 1988, based on the French novel Le Fantôme de l'Opéra by Gaston Leroux. Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, it tells the story of a disfigured musical genius who lives beneath the Paris Opera House and struggles to win the love of an innocent opera singer, Christine. The Broadway production is notably the first to surpass 10,000 performances – a milestone it reached on February 11, 2012. After being performed in 27 countries and 144 cities around the world, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is considered by many people as the most successful musical of all time. The longevity of the Phantom on Broadway can be attributed to several factors: First, there is the story itself, which combines romance, horror, mystery and music into a compelling narrative. Second, there is the music. Andrew Lloyd Webber's score is filled with lush, dramatic songs that have remained popular for decades. And finally, there is the production value of the show. From the very beginning, the lavish sets, costumes and special effects (like the iconic chandelier that crashes to the stage) set a high bar for what audiences could expect from a Broadway production. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has received many awards, including the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical. Moreover, the original London cast recording was the first in British musical history to enter the charts at number one. In addition, it stayed at the top position for several weeks and has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling cast album of all time. In conclusion, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is not only the longest-running show on Broadway; it also had an enormous impact on the culture of musical theatre. Many of the attributes that make Phantom so beloved have now become standards in the industry, ensuring that its influence will continue to be felt for many years to come. Its monumental success proves that the combination of a riveting story, spectacular music, and visually stunning production can make a Broadway show run for decades."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Options: - hotel room - garbage - supermarket - medicine cabinet - restaurant A:","completion":"A suitable option in line with common sense for the given situation would be to get the disposable razor at a supermarket. Supermarkets are known for offering a wide range of products, including personal care items like disposable razors. Generally, they provide various options in terms of price, quality, and brand. Considering the person in question did not want to go to a department store, a supermarket serves as a convenient alternative for purchasing a disposable razor. Here's a detailed look at why the other options are less suitable: 1. Hotel room: While some hotels do provide disposable razors as complimentary amenities, they are not always available in every hotel room. Additionally, if the person is not staying in a hotel, this option wouldn't be applicable. 2. Garbage: Getting a disposable razor from the garbage is unsanitary and not a safe or sensible option. Razors should always be clean and unused to avoid potential infections, injuries, or diseases. 3. Medicine cabinet: A medicine cabinet may contain a disposable razor if it belongs to the person in question and they've previously placed one there. However, it might not always be stocked with razors or may only have old ones already in use. Furthermore, if it's someone else's medicine cabinet, it would be intrusive and inappropriate to take a razor from there. 4. Restaurant: It is highly unlikely that a restaurant would have disposable razors available for sale or use. Restaurants focus on providing food and dining services, not personal care items.

Anyanka \\"Anya\\" Christina Emanuella Jenkins is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also appears in the comic book series based on the television show. Portrayed by Emma Caulfield, the character appears as a guest star in the third and fourth seasons of the show before becoming a series regular in the show's fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. Anyanka arrives at Sunnydale High in 1998 (in the episode \\"The Wish\\") as a student named Anya Emerson. She's come to Sunnydale in response to the distress of Cordelia, who is upset after catching her boyfriend, Xander Harris, kissing their friend Willow. After some prompting, Cordelia states: \\"I wish that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.\\" Anya shows her true demon face to Cordelia and says, \\"Done.\\" and the world changes. Now they're in an alternative reality in which Buffy has not come to Sunnydale and the vampire population has multiplied and gained in power. Giles meets with Cordelia before she dies and manages to discern what has happened. He subsequently summons Anyanka and destroys her necklace. As a result, Anya is made mortal again and the world returns to normal. Caulfield said, \\"As far as I know, I don't think Joss Whedon ever intended to have Anya around for more than one episode.\\" However, Anya returns in the episode \\"Doppelgangland\\", duping Willow into assisting in a failed magical attempt to recover the necklace which was her power center, lost when Giles destroyed it to reverse the wish granted for Cordelia. When these efforts fail, she is forced to continue living as a typical high school student. Now with human feelings, she yearns to attend the school prom in spite of her abhorrence of all men; ironically, her only hope for a date is the last man she was sent to punish, Xander. Caulfield says, \\"[Whedon] found this great way to have her interact with the storylines that had developed throughout the entire [third] season.\\" Anya develops feelings for Xander and asks him out again just before graduation. Her romantic plans are foiled when he tells her of the Mayor's plan for his own \\"Ascension\\", a transformation into pure demon, at the graduation ceremony. Anya decides to flee Sunnydale and invites Xander to join her, saying when she thinks something could happen to him, she \\"feels bad inside, like [she] might vomit\\". Xander refuses because he's got \\"friends on the line\\", and can't abandon them. She leaves without him. Anya returns to Sunnydale early in Season Four, still infatuated with Xander. She seduces him (in the episode \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\"). Her lack of experience with people causes her to make straightforward, often tactless remarks, which soon put her at odds with other Scooby Gang members, especially Willow, who has little trust for the ex-demon. Anya's tactlessness is played both for humor and to highlight the truth in situations where others are reluctant to be frank. This is seen most poignantly in \\"The Body\\" when her inability to comprehend Buffy's mother's death leads to inappropriate remarks which at first make others angry, but then allow for catharsis and comfort.

They eventually become engaged, but their wedding plans fall apart when Xander has doubts and leaves her at the altar. Heartbroken and seeking revenge, Anya becomes a vengeance demon again but struggles with her conscience and feelings for Xander. In the final season of the show, Anya perishes during an intense battle against the show's ultimate villains, the First Evil and its army of Turok-Han vampires."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer this question: what is the use of fn key in mac??","completion":"To answer the question about the use of the 'fn' key in a Mac, I will perform the following steps: 1. Identify the purpose of the 'fn' key. 2. Explain its use specifically in the context of Mac computers. Step 1: Identifying the purpose of the 'fn' key The 'fn' (function) key is a modifier key on computer keyboards, including Mac, designed to allow users to access secondary functions of other keys. Step 2: Explaining its use specifically in the context of Mac computers On Mac computers, the 'fn' key is used mainly to access the secondary functions of the function keys ('F1' through 'F12') and other keys with additional functions. For instance, pressing the 'fn' key in combination with a function key will typically provide access to the original function of the key (e.g., 'F1' for help) rather than the default Mac-specific function (e.g., 'F1' to dim the display brightness). Some examples of using the 'fn' key on Macs include: - Pressing 'fn' + 'F1' or 'F2' will adjust display brightness. - Pressing 'fn' + 'F3' or 'F4' will control Mission Control and Launchpad, respectively. - Pressing 'fn' + 'F10,' 'F11,' or 'F12' will adjust volume controls (mute, decrease, or increase). - Pressing 'fn'+'down arrow' to simulate 'page down,' and 'fn'+'up arrow' to simulate 'page up.' By following these steps, I have provided information on the use of the 'fn' key in Mac computers. The 'fn' key is essential for accessing secondary or alternative functions on specific keys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Let's analyze the sentiment from different perspectives. 1. Negative Sentiment: The use of the words \\"unnamed\\" and \\"easily substitutable\\" implies that the subject being referred to is not significant or important enough to be identified by name and that it can be easily replaced with no considerable impact. This might convey the idea that the subject holds a lower value or lesser importance in the given situation. For example, if this sentence were to refer to an employee in a workplace setting, it might be interpreted that the employee is undervalued, not appreciated enough for their contributions, or seen as expendable. In this case, it could be perceived as a negative sentiment towards the subject. 2. Indifferent Sentiment: On the other hand, the sentence could also convey an indifferent or neutral sentiment, depending on the context. It is possible that the unnamed and easily substitutable subject could be a mere object or tool that is not worth mentioning by name because it is just one of many similar ones with no unique features or qualities. For example, if the sentence refers to a generic product or consumable item, then it might be interpreted as indifferent or neutral sentiment towards the subject. In this case, it simply conveys the fact that the object serves its purpose and can be replaced by any similar product, with no emotional or value-based judgment associated with it. In conclusion, while the sentiment of the sentence \\"unnamed, easily substitutable\\" could be perceived as negative if it implies that the subject holds a low value or importance, it may also be viewed as indifferent or neutral based on the context. The specific interpretation will largely depend on the specific situation and the understanding of the reader or listener."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Anna has apparently become fed up with her parents' refusal to take down the embarrassing photos of her at an early age,and is now seeking justice in court.She told the magazine that even though she was 11 years old when her parents started sharing her photos with several hundreds of Facebook friends,they went as far as to post pictures of her as a baby,without ever asking if it was alright with her.\\"They knew no shame and no limit--and didn't care whether it was a picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my bed--every stage was photographed and then made public,\\"the girl said.

Anna's lawyer claims they have a good chance of winning the case in court,if it can be proven that the images have violated her rights to a personal life.But,based on similar cases and according to Austrian privacy laws,if the parents lose,they may be forced to pay their daughter a fine of EUR 3,000 to EUR10,000.

Police say that in what they're treating as an accidental shooting, the 27-year-old daughter was killed by the single round that her mother fired, reports CNN, which notes that police have asked the media not to identify the family because the mother's husband, a 17-year veteran of the St. Cloud Police Department, has served as an undercover narcotics officer. The mother, an Osceola County dispatcher, has not been charged. In a 911 call made Tuesday night, the husband tells dispatchers that his stepdaughter has \\"passed out. She has a pacemaker. She has a heart problem,\\" but he doesn't mention that she had been shot, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Police say that was because he was asleep at the time of the shooting and didn't realize what had happened until his wife explained. The officer has been on administrative leave for family medical reasons, CNN reports. Bay News 9 reports that police believe the daughter was visiting for the holidays. \\"That is one of the saddest things I've ever heard. That's horrible. I mean, just terrible,\\" a neighbor tells the station. (Police in Georgia say a 911 dispatcher may have saved a woman's life by pretending to be her boyfriend.) Expand this summary.","completion":"A tragic incident occurred recently in St. Cloud, Florida, where a 911 dispatcher accidentally shot and killed her own 27-year-old daughter. The woman, who is also the wife of a 17-year veteran of the St. Cloud Police Department, mistook her daughter for an intruder and fired a single round in her direction. The daughter was reportedly visiting for the holidays at the time of the accident, and the police have been treating the shooting as an unintentional event. CNN notes that the police have requested the media to withhold the family's identity, given that the father has previously served as an undercover narcotics officer. The mother, who is employed as a dispatcher for Osceola County, has not faced any charges related to the event. Following the shooting, which took place on a Tuesday night, the husband made a 911 call in which he mentioned that his stepdaughter had \\"passed out,\\" explaining that she had a history of heart problems, including a pacemaker. Interestingly, he did not divulge the fact that she had been shot during the call. The reason for the omission, according to the police, was that the husband had been asleep during the incident and only became aware of the shooting afterwards when his wife informed him. The officer has since been on administrative leave due to family medical reasons, as reported by CNN. The community has reacted with shock and sadness to the tragedy, with one neighbor describing the incident as \\"one of the saddest things I've ever heard.\\" The devastating event serves as a reminder of the importance of exercising extreme caution when handling firearms, even for trained professionals like the 911 dispatcher involved in this case. In a related story from Georgia, another 911 dispatcher was able to save a woman's life by pretending to be her boyfriend during a call. The ongoing dedication and commitment of 911 dispatchers, police officers, and other first responders to keeping communities safe cannot be overstated, but this tragic event in Florida is a stark reminder that even the most well-intentioned actions can have unforeseen and unfortunate consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Jason Rezaian, a 38-year-old dual Iran-US citizen, and his Iranian wife Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody on Tuesday evening, the paper said. Two freelance photographers, also US citizens, were being held too. Western news organisations, including the BBC, have great difficulty operating in Iran, with journalists facing detention and surveillance. \\"We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them,\\" Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said in a statement. Mr Rezaian, who is from California, has been the Post's Iran correspondent since 2012. Ms Salehi works as a correspondent for the National, an English-language newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. Their detention was confirmed by Iran's Chief Justice Gholamhossein Esmaili, who said they were being questioned but did not give a reason for the arrests, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Mr Esmaili said the judiciary would release more details on the detention following \\"technical investigations\\", and said Iranian security forces are \\"vigilant towards all kinds of enemies' activities\\". The detentions of Jason Rezaian and Yeganeh Salehi came as the Iranian authorities step up pressure on independent journalists and bloggers. A number of people have been summoned to Tehran's Evin prison in recent months on charges of involvement in propaganda against the state. Those detained include four female reporters - Marzieh Rasouli, Sajedeh Arabsorkhi, Reyhaneh Tabatabaei and Saba Azarpeik. The media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are currently 64 journalists and social media users imprisoned in Iran. The Iranian authorities have long kept the media under strict control, but arrests and intimidation intensified after the 2009 democracy protests. When President Rouhani took office in August 2013 a number of reporters were released from prison, and Ministry of Intelligence representatives in his new cabinet seemed to have taken a more relaxed approach towards the media. But at the same time journalists have come under renewed pressure from the judiciary and the Revolutionary Guards, who operate outside the government's jurisdiction. President Rouhani has so far said nothing about the latest wave of arrests. A reporter in Tehran for a Western news outlet who has been a friend of Mr Rezaian for five years said the couple had expressed no concern over their security or fears they would be detained. \\"They were just working hard and only talked about how they enjoyed reporting from here,\\" the reporter told the BBC. \\"This is also a surprise, because the atmosphere in general had appeared to become more open for foreign news outlets, at least, with more foreign journalists getting visas and accreditation.\\" Threats against BBC The reporter said that the handful of dual-national journalists operating in Iran are now quite nervous following Mr Rezaian's detention. Authorities in Iran frequently detain or harass journalists working for Western news organisations, and westerners with dual citizenship are typical targets. Iran-based family members of BBC journalists have been questioned by intelligence services, and authorities have attempted to intimidate London-based BBC Persian staff by setting up false Facebook pages on which BBC staff members purport to admit to sexual misconduct or to spying for the UK. Last year, Iran warned the families of 15 BBC Persian Service journalists that their relatives must cease working for the BBC in London, and in some cases the lives of the staff were threatened. In 2009, Iranian-American reporter Roxana Saberi was held for five months after being arrested for purchasing a bottle of wine. She had worked as a freelancer for the BBC and for US radio network National Public Radio. The same year, a reporter for AFP was held for several days.","completion":"The Washington Post's Iran correspondent Jason Rezaian, his Iranian wife Yeganeh Salehi, and two US citizen freelance photographers were taken into custody in Iran.

There are a few essential factors to consider in choosing an appropriate answer: 1. Context: A more elaborate and better-written review is critical to fully understanding the value proposition of the app and how it benefits users. This particular review raises questions about the reviewer's credibility, given the way it was written. 2. Personal preferences and interests: The potential recommendation's suitability is contingent on the friend's preferences, interests, and needs. If the friend values and trusts the opinions provided by online reviews, then this review might influence their impression of the app. However, if the friend prefers relying on more detailed and well-structured reviews or has a different set of app preferences, this review might not be powerful enough to sway their opinion. 3. Quality and credibility of the reviewer: As mentioned earlier, this review's credibility is questionable due to its brevity and grammatical errors. Recommending an app or product typically requires trusting the source of the information. In this case, the review itself does not offer much assurance in terms of the reviewer's competence, and therefore, it might not be compelling enough to warrant a strong recommendation. In conclusion, although the review points to a positive experience with the app, its lack of details and questionable credibility make it difficult to provide a definitive recommendation. A \\"Maybe\\" or \\"Yes\\" answer would be an appropriate response, encouraging further exploration of the app based on the enthusiastic feedback, while also acknowledging the limitations of the review as the sole deciding factor in recommending the app to a friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is important to make sure that your patch matches the fabric in your item. Otherwise, it will stand out from the rest of the material. Look for a patch that matches the fabric of your item as closely as possible. If you do not want to buy a patch, then you can also use a scrap of fabric. Visit a local craft store to find fabric that matches your item, or visit a thrift shop and find something that you can cut up. You can even cut a scrap of fabric off of an old item that you no longer need or want. Frayed edges will get in the way when you are trying to sew the patch in place. They will also cause the patch to stand out more. Use a pair of scissors to snip away any frayed edges on your item. Try to make the edges of the hole as even as possible. You may need to cut your patch material down a bit depending on the size of the hole. Cut the patch so that it is large enough to cover the hole and any weakened areas of the item. The patch should extend beyond the borders of the hole on all sides by about 1” (2.5 cm). Cut the patch so that it is the same shape as the hole as well. For example, if the hole is rectangular, then cut the patch into a similar rectangle. The item needs to be inside out when you sew on the patch so that the edges of the patch will be hidden. Turn your item inside out. Next, identify where the patch needs to go and lay it over the hole. Make sure that all of the edges are completely covering the hole and that the front side of the patch is facing down. Insert pins through the patch and item fabric along each of the edges to secure the patch in place. If your patch has fusing on the back of it, then you may want to iron the patch to secure it in place until you sew it. Apply even pressure to the edges of the patch to secure the patch to the fabric. Do not use steam. You can also use some adhesive, such as fabric glue, or double-sided tape to hold the patch in place until you are ready to sew. or needle. You can either use a sewing machine or hand sew your patch in place. Thread your sewing machine or needle with a thread that matches or will blend in with your fabric. If you cannot find an exact match for your fabric, then try using invisible thread. Depending on the thickness of your patch and item, you may want to use a heavy duty needle in your sewing machine or for hand sewing. For example, if you are sewing a denim patch onto a pair of jeans, then a heavy duty needle will work best. You may also need to adjust the stitch length. Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine or sew a straight stitch by hand using a needle and thread. Sew about ½” (1.3 cm) from the raw edge of the patch to ensure that it is going through the fabric of your item. Sew around the edges of the patch three times to ensure that it is secure. Remove the pins as you sew. Sewing over a pin may damage the needle and possibly even damage the machine. Trim the excess threads when you are finished.

After living amongst the human race and receiving training from the Amazons, Kara is kidnapped by Darkseid and brainwashed into becoming one of his Female Furies. She is ultimately rescued by her cousin, and returns to Earth. After arriving back at the Kent home, Kara and Clark are attacked by Darkseid, and a massive battle ensues. Kara nearly defeats Darkseid thanksto her Amazonian training but is overpowered and almost killed. Kara ultimately saves the day by using a Boom Tube to teleport Darkseid into an unknown area of space, where he is shown to be frozen and floating aimlessly. At the film's conclusion, Kara adopts the Supergirl identity and vows to fight injustice alongside her cousin. Molly Quinn voices Supergirl in Superman: Unbound.

Translate to English","completion":"In contrast, Western Canadian Red Spring Wheat (CWRS) and feed barley suggest the lowest net revenues, due to a combination of increased costs and a decrease in expected prices in 2004-2005. --- As opposed to other grains, Western Canadian Red Spring Wheat (CWRS) and feed barley could potentially lead to the lowest net income in the 2004-2005 period, which is primarily attributed to a surge in expenses, coupled with a significant drop in the anticipated prices for these crops. This shift in revenue expectations can be traced back to various factors influencing the agricultural climate of the time. The Western Canadian Red Spring Wheat, which is regarded for its high-quality characteristics, might be unfavorably affected by the constantly evolving market dynamics and unpredictable agricultural events, such as extreme weather conditions or global market trends deterimental to its demand. Additionally, the increased costs could arise from ongoing changes in seed and fertilizer prices, labor, fuel, and other input aspects, which considerably contribute to the overall production process. Similarly, feed barley, primarily used as fodder for livestock feeding, is also facing challenges due to competitive pressures in the international market. The drop in expected prices for feed barley might stem from the gradually increasing presence of alternative sources of animal feed, such as corn or wheat by-products. These alternative sources can substitute the traditional feed barley in many cases, resulting in a reduced demand and, consequently, causing prices to plummet. Given the potential decline in profitability for Western Canadian Red Spring Wheat and feed barley, farmers might consider steering their production efforts towards other crops with more promising market outlooks and better revenue generation prospects. By carefully analyzing future market trends, as well as constantly staying updated on global agricultural events and advancements, they can make informed decisions regarding the best crops to invest their time and resources in. In conclusion, it is important to note that the agricultural sector, by nature, tends to be highly susceptible to fluctuations in global markets and a variety of external factors. Therefore, while the Western Canadian Red Spring Wheat and feed barley seem to be facing low-net revenue forecasts around 2004-2005, it is crucial for farmers and other stakeholders in the industry to continuously adapt and respond to market changes, while maximizing the potential returns from their agricultural investments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cyano can be killed quickly by dosing the tank with Erythromycin. Erythromycin is a common antibiotic easily found at most Petstores or sold online..","completion":"Option (I) is the better solution for treating Cyanobacteria or Blue-Green Algae in an Aquarium. Cyanobacteria, often misidentified as blue-green or slime algae, is indeed a bacteria rather than an algae or plant. It is a common issue for aquarium enthusiasts, as it can quickly overgrow and disrupt the balance of the aquatic ecosystem. The presence of Cyanobacteria can be indicated by its appearance, which is often a slimy film that can be blue-green, red, or brown-black in color. Erythromycin, an antibiotic commonly found in pet stores and online shops, is an effective treatment for Cyanobacteria in aquariums. As a powerful antibiotic, it works by inhibiting the growth and reproduction of the bacteria, eventually leading to its eradication. When treating an aquarium with erythromycin, it is essential to follow the recommended dosage and instructions provided by the manufacturer. Overdosing can potentially harm beneficial bacteria in the aquarium and cause more significant imbalances in the ecosystem. It is also important to monitor the water parameters throughout the treatment process, conducting regular water changes, and maintaining the aquarium's cleanliness. Option (II) incorrectly identifies Cyanobacteria as a plant rather than bacteria, rendering it less accurate and not the best solution for treating Cyanobacteria in an aquarium. In conclusion, the essential differences between these two statements are how they classify Cyanobacteria. Option (I) accurately describes it as a bacteria, while option (II) mistakenly classifies it as a plant. Therefore, option (I) is the better approach to treating Cyanobacteria or Blue-Green Algae in an aquarium."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - The Haitian Revolution, was a successful anti-slavery and anti-colonial insurrection that took place in the former French colony of Saint-Domingue that lasted from 1791 until 1804. It affected the institution of slavery throughout the Americas. Self-liberated slaves destroyed slavery at home, fought to preserve their freedom, and with the collaboration of mulattoes, founded the sovereign state of Haiti. It led to the greatest slave uprising since Spartacus's unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly 1,900 years prior. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas.

Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Guyana (pronounced or ), officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, is a sovereign state on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, included in the Caribbean Region due to its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the south and southwest, Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west. With , Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay, Suriname and French Guiana. - François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture (20 May 1743 7 April 1803), also known as Toussaint L'Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda, was the best-known leader of the Haitian Revolution. His military and political acumen saved the gains of the first Black insurrection in November 1791. He first fought for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Britain; and finally, for Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti)'s colonial sovereignty against Napoleonic France. He then helped transform the insurgency into a revolutionary movement, which by 1800 had turned Saint-Domingue, the most prosperous slave colony of the time, into the first free colonial society to have explicitly rejected race as the basis of social ranking. - Saint-Domingue was a French colony on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola from 1659 to 1804. The French had established themselves on the western portion of the islands of Hispaniola and Tortuga by 1659. In the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, Spain formally recognized French control of Tortuga island and the western third of the island of Hispaniola.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who organized the Jerome Historical Society?, using the article: Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.To encourage tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park.

Input: By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The Prime Minister has announced the health service is to get an extra £20bn a year by 2023. That will mean an automatic allocation for Northern Ireland, based on its UK population share of just over 3%. However, a Stormont Executive, or direct rule minister, would not be obliged to spend the money on health. Day-to-day spending on the health service in Northern Ireland in 2018/19 is due to be just over £5.3bn. That accounts for just under half of all departmental public spending in Northern Ireland. The additional funds will see NHS spending in England rise by 3.4% annually - but that is still less than the 3.7% average rise the NHS has had since 1948. Analysis BBC News NI Health Correspondent, Marie-Louise Connolly England's health service is to receive a massive cash present to celebrate its 70th birthday. But aren't the devolved regions celebrating 70 years of the health service too? Northern Ireland, along with the other devolved regions, will get a smaller present. Local economists say that could mean an additional £600m by 2023. But the devolved governments can decide how they would like to spend it. It does not mean it goes directly to health and social care. While no doubt the Department of Health in Northern Ireland will stretch out the begging bowl again, the executive might decide to spread the cash around. That brings us to another problem. Currently, Northern Ireland doesn't have an executive, so who will decide how the cash will be spent? Of course the prime minister's cash present comes with a little bit of spin. How much of this extra spending is above existing plans? Is it all entirely \\"new\\" money? Health spending in England was due to increase by £2.6bn in cash terms anyway. Northern Ireland, of course, is benefitting from the DUP confidence-and-supply deal. Details of how much exactly has been released remain unclear. The prime minister said this would be funded partly by a \\"Brexit dividend\\", but also hinted at tax rises. In a BBC interview, Mrs May did not spell out how the £20bn a year would be funded but said: \\"As a country we will be contributing more, a bit more, but also we will have that sum of money that is available from the European Union.\\" But Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as \\"tosh\\". The Conservative MP accused the government of using \\"populist arguments rather than evidence\\".

Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members. Around the beginning of what two things did word universitas start to become prevalent? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The word \\"universitas\\" started to become prevalent around the beginning of urban town life and the emergence of medieval guilds. During this time, society was transforming from a primarily agrarian and feudal structure to one that increasingly focused on urban centers, trade, and specialized crafts and professions. As these changes took place, people began to form associations and guilds to protect their interests, regulate the quality of work, and set standards for membership in their respective fields. As urban communities grew, so did the demand for access to education and knowledge. Students and teachers started to come together in specialized institutions to facilitate learning, a precursor to the modern universities we know today. At the time, education was often provided by the Church, and centers of higher education were established within cathedral and monastic schools. These institutions were granted certain legal rights and privileges by local rulers, religious figures, or townspeople, and they came to be collectively known by the general term \\"universitas.\\" This term thus came to denote, over time, centers of learning and higher education dedicated to the study of various fields, such as theology, law, medicine, and the liberal arts. As they grew and developed, these early institutions often sought to expand their scope and influence beyond local boundaries, eventually forming ties across national and continental borders. In summary, the word \\"universitas\\" began to gain prominence during the rise of urban town life and the emergence of medieval guilds. It reflected the increasing need for specialized, organized bodies of students and teachers to collaborate and gain recognition for their work, eventually leading to the establishment of early universities and the evolution of academic institutions as we know them today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In March 2001, Rice asked the CIA to prepare a new series of authorities for covert action in Afghanistan. Rice's recollection was that the idea had come from Clarke and the NSC senior director for intelligence, Mary McCarthy, and had been linked to the proposal for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice described the draft document as providing for \\"consolidation plus,\\" superseding the various Clinton administration documents. In fact, the CIA drafted two documents. One was a finding that did concern aid to opponents of the Taliban regime; the other was a draft Memorandum of Notification, which included more open-ended language authorizing possible lethal action in a variety of situations. Tenet delivered both to Hadley on March 28. The CIA's notes for Tenet advised him that \\"in response to the NSC request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options, each of the documents has been crafted to provide the Agency with the broadest possible discretion permissible under the law.\\" At the meeting, Tenet argued for deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal authorities to implement it. Hadley accepted this argument, and the draft MON was put on hold. As the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for Afghanistan was included in the draft presidential directive, as part of an \\"Annex A\\" on intelligence activities to \\"eliminate the al Qaeda threat.\\" The main debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on Bin Laden-an armed version of the Predator drone. In the first months of the new administration, questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central focus of dispute. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might provide the elusive \\"actionable intelligence\\" to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles. Learning that the Air Force was thinking of equipping Predators with warheads, Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment. The CTC chief, Cofer Black, argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes. He recalled that theTaliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters. Black wanted to wait until the armed version was ready. \\"I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program termination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN,\\" he wrote.

They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B. Which population would less likley develop cardiovascular diseases, population A or population B? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the relationship between age and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Step 1: Understanding the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases Major risk factors for CVD include age, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and family history of heart disease. Some of these factors, particularly age, can play a significant role in increasing the chances of developing CVD. Step 2: Comparing the age group of population A and population B Population A consists of people in late adulthood, while population B contains younger people. Older adults are more likely to have developed certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease over their lifetime, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. As a result, population A is more likely to be at a greater risk than population B for developing CVD. Step 3: Analyzing the demographics In the context of the given question, Japan and Russia are experiencing a demographic shift, which means they have a growing population of late adulthood (population A). Developing countries have a growing population of younger people (population B). Step 4: Making a conclusion Based on the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases and the age distribution of the two populations, it can be concluded that population B (younger people) would be less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases than population A (late adulthood)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She used a personal email account, the New York Times reports, and it seems she didn't have a government one. The Federal Records Act says her emails should have been held on government servers, but her staff didn't move to put them there, the Times notes. \\"It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario—short of nuclear winter—where an agency would be justified in allowing its Cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,\\" says a lawyer formerly with the National Archives and Records Administration, noting that he can't remember another case in which a top executive-branch official opted to use only a private account. Government emails are supposed to be available when congressional committees or journalists need them. But not until two months ago did staffers go through a trove of Clinton emails and provide 55,000 pages' worth to the government; that came after a State Department request to former secretaries for records, a department spokeswoman tells Politico. What's more, \\"personal emails are not secure,\\" notes a transparency advocate. Indeed, the Washington Post notes that a hacker revealed a Clinton adviser was corresponding with an address at the \\"clintonemail.com\\" domain—which was registered as Clinton's confirmation hearings began in 2009. Meanwhile, fellow 2016 hopeful Jeb Bush released a vast collection of his own emails—he, too, used a personal email account, but the media could request information from it, the Tampa Bay Times notes. \\"Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. jebbushemails.com,\\" Bush tweeted. Expand this summary.","completion":"According to a New York Times report, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have violated guidelines by using her personal email account for government communication, a potential breach of the Federal Records Act, which mandates that all government emails be retained on government servers. It seems that throughout her tenure as secretary, Clinton did not have an official government account and used only her personal account for professional correspondence. This action has raised eyebrows and drawn considerable criticism as it potentially undermines transparency protocols. Former National Archives and Records Administration lawyer commented on the matter, stating that an agency permitting a high-ranking official, such as a Cabinet-level Secretary, to exclusively use a private email for government business is unusual and difficult to justify, barring extreme scenarios like a nuclear winter. Government emails are generally maintained so they can be easily accessed by congressional committees or journalists when required for oversight or information. However, it was not until two months prior to the revelation of this issue that Clinton's staff sifted through a collection of her emails and handed over approximately 55,000 pages' worth to the government. These were provided following a request by the State Department, which had asked previous secretaries for records. A spokeswoman from the department confirmed this to Politico. Critique of the issue highlights that personal emails, unlike their government counterparts, lack secure protection. An example of this was illustrated when a hacker revealed that a Clinton adviser was sending emails to an address at the \\"clintonemail.com\\" domain, an address registered while Clinton's confirmation hearings were in progress in 2009. Comparatively, Jeb Bush, who is also a potential 2016 presidential candidate, used a personal email account during his time as Florida governor. However, his emails were readily available to the media upon request, suggesting a more transparent approach. Expressing his support for transparency, he even tweeted, \\"Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released.

Upon arriving, Beowulf becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife, Queen Wealtheow, who reciprocates his interest. Beowulf and his men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out. When the beast attacks, Beowulf engages him unarmed and naked. During the fight, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has hypersensitive hearing, which is why he interrupts Hrothgar's celebrations â the noise they make is physically painful to him. After his eardrums are ruptured by Beowulf, Grendel attempts to escape. Beowulf restrains Grendel and severs his arm with the door. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty dragon Fafnir. In his cave, the dying Grendel tells his mother what was done to him, and she swears revenge. She travels to Heorot and slaughters Beowulf's men while they are sleeping. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf, who had been sleeping outside the hall during the attack, that it was the work of Grendel's mother. She is the last of the Water Demons, who were thought to have left the land. Beowulf and Wiglaf travel to the demon's cave to slay her. Beowulf enters the cave alone and encounters the demon, who takes the form of a beautiful woman. She offers to make him the greatest king who ever lived, in exchange for a son to replace Grendel and Hrothgar's drinking horn. Beowulf agrees to the deal and returns, claiming to have killed her. Hrothgar, however, realizes the truth. He indirectly tells Beowulf that, much like him, Hrothgar was seduced by her, and Grendel was the result of their tryst.

Q: What term is used to describe modern seed plants that produce seeds in cones? A: Choose your answer from: - angiosperms - deciduous - perennials - gymnosperms Answer:","completion":"Gymnosperms Gymnosperms are the term used to describe modern seed plants that produce seeds in cones. These are a group of plants that are characterized by having a vascular system and seeds that are not enclosed within a fruit. The name gymnosperm comes from the Greek words \\"gymnos,\\" meaning naked or exposed, and \\"sperma,\\" meaning seed, highlighting the presence of seeds that are exposed, making them distinct from the other major group of seed plants, angiosperms. Gymnosperms are an ancient group of plants that first appeared around 390 million years ago, during the Paleozoic Era, predating the angiosperms by around 200 million years. They still play an essential role in many ecosystems worldwide, especially in temperate and colder regions, where they are often the dominant plant forms. Gymnosperms are divided into four main groups - Cycadophyta (cycads), Ginkgophyta (Ginkgo biloba, the only remaining species in this group), Gnetophyta (gnetophytes), and Coniferophyta (conifers). Among these, conifers are the most familiar gymnosperms, featuring in many of our landscapes through the form of pine, spruce, fir, and cypress trees. These are important commercially as sources of timber, resin, and paper pulp. To reiterate, gymnosperms are the term used to describe modern seed plants that produce seeds in cones. The other terms suggested -- angiosperms, deciduous, and perennials -- are not appropriate terms for this particular characteristic. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that form their seeds within an enclosed fruit, which are further divided into monocots and dicots. Deciduous refers to plants that shed their leaves annually, usually in response to seasonal changes. While many gymnosperms are evergreen and do not lose their leaves, some species can exhibit deciduous behavior. Perennials, on the other hand, are plants that live for more than two years, persisting through several growing seasons. Both gymnosperms and angiosperms may contain perennial and deciduous species, depending on their specific biology, climate, and environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (\\"All Over Me\\" and \\"Ol' Red\\"). Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, he was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001. - Randy Bruce Traywick (born May 4, 1959), better known by his stage name, Randy Travis, is an American country music singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor. Since 1985, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Songs charts, and 16 of these were number-one hits. Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music, Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album \\"Storms of Life\\", which sold more than four million copies. The album established him as a major force in the Neotraditional country movement. Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums. He is known for his distinctive baritone vocals, delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Kenneth Arnold \\"Kenny\\" Chesney (born March 26, 1968) is an American country music singer, songwriter and record producer. He has recorded 20 albums, 14 of which have been certified Gold or higher by the RIAA.

Most of these have also charted high within the top 40 of the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart, making him one of the few successful crossover country artists. He has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. - Love Is Strong is the title of the fourth studio album by country music artist Paul Overstreet released in 1992 .

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Like the vast majority of human beings, most girls won't want to ask to be treated well - they'll want you to spontaneously treat them well. If your girlfriend constantly has to ask for the things she likes in your relationship - like for you to hold her hand, listen when she talks, remember her birthday, and so on - these special things are robbed of the joy they might otherwise bring. This can even make her feel isolated or needy. So try to stay on the ball - make an effort to treat your girlfriend with respect without her having to ask you. It's hard to be a steady presence in your girlfriend's life (and vice versa) if you rarely talk to her. Though every couple will have a different natural \\"rhythm\\" of communication, generally, you should try to meet, call, or, at the very least, text your girlfriend once or twice a week, if not more. This should stem from a natural urge to want to know what she's been up to - what minor accomplishments she's made in the last few days, what challenges she's faced, and so on. Be sure to contact your girlfriend on your own - don't just respond to her calls and texts. Taking the initiative to make that crucial first contact with your girlfriend demonstrates that you want her as much as she wants you. Nothing is less romantic than a man who loses sight of what's really important in life in favor of his money or possessions. Your girlfriend should always take precedence over material pleasures. For instance, don't skip your anniversary dinner to wax your new car. Don't neglect your girlfriend for weeks to play an addictive video game. Don't devote your every waking hour to your work. Keep your life in perspective - genuine love is a longer-lasting source of joy than any material gains you can ever hope to make. This being said, a good girlfriend will never willingly ask you to do things that are bad for your financial health. Though the mythical \\"gold-digger\\" is much rarer in real life than popular culture may lead you to believe, beware of women that pressure you into buying expensive gifts. It's normal for a man to show he cares for his girlfriend by celebrating birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and so on with her. It's exceptional for him to show that he cares on the days between these big events. Take your girlfriend by surprise. Celebrate your relationship for no other reason than that you cherish it. This doesn't necessarily have to mean booking a fancy, expensive night out - a simple love note, a rose, a sweet text message, and other things like this can let her know that you are thinking of her and care for her. One of the goals of any good relationship should be for both partners to reach the point where neither has to put on a \\"nice\\" front for the other. Within the context of your relationship, you should be able to truly be \\"you\\" and not one of the characters you adopt for work, school, etc. This won't happen overnight, but it is something that has to happen for a great relationship to develop. Sometimes this may mean being truthful about negative emotions that, for whatever reason, you can't express during your daily life. Be honest and open about these emotions - they're part of the real you - but don't let them become the only topic of conversation in your relationship. This goes far beyond everyday compliments, which can become rote and dull if you repeat them too often. Instead, when you want to make your girlfriend feel amazing, be specific, drawing examples from your personal history and attempting to genuinely express your inner thoughts. Also, try to adjust the \\"sappiness\\" of your comments to a level that you know your girlfriend is comfortable with. Finally, choose especially poignant opportunities to make these types of comments - no matter how good you are with words, you can cheapen your thoughts by repeating them incessantly. For example, if you know your girlfriend is comfortable with a little sappiness in your expressions of verbal affection, rather than saying, \\"Hey, nice dress\\", you might say, \\"I like your dress. It reminds me of that dress you wore when we first met.\\" This is much sweeter and has the added benefit of showing that you remember a small deal from early in your relationship. Summary:","completion":"In order to maintain a healthy and happy relationship, it's essential to treat your girlfriend with respect without her having to ask for it. Communicate regularly and take the initiative to check in on her life and experiences. Make sure that your girlfriend takes precedence over material possessions and maintain a balanced approach to life. Surprise her with small gestures of affection and celebrate your relationship even on ordinary days. Be yourself and be honest about your emotions, while ensuring that they don't dominate your conversations.

Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favourite movie. I don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and lovable script. The charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be. Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has loved it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Question: I can use this background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. Now, I have a new situation: John has been hearing about climate change for last couple of years. He wants to understand the science behind climate change. For that, he picked up two eras in earth's history, era A and era B. Era A was hundred thousand years ago, and era B is in the present day. He now wants to compare these to eras to understand the change in climate better. Answer this question please: Would era A have more or less carbon dioxide in the air than era B? Answer:","completion":"Era A would have less carbon dioxide in the air than era B. Step 1: Analyze the background information The background provided indicates that human activities have increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere more than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and deforestation have contributed to this increase. Step 2: Understand John's situation John wants to compare two eras, era A (hundred thousand years ago) and era B (present day), to understand the changes in climate better. Step 3: Compare carbon dioxide levels in era A and era B Based on the background information, human activities have significantly increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere in recent times. Era A, which was hundred thousand years ago, would not have experienced the same level of human activities and industrialization as era B. Step 4: Draw a conclusion As a result of less human-driven carbon dioxide emissions during era A, it would have had less carbon dioxide in the air compared to era B, which is experiencing higher levels of emissions due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.

Republicans hoping to secure yet another House victory in their already substantial majority won in the 2014 midterm election are on edge as GOP candidate Martha McSally's lead over incumbent Rep. Ron Barber has dwindled down to a mere 161 votes, a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount. This will be the state's first-ever congressional recount. Emerging from election night, McSally led Barber by a mere 36 votes. But technical difficulties later triggered a recount for early votes in Cochise County -- a predominantly Republican area -- that gave McSally a slightly greater lead. Weeks later, Barber tried to cut McSally's lead by challenging a decision by election officials to reject 133 votes from two predominantly liberal counties. But on Thursday, a Tucson federal judge denied the request. Team Barber files suit in uncalled House race. The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner -- determined by Tuesday, December 16. Barber was elected to Congress in 2012 after his boss, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head and severely wounded outside an Arizona supermarket. McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, challenged Barber -- who also suffered two gunshot wounds in the parking lot attack -- for the seat. Barber won his first election with less than 1 percent of the vote in Arizona's second congressional district. The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner -- determined by Tuesday, December 16. The new House balance of power currently stands at 244 Republicans, 188 Democrats and three districts undecided: Gifford's seat and Louisiana's fifth and sixth congressional district. Republicans have a net gain of at least 10 seats and could have a net gain of up to 13 seats, depending on the outcome of this race, as well as two races in Louisiana.

Question: Information: - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre. When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he has been active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz and Dixieland. He has been cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&B and as \\"one of the Crescent Citys greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution.\\" - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - \`\` I 'm Walkin ' '' is a 1957 song by Fats Domino , written together with Dave Bartholomew . The single was Fats Domino 's third release in a row to reach number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart , where it stayed for six weeks . The single also continued Fats Domino 's crossover appeal when \`\` I 'm Walkin ' '' peaked at number four on the pop singles chart . The song was featured in The Blues Brothers movie , during the scene in which the orphanage kids help spread the word of the band 's revival concert . - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Jump blues is an up-tempo style of blues, usually played by small groups and featuring saxophone or brass instruments. It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40.

(April 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story focuses on a British photographer, John Bradley, who is sent into the Thai rain forest to take wildlife photographs. While on assignment, a tribe native to the area takes him captive. Bradley starts in Bangkok, taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a boxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self-defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene. The next day, John begins his trip deep into the rain forest. He rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. John agrees to head back after one more day of traveling. John falls asleep, and when he awakes, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, LuhanÃ , is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks. While hanging, Bradley witnesses the execution of two war criminals by his captive tribe. The tribe is at war with another, even more primitive tribe of cannibals, the...

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. I am facing a new situation today: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the two types of mutations mentioned: germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells (gametes) and can be passed on to the next generation. In contrast, somatic mutations occur in body cells and cannot be passed on to the next generation. Step 2: Identify which group has which type of mutation. In the new situation, Group A presents germline mutations, while Group B presents somatic mutations. Step 3: Determine which group has fewer organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells. From the information given in the background article, germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, meaning that Group A (having germline mutations) will have more organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells. Consequently, Group B (having somatic mutations) will have fewer organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells, as these mutations occur in body cells and not sex cells. Answer: Group B had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet. - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\") are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen. - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes. - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the given equation -16*m + 45*m = 58 for m, we first need to combine the like terms on the left side of the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms Since both terms on the left side of the equation contain the variable m, we can combine them by performing the addition operation. -16*m + 45*m = (45 - 16)*m = 29*m So the simplified equation is: 29*m = 58 Step 2: Isolate variable m To find the value of m, we need to isolate m on one side of the equation. In this case, m is already isolated on the left side and multiplied by 29. To get m alone, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 29: (29*m) / 29 = 58 / 29 Since (29 / 29) is equal to 1, the left side simplifies to just m: m = 58 / 29 Step 3: Solve for m Now that we have isolated m, we can solve the equation by performing the division operation: m = 58 / 29 = 2 The value of the variable m in the given equation is 2.

Answer:","completion":"Quigley Down Under is a western adventure film that was released on October 17, 1990 in the United States. Directed by Simon Wincer, and starring Tom Selleck in the titular role of Matthew Quigley, the movie tells the story of an American sharpshooter who travels to Australia during the late 19th century to take a job using his exceptional long-range shooting skills. However, upon arriving, he finds himself embroiled in a conflict with the abusive local landowner, played by Alan Rickman, whose cruel practices against the native Aboriginal population contradict Quigley's moral compass. Set against the backdrop of the Australian Outback, the film blends elements of both the traditional Western genre and Australian bush-ranging narratives, offering audiences a unique take on the era's colonial dynamics. While the movie received mixed reviews from critics upon its initial release, it has since gained a cult following and is appreciated for its thrilling storyline, rich visual settings, and strong performances, particularly from Selleck and Rickman. As a piece of cinematic history, Quigley Down Under remains an enduring example of early 1990s filmmaking that continues to find ardent fans to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A United States Air Force crew is dispatched by General Fogerty (David McMahon) from Anchorage, Alaska at the request of Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the chief scientist of a North Pole scientific outpost. They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed in their vicinity, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story. Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding (George Fenneman) shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteorite. Following erratic magnetic pole anomalies, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the team's C-47. The mysterious craft lies buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft's general shape, they realize they are standing in a circle: they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try deicing the buried craft with thermite heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice. They excavate a large block of ice around what appears to be a tall body and fly it to the research outpost, just as a major storm moves in, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives further instructions from the Air Force.

Focus your content on providing information which sells your features through benefits. Cite real-world examples or case studies. Aim to answer the question of how your customer will benefit from your product or service. Your goal is to keep earning your reader’s focus and attention. Cater your content to the type of reader you are hoping to attract with your brochure. If you’re writing a brochure to generate leads include info that prospects don’t know about your company. Give a brief blurb on the history of your company and why you are different and better than the competition. However, if your brochure is a sales closer your customers already know your company’s history. Don’t bore readers with information that gives a potential customer a reason to stop continuing on to the next section. Keep the content relevant to your brochure’s purpose. But also brief enough to not run out your reader's interest. . Your content should highlight the benefits of what you are offering, not just features. Instead of only providing content that shows your product, include a lifestyle atmosphere. Show how your product will benefit your customer’s life.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of drinking low acidic drinks like kefir can have an indirect effect on the process of digestion. Kefir is a fermented milk drink that contains beneficial probiotics and lactic acid. When consumed, it may help in breaking down the food and promoting the growth of good bacteria in the gut. However, the low acidity of kefir may have minimal impact on the stomach's ability to process food efficiently, as the stomach naturally secretes hydrochloric acid to maintain its highly acidic environment (pH 1.5 to 3.5). This acidity is crucial for effective digestion and killing harmful bacteria. Kefir may not significantly alter the stomach's acidity, but it can contribute to better gut health and digestion by providing beneficial bacteria and enzymes. These can help in the breakdown of complex food molecules in the small intestine, assisting in the absorption of nutrients, and overall improve gut health by maintaining a healthy balance of gut flora.

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile.

Action on homophobic bullying was previously addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who committed to \\"specifically targeting\\" the issue in Church schools. Despite the Church's official opposition to active homosexuality, the Archbishop recognised the quality of some gay relationships, and framed the effort as a broader challenge in responding to same-sex relationships and issues. The collaboration marks a noteworthy step as the Church and Stonewall have not always agreed on legislative issues, with the Church previously opposing the introduction of civil partnerships and same-sex marriage. Regardless, both groups see this initiative as necessary, in line with society's widespread abhorrence towards homophobic behaviour. In summary, the Church of England and Stonewall have embarked on a collaboration to fight homophobic bullying in Church schools, marking a pivotal shift in their relationship and an important response to the ongoing issues faced by the LGBTQ+ community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hi little buddy! Today, we are going to talk about touchdown passes in football and how short they can be. You know how fun it is to watch football games, right? Sometimes, you see players throwing the ball to their teammates to score touchdowns. These are called touchdown passes! Now, you might be wondering - how many yards was the game's shortest touchdown pass? Well, the shortest touchdown pass in a game can be just one yard! That's right; it can be as short as the distance from your nose to your fingertip! 🏈 Imagine this: the team has the football really, really close to their opponent's goal line. They only need to move the ball one tiny step forward to score a touchdown. The quarterback, who is the player responsible for passing the ball, quickly throws it to a teammate who catches the ball just across the goal line. And guess what? They score a touchdown with a one-yard pass! 🎉 In football games, there can be really long touchdown passes, even more than 80 yards! But sometimes, when the teams are really close to the goal, they only need a tiny little throw to score. So, the shortest touchdown pass in a game can be just one yard! Now, go tell your friends and family about the game's shortest touchdown pass, and maybe you can even play a fun game of football yourself!

Which entity is this text about? Sydney Francis Barnes (19 April 1873 - 26 December 1967) was an English professional cricketer who is generally regarded as one of the greatest ever bowlers. He was right-handed and bowled at a pace that varied from medium to fast-medium with the ability to make the ball both swing and break from off or leg. He is the quickest bowler to achieve 150 Test wickets in history. Barnes was unusual in that, despite a very long career as a top-class player, he spent little more than two seasons in first-class cricket, representing Warwickshire and Lancashire. Barnes' career began in 1888 when he was fifteen and played for a small club which had a ground behind the Galton Hotel in Smethwick. Soon afterwards, he joined Smethwick Cricket Club and played for its third team. He was taught to bowl off spin by Billy Bird, the Smethwick professional who had played for Warwickshire, and then taught himself to bowl leg spin. In due course, he was selected for the second team and had earned a place in the first team, playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League, at the start of the 1893 season. In 1894, when Barnes was a 21-year-old fast bowler, he was asked to join the ground staff of Staffordshire County Cricket Club but he found the terms unattractive. Instead, he joined Rishton Cricket Club in the Lancashire League where the pay was better than in any form of county cricket, largely because of match bonuses and collections. Wilfrid S. White commented that Barnes' career in league cricket \\"stands out unparalleled, unapproached, by any other player\\". Later in the 1894 season, Barnes was invited to play for Warwickshire, who were due to enter the County Championship in 1895. His debut was in a minor match against Cheshire at Edgbaston on 20-21 August. Barnes bowled only 8 overs, taking none for 27, and the match was drawn. On 23 August, Barnes made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground, except that he did not take the field as play was restricted by bad weather to just 72 overs of his team's first innings, in which they reached 102-2.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Police: 7-year-old fatally shot by father outside gun store in Pennsylvania So the father tried to sell his loaded 9mm? Not knowingly, anyway. Unfortunately, he apparently did not have enough experience with firearms to appreciate the importance of habitually clearing firearms completely as soon as they are in one's hands. I only put one in the chamber if I feel threatened. The guy must not have been feeling threatened as he was trying to sell his guns so why was one in the chamber? Many people who have firearms for defensive use have a round in the chamber. If you have a revolver, having it loaded at all means you have a round in the chamber, whether or not the chamber under the hammer contains a cartridge. Some firearms have a safety which may be engaged, some, such as revolvers and so-called 'Double Action Only' pistols do not as the long, heavy trigger pull acts to prevent unintentional tripping of the trigger. With an automatic pistol, unfortunately, the rapid reload you get by inserting a loaded magazine and bumping the slide lock release comes at the expense of the risk of unwittingly putting a round in the chamber 'automatically' if one has pulled the slide back to check the barrel and chamber upon picking the gun up. Someone who does not fully understand the operation of the gun or isn't thinking through what they're doing may mistakenly believe the chamber is as empty as when they examined it before they inserted a magazine and hit the slide release. This can happen with pretty much any repeating firearm, but is especially hazardous with autoloaders and part of why so many people have been shot by guns thought to have been unloaded. And yes, the gun was pointed at the son. We know that because that's where the bullet went. Bullets don't curve. Bullets don't 'curve', but they most certainly can ricochet! Handgun bullets especially can bounce off of what they cannot penetrate. No indication that this happened here, but in a confined space with many hard surfaces, it certainly can be a factor. And yes, his finger was on the trigger. Guns don't fire, they are fired - and that's not a minor grammatical quibble. We don't know that his finger was actually on the trigger. Guns are not always intentionally fired. Anything that makes contact with the trigger and can move it enough to release the hammer or striker can cause a loaded gun to discharge. A gun with a single action trigger that has been cocked (which it would be, by default, when the round is stripped from the magazine by the closing slide and forced into the chamber) is especially susceptible to a mishap should something make contact with the trigger. Accidents have happened when a loaded handgun was pushed into a holster that didn't fit it quite right. A number of hunting accidents have occurred through the years when hunters attempted to move or retrieve a loaded rifle or shotgun, safety off, and the trigger snagged on foliage, something in the vehicle, or even some gear that the hunter was wearing at the time. In the case of a handgun, if it was placed in the wrong place or the person setting it down fumbled, the gun is small and light enough that it could start out pointed in a 'safe' direction, the trigger makes contact with some relatively immovable object, and as the trigger (which is a curved surface) starts to creep backwards, the gun may rotate around the axis formed by that curved trigger and whatever it was in contact with. By the time the trigger has moved enough that the sear surfaces break contact, it may have rotated some number of degrees and is pointed in a thoroughly undesired direction when the hammer or striker is released. Further, if whatever contacts the trigger is vibrating, such as a part of a running vehicle, an autoloader may fire multiple times. This happened to a member of my father's battalion one day when they were under attack. The soldier's 'cocked and locked, trigger unblocked' M14 rifle slipped in the rack (that it probably wasn't correctly placed in) that kept the rifle handy in the cab of the truck the soldier was driving. As the rifle slipped, the muzzle ended up in line with the soldier's head as part of the rack or the driver's seat contacted the trigger. The rifle was still more or less captive but the truck was running and vibrating. The trigger kept resetting and tripping in turn, and an entire magazine full of twenty 7.62 NATO cartridges ( .308 Winchester) were fired into his head and through the roof of the truck cab. Like any accident, one or more 'little' detail items went wrong, and a chain of inadequacies or mishaps resulted in catastrophe. Handguns, no matter what make, no matter what model, are designed and intended for just one thing - shooting people. You don't hunt with them (you may target shoot, but what's the point) Quite a few people hunt with handguns, actually. There are dedicated seasons in many areas for them, just as there are for muzzleloaders and bow and arrow. As far as target shooting not having a point, ask a competitive shooter about that. It is an Olympic sport, after all, and there are many leagues and competitions for pistol and revolver shooting. This is what all those target pistols in calibers ranging from .22 to .45 are for! To repeat, handguns are intended only for shooting people. Ah, what a heartwarming display of IGNORANCE. Nice to know that's not becoming a lost art, I guess... If you have a handgun, the odds that you will actually load it and point it at a person with the intent of pulling the trigger is almost zero. Yeah, because a lot of people who have purchased handguns never had any intent to use it as a weapon. A great many were purchased purely for recreational use and aren't even kept handy in a loaded state when not in use. If only there were more guns these things would be a thing of the past. If only there was more education these things would be a thing of the past. Too bad all the use (mostly misuse) of firearms we've all been watching on television and in movies for pretty much our entire lives has seldom if ever included any safe handling procedures, such as clearing actions and checking chambers. A person can be told to do these things, but the only way one really learns is to spend time around someone who fastidiously does these things consistently. People learn by example, and if you're not SEEING people safely handle firearms, you're probably not going to be doing it, either. Until, that is, you have a close call or an accident, of see someone else have one. Then, suddenly, the idea of safe handling makes PERFECTLY CLEAR SENSE to you. I would strongly suggest that people think twice about calling this guy things like 'idiot' and 'moron', because when we say that, we imply that he was, we're not, and that's what makes us different from him. The only thing that made him different than some of us was that he either was not aware of one seemingly small but critically important detail, or else his mind was not completely on what it should have been, which was safely handling the firearm in his possession. It can happen to any one of us if we inadvertently allow ourselves to end up in the same place. Accidents tend to happen when we're not consciously proactive in preventing them. Even with a loaded chamber, this could have been absolutely prevented if the pistol was being transported in a hard case, preferably one with locking hasps. In most places, the law requires that handguns be transported in a secure case, out of the reach of the vehicle driver or passengers. Field stripping the pistol (drop the magazine, remove the slide and barrel) before transporting it probably isn't going to hurt anything, either, or at least transporting it with the magazine removed and the slide locked back.

Pump the inflatable boat according to the manual's instructions.","completion":"Next, ensure that all air chambers and compartments are filled uniformly, taking care not to overinflate the boat, as this could cause damage and leaks, compromising its structural integrity and seaworthy performance. Once your boat has reached the desired level of inflation and is sufficiently sturdy, inspect it carefully for any wrinkles or creases, as these can impact the overall stability and comfort while on the water. Double-check all valves and seals to guarantee they are tight and secure, as this will prevent any undesired deflation or air leakage, preserving buoyancy and control in various water conditions. To commence rowing the inflatable boat, position yourself comfortably on the provided seating area, ensuring you are evenly balanced and centered to optimize maneuverability and reduce excess rocking or swaying. Insert the oars into the oarlocks, ensuring they are firmly fixed and can't easily come undone while rowing, but still allowing for smooth pivoting motion. It's important to familiarize yourself with the essential rowing techniques, such as feathering the oars (angling the blades to streamline them during recovery) and engaging a coordinated combination of leg, core, and upper body muscle groups to maximize efficiency and prevent fatigue. Rowing an inflatable boat typically involves alternating repetitive movements of the arms and upper body in sync while adjusting the oar blades' positions in the water to propel the craft forward or change direction. Key techniques include the catch (immersing the oar blades in the water), the drive (pushing the oars through the water), and the recovery (lifting the oars out of the water and returning them to the catch position). To maintain a stable and steady pace, make sure to keep a rhythmic pattern as you row, with an even distribution of power and control between both oars – this ensures smoother sailing and prevents the boat from veering off-course. While rowing, pay close attention to your surroundings, including any change in weather conditions, currents, or the presence of specific obstacles or hazards. Always practice good seamanship by obeying all local waterway rules and regulations, conforming to the necessary safety recommendations (such as wearing life jackets), and maintaining awareness and courtesy towards other watercraft in the vicinity. During your rowing journey, it is advisable to monitor the inflation level of your boat, ensuring that pressure remains consistent throughout the voyage. Should it become necessary to adjust the inflation due to fluctuations in air or water temperature, or to address any potential leaks, you must carry a manual hand pump or a compatible electric pump and patch kit to ensure you are well-equipped to rectify any issues promptly. Once you have mastered the art of rowing your inflatable boat, it becomes a wonderfully exciting and versatile recreational activity that can be enjoyed in various bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and coastal shores. While effectively navigating these waterways, you can indulge in a wide range of pursuits, such as fishing, exploration, wildlife observation, or simply spending quality time with loved ones in a tranquil and inspiring outdoor environment. Enjoy the pleasurable and rewarding experience of rowing an inflatable boat, and appreciate the unique sense of freedom and adventure that it brings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Instructions: Given a travel related situation, and given a specific question about the situation, summarize the question into a title Input: Rental car companies almost all have in their terms that the driver must have had a license for some amount of time, usually 1 to 5 years. However, on my driver's license it only shows the date that particular card was issued, not the date I first got my license. I imagine this is the case for a lot of people. Because licenses expire every few years, this \\"issued\\" date will often not meet the time requirement. What documentation do I use to prove to a rental car company how long I've had my license? I doubt they just take you at your word. It has been suggested that this question is a duplicate of this one. However, nothing there answers my question. The most relevant answer there says: First things first: rental companies will check your driving licence for validity before they confirm your rental car. Secondly your age will be checked since there are usually extra fees to be paid by young (< 25 years old) drivers. But then makes this claim from those statements: Having performed these two checks they will know if you qualify as a young driver, and from there computing the validity years of your licence will be a trivial operation. I fail to see how computing the validity years of a license is a \\"trivial operation\\" once you know the drivers age and have their license. If the license does not have the first issue date on it, merely knowing how old someone is does not in any way tell you how long they have had their license. Output:","completion":"Part 1: The travel related situation. Usage: Rental car companies require the driver to have had a license for a certain amount of time. This is a key part of the definition because it sets the context for the question, which is about proving the duration of one's driver's license to a rental car company. Part 2: The problem with the driver's license. Usage: The driver's license only shows the date it was issued, not the date the person first got their license. This is an important part of the definition because it highlights the main issue that needs to be addressed - proving the length of time one has had a license. Part 3: The question being asked. Usage: What documentation do I use to prove to a rental car company how long I've had my license? This is the specific question that needs to be summarized into a title.

Bambi felt convinced that his coming meant the premature death of her new-born career, so, naturally, she was prepared for grief. An element of amusement was added, however, by Jarvis's astonishing behaviour. Ever since the first mention of Mr. Strong's name he had shown unmistakable signs of dislike for that gentleman. 'It was the most remarkable revelation of his strange character. Having totally ignored Bambi himself, it distressed him to think of any other man being attracted by her. His references to Mr. Strong's coming were many and satirical. This display of manly inconsistency was nuts and ale to Bambi. She wondered how much Mr. Strong would play up, and she decided to give Jarvis Jocelyn an uncomfortable hour. She herself was an adept in amatory science, but she was a trifle unsure of Mr. Strong. However, she remembered a certain twinkle in his eye that augured well. Because it was necessary to enlighten him as to the situation in advance, she arrayed herself most carefully to go and meet him. She encountered Jarvis on the stairs.

Please briefly summarize this news article: China - Information, News and Pictures - WSJ.com Ford Motor's vehicle sales in China rose in May amid strong demand for its midrange passenger cars, despite recent signs of a slowing Chinese auto market and expiring government sales incentives. Little trace remains of the accusations made by a man suspected to have set three explosions in southeast China late last month, but now the ghost of bomber Qian Mingqi is haunting the local government he allegedly attacked. Canada's Sunshine Oilsands plans to raise around 1 billion in a Hong Kong IPO in the fourth quarter, making it the latest Canadian energy company to tap funds via a listing in the territory. Resourcehouse, which over the weekend pulled plans for a Hong Kong IPO, said it has secured a further 1.28 billion in funding from Export-Import Bank of China to develop its coal project in Australia's Queensland state. Apple announces its latest software: iCloud and iTunes Match, adding a new level of competition for Asian companies like Samsung. Plus, China's state media lashes out at Google's allegations of China-based hacking. WSJ's Jake Lee and Yun-Hee Kim discuss. Everyone wants the woo the deep-pocketed Chinese tourist. Peng Liyuan, the wife of Xi Jinping, China's likely next president, has taken a step into the international spotlight by becoming a Goodwill Ambassador for Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS for the World Health Organization. Few Chinese believe Google was the victim of a cyber attack originating from a technical college in the country's northeast, not least because of Shandong Lanxiang Vocational School's hokey advertising. A leading Chinese government newspaper lashed out at Google, saying its allegations of China-based hacking were an attempt to spark disputes over Internet security between China and the U.S. Cash-strapped Belarus is considering the sale of one of its most valuable state-owned assets, potash giant Belaruskali, and has already discussed possible deals with investors from China and Russia. Volvo Car's cautious European CEO and its new hard-charging Chinese owner are striving to reconcile differing visions and management styles. Chinese companies are stepping up foreign direct investment and focusing especially on Europe, where they have purchased control of, or stakes in, hundreds of businesses in recent years. This is not a great day so far for the U.S. dollar, which is down about 0.5% against the euro and the British pound (though it's up against the yen and the Swiss franc, so it's not that bad of a day). Volvo Car's CEO Stefan Jacoby methodically worked his way up the ladder in the auto industry. His greatest accomplishment may be helping forge a compromise path between staid Volvo and its hard-charging new Chinese parent. All the finance news you need to feel smart this morning.

No The sentence \\"The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east.\\" doesn't provide a direct or detailed answer to the question \\"Hurricanes and tropical storms can produce what across the coastal plain?\\". The question is evidently asking for the specific phenomena or effects produced by hurricanes and tropical storms across the coastal plain. This could entail details on the intensification of rainfall and potential flooding, powerful winds, increased coastal erosion, storm surges, or any other effects generally associated with hurricane and tropical storm systems as they move across these lowland areas near the sea. On the other hand, the given sentence is focusing more on the role of mountains in breaking up storm systems, particularly in the western Piedmont region, rather than discussing about what hurricanes or tropical storms can produce across coastal plains. While it does indicate storms may reform farther east (this could imply towards the coastal plains, given the geographical orientation), there are no specific details relating to the impact or effects of these reforming storms within that sentence. Therefore, the provided sentence doesn't provide an adequate or direct response to the posed question. To answer the question correctly, the required response would need to detail the effects and phenomena that hurricanes or tropical storms are known to create or intensify over coastal plains.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The computer is a useful machine. It is the most important invention in many years. The oldest kind of computer is the abacus , used in China centuries ago, but the first large, modern computer was built in 1946. A computer then could do maths problems quite fast. Today computers are used in many ways and can do many kinds of work. In a few years the computer may touch the life of everyone, even people in faraway villages. In the last few years, there have been great changes in computers. They are getting smaller and smaller, and computing faster and faster, Many scientists agree that computers can now do many things, but they cannot do everything. Who knows what the computers of tomorrow will be like? Will computers bring good things or bad things to people? The scientists of today will have to decide how to use the computers of tomorrow.

Option B (\\"must decide\\") closely matches the phrase \\"will have to decide\\" from the article, indicating that it is the scientists' responsibility to make decisions about the future use of computers. Step 4: Verify that the other options do not fit as well. Option A (\\"may decide\\") suggests the choice is optional, which is less strong than the article's assertion. Option C (\\"can make\\") does not directly address the decision-making aspect. Option D (\\"needn't make\\") implies that the decision is not necessary, contradicting the article.

The abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in northeast Nigeria has been denounced by U.S. President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. That has given them all the publicity they crave. Their movement is now the top item on all global news channels. If, as I suspect, Boko Haram sees itself as a suicide mission to inspire all Muslims to follow them and wage war on the West, they must feel their hour has come. The final battle is about to begin. Bornu state Nigeria is one of the poorest, most neglected parts of the planet. Until recently I would have said the only surplus in that part of Nigeria was its long-suffering Islamic resignation. Now that has turned to anger. And this remote, dry, dusty corner of Nigeria, a place you would only visit on your way to the Sahara Desert, has become the new battleground between militant Islam and the Western world.

After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes.But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the last names of the two people the advance scout troop of 90 men were under? By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition... Answer:","completion":"The last names of the two people the advance scout troop of 90 men were under are Bowie and Fannin. This troop was sent by Stephen F.

Torkildson wrote a post about the firing here. “I had to look up the word,” Woodger allegedly told him, “because I didn’t know what the hell you were talking about. We don’t teach this kind of advanced stuff to our students, and it’s extremely inappropriate. Can you have your desk cleaned out by eleven this morning? I’ll have your check ready.” The story was picked up by the Salt Lake Tribune, where it reads as an article worthy of The Onion. According to the Tribune, Woodger says his reaction to Torkildson’s blog has nothing to do with homosexuality but that Torkildson had caused him concern because he would \\"go off on tangents\\" in his blogs that would be confusing and sometimes could be considered offensive. Nomen is Utah’s largest private English as a Second Language school and caters mostly to foreign students seeking admission to U.S. colleges and universities. Woodger says his school has taught 6,500 students from 58 countries during the past 15 years. Most of them, he says, are at basic levels of English and are not ready for the more complicated concepts such as homophones . ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"An education blogger in Utah was fired from his job at the Nomen Global Language Center after writing a blog post explaining \\"homophones.\\" Tim Torkildson claimed he was dismissed by the NGLC owner, Clarke Woodger, for promoting a gay agenda.

Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead.

He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings.

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments., what would be the answer ?

Red: In nature, the red color of blood comes from hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates. The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"When food is consumed, the process of digestion begins. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that eating food will affect how enzymes break down nutrients. In this context, the perturbation has a direct effect on the process. As food enters the small intestine, the pancreas senses the presence of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. In response, it secretes digestive juices containing enzymes specifically designed to break down these nutrients. The presence of food in the small intestine acts as a signal for the pancreas to release these enzymes, aiding in the process of digestion. Furthermore, the consumption of food can also lead to fluctuations in blood sugar levels. As a result, the pancreas releases insulin when blood sugar levels rise after a meal, helping lower the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. Conversely, when blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon, which helps raise glucose levels. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis postulates that eating food has a direct effect on the secretion and activity of enzymes during the digestion process. This influence is seen in the production of digestive juices and the regulation of blood sugar levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Some plants and animals were able to survive through ice ages because of volcanic steam and and heat emissions, according to scientists. This image shows a man standing in volcanic steam in Antarctica. (Photo : Peter Convey / British Antartic Survey) Some plants and animals were able to survive through ice ages because of volcanic steam and heat emissions, according to scientists. The research focused on Antarctic species which have been collected throughout the decades. Of these tens of thousands of species on record, the researchers found that more species were collected close to volcanoes than there were specimens collected farther away. If the researchers' theory is correct, it could solve a long-standing mystery surrounding why some species survived and continued to evolve through past ice ages in parts of the planet covered by glaciers. Share This Story \\"Volcanic steam can melt large ice caves under the glaciers, and it can be tens of degrees warmer in there than outside,\\" research leader Ceridwen Frase, a biogeographer from the Australian National University, said in a statement. \\"Caves and warm steam fields would have been great places for species to hang out during ice ages.\\" \\"Volcanoes are generally seen as these big, explosive destroyers of life, but they might be important in promoting biodiversity,\\" Fraser said, according to LiveScience. \\"This explains how life survived in Antarctica, but we think this idea of geothermal refuges could also apply elsewhere.\\" \\"We can learn a lot from looking at the impacts of past climate change as we try to deal with the accelerated change that humans are now causing,\\" she added. The researchers examined diversity patterns of mosses, lichens and bugs which are still common in Antarctica today. About 60 percent of Antarctic invertebrate species are found no where else on Earth, said British Antarctic Survey's Peter Convey. \\"They have clearly not arrived on the continent recently, but must have been there for millions of years. How they survived past ice ages - the most recent of which ended less than 20,000 years ago - has long puzzled scientists,\\" Convey said. Antarctica has at least 16 volcanoes that have been active since the last ice age 20,000 years ago. Fraser and her colleagues, including Aleks Terauds from the Australian Antarctic Division, suggest that this revelation may help scientist understand how species survived past ice ages in icy regions other than Antarctica. \\"The closer you get to volcanoes, the more species you find. This pattern supports our hypothesis that species have been expanding their ranges and gradually moving out from volcanic areas since the last ice age,\\" Terauds said. The researchers said these biodiversity \\"hot spots\\" can be identified and protected as Antarctica continues to be affected by anthropogenic climate change. The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ||||| Like an ice age radiator, heat from volcanoes helped Antarctica's plants and bugs survive Earth's glacial periods, scientists think based on the result of a new study. The findings suggest that volcanoes can provide a cozy home for plants and animals during ice ages, either in ice caves or on warm ground heated by geothermal features such as hot springs, the researchers said. The study was published today (March 10) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"Volcanoes are generally seen as these big, explosive destroyers of life, but they might be important in promoting biodiversity,\\" said Ceridwen Fraser, a biogeographer at Australian National University in Canberra and lead study author. \\"This explains how life survived in Antarctica, but we think this idea of geothermal refuges could also apply elsewhere.\\" Frozen in place Today, mosses, lichens and small invertebrates thrive along Antarctica's coast. In some spots, the bright green mosses form a thick, lush carpet, growing up to 10 feet (3 meters) deep. But even these hardy plants suffered during Earth's last ice age 20,000 years ago, when the planet's temperature dropped and Antarctica's ice sheets covered nearly all its land and cloaked the sea. Genetic and fossil evidence suggests that during the ice age, any Antarctic species that could cross the Southern Ocean fled, with penguins, seals and birds heading for warmer refuges. \\"The only species that were left in Antarctica were those that couldn't get off,\\" Fraser said. Genetic analyses also indicate that Antarctica's mosses, lichens and small invertebrates have been isolated from their relatives on other continents for millions of years. More than 60 percent of its bugs live nowhere else on Earth. This means these species probably survived the ice age by sheltering in place, rather than repopulating Antarctica by crossing the vast Southern Ocean after the ice age ended. A hot haven A BBC television documentary on Mount Erebus, Antarctica's largest volcano, inspired Fraser and her colleagues to test whether Antarctica's volcanoes were an ice age haven. Mount Erebus is an active volcano, with ice caves that harbor microbial life today. [Fire and Ice: Images of Volcano-Ice Encounters] \\"I thought that ice caves would be a fantastic place for life to hang out during an ice age,\\" Fraser told Live Science's Our Amazing Planet. \\"We decided to look at whether there was any evidence that these species could have survived at volcanoes, and that is what we found.\\" Antarctica has at least 16 volcanoes that have erupted in the past 20,000 years (more evidence of as yet undiscovered eruptions could be hidden below the ice.) At spots such as Deception Island, underlain by a large magma chamber, geothermal heating could have kept the ground ice-free during the past ice age, the researchers said. \\"These were not only ice-free, but much warmer,\\" Fraser said. \\"These were really nice, warm places.\\" Fraser and her co-authors analyzed more than 38,000 records of Antarctic species, and discovered there are more moss, lichen and bug species close to Antarctica's volcanoes, and fewer farther away. The pattern supports the idea that these species weathered the worst of the ice age at Antarctica's volcanoes, then gradually expanded their habitat range after the ice receded. \\"This suggests that all of the colonization has been from the volcanoes slowly over time,\\" Fraser said. A man stands in a cloud of volcanic steam in the Antarctic South Sandwich Islands. Credit: Pete Convey Bringers of life Another potential ice age refuge was Antarctica's nunataks, isolated peaks that are surrounded by ice. But nunataks usually have a unique assortment of life that is different from lowland species, so it's unlikely that plants and small invertebrates repopulated the coast from nunataks, Fraser said. In the Northern Hemisphere, scientists have also discovered fossil evidence of ice age refuges in the high latitudes, where plants such as white spruce trees thrived in places like Norway, despite chilly weather and giant glaciers. These \\"cryptic refugia\\" have not yet been directly linked to volcanoes or geothermal areas. \\"We know that they existed but we don't know why,\\" Fraser said. \\"We think that volcanoes and geothermal areas could have potentially helped life survive in those regions as well.\\" Fraser and her colleagues now plan to test whether the genetic patterns of moss and other species also support the idea of volcanic refuges in Antarctica.

Movie title: Snakes on a Plane Movie plot: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade.

Article: When considering a particular topic, if you have had any sort of experience with it—good or bad—there’s no doubt that those experiences help shape your current beliefs on the matter. However, it’s important to recognize that not all experiences accurately reflect the entire picture or the whole truth. Part of forming an opinion comes from separating your feelings and emotions from the facts. For instance, if you were bit by a German Shepherd as a small child, you could hold the opinion that all German Shepherds are dangerous; or your opinion may be as extreme as believing that all dogs are dangerous. When seeking and forming your own opinion, like whether or not German Shepherds (or dogs in general) are good animals, you need to be able to set aside your personal experiences and look at the bigger picture. Having a conversation with those who are close to you may help you gain some perspective. People tend to trust those they are closest to, so you may be more likely to consider a differing perspective from your best friend rather than someone you don’t know. For instance, if you are trying to form an opinion on healthcare laws, ask your friends and family what their experience with the healthcare system has been. Based on their experiences, you may be able to see areas where the law works and you support it; or areas where it doesn’t work and has room for improvement. Often times, though, your friend’s perspectives may align with your already-established beliefs, as we tend to surround ourselves with like-minded people. So try not to rely too heavily on the opinions of your like-minded friends and family. Doing so can limit your exposure to other valuable ideas and perspectives. If anything, these discussions may give you another way of looking at a situation and/or more reasons to support your opinion. This is particularly useful for topics that you have very little or no experience in. For instance, if you have a preconceived notion that people in a particular culture, or even town, behave a certain way, visit the place to experience their behavior for yourself.

Due to the accident, he becomes emotionally disturbed and undergoes psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont (Ann Mckenzie), making some progress in dealing with the guilt over the accident. To help Max move forward, his father, Jack Matheson (William Katt), reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans and invites Max to replace the security guard, who recently quit under mysterious circumstances while apparently \\"cutting himself up\\" on duty. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager, Keller Landreaux (Lawrence Turner), the buyer, Jenna McCarty (Christy Carlson Romano), and the vice-president of operations, Ryan Parker (Jon Michael Davis). Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror, and then sees Jenna's reflection, ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna is killed by her reflection, being thrown through glass doors and a shard of glass decapitating her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost, but instead sees Ryan's reflection being eviscerated. He tries to contact Ryan, but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed, in the same way as his reflection. Max sees his father's face covered in cuts in a puddle then races to his father's house. Jack is almost killed by his reflection, after Max made it to his house and hints to whoever is manipulating the mirrors that he would do whatever she wants him to do if she spares his father.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back? Options: - not enough information - because that is what happened to the beautiful model - because that is the only area to do a massage - She had been carrying her children === The correct answer is","completion":"- She had been carrying her children"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: When asked to find the larger circle, _ . Options: A: children at 6 got it wrong 79 % of the time with no gray ones around B: only adults over 18 got it right 95% of the time with gray ones around C: children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around D: adults got it right most of the time with gray ones around Answer:","completion":"C: children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why does mass increase with velocity as an object approaches the speed of light? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: + no; + yes;","completion":"+ no; Okay, let me explain both questions in a simple way! 1. When an object gets closer to the speed of light, its mass increases. This is because of a special rule called \\"relativity.\\" Let's imagine an object is going super fast, almost as fast as light! It starts to feel really heavy and harder to push. The rate at which it gains mass depends on its speed. The closer it gets to the speed of light, the more mass it gains. 2. Now, why does the mass increase as the object gets closer to the speed of light? Let's think of moving as being on a super-fast magic slide. As you go faster, the slide gets more and more slippery and harder to hold on to. That's because the slide wants to make sure you can't go faster than light. The only way to do that is by making things feel heavier and harder to push the faster they move. So, the object's mass increases, and it's all because of that rule called \\"relativity.\\" These two questions are related, but not the same.

Adjusted score: The reviewer had to adjust their rating based on the number of books they have read, which implies that the book did not fare well in comparison to other works they have encountered. 2. Manipulative theme: The reviewer raises concerns about the manipulative theme of the book by Shery Argov, noting that they believe it is contrary to the idea of genuine love. This criticism highlights the reader's core disagreement with the author's approach, and it negatively impacts their overall assessment of the book. 3. False representation of self: The reviewer believes that true love requires a person to be their authentic self, without the need to adopt manipulative or dishonest behavior. They argue that if a woman has to change her personality or act in a way to attract a man, that relationship may not be based on genuine affection and respect. 4. The focus on being a \\"bitch\\": The reviewer is concerned about the book's emphasis on women being \\"bitchy\\" to attract men, suggesting that such behavior is not only undesirable but may even be a sign that the man in question is not suitable for a healthy and loving relationship. 5. The idea of true love: The reviewer emphasizes the importance of true love in a relationship, which they claim is not achievable if one has to employ manipulative tactics or change their inherent personality. This statement suggests that the book's content may not align with the reviewer's values, contributing to the negative nature of the review. In summary, the product review is negative due to the reviewer's disagreements with the manipulative theme, the perceived need to change oneself for love, and the focus on unpleasant behavior to secure a relationship.

Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across Europe. - Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands.

Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. - The Menai Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge to carry road traffic between the island of Anglesey and the mainland of Wales. The bridge was designed by Thomas Telford and completed in 1826 and is a Grade I listed building. - Britannia Bridge is a bridge across the Menai Strait between the island of Anglesey and the mainland of Wales. It was originally designed and built by Robert Stephenson as a tubular bridge of wrought iron rectangular box-section spans for carrying rail traffic. Following a fire in 1970 it was rebuilt, initially as a single tier steel truss arch bridge, carrying rail traffic. A second tier was added later and opened in 1980 to accommodate road traffic. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest.

Article: Scientists have written a report on the future of trade and industry. They talk about the role robots will play in industry. What is a robot?Basically ,it is a machine which is designed to do the work of a human being. It is usually controlled by a computer. Once it has been given a set of things to do,it will do the job on its own. Nowadays,Britain has 120 robots at work in industry. This compares badly with other industrial countries. In Japan,there are 4,000 robots in use. In the USA there are 2,000 and in Germany there are 500. According to the report,the government must help people understand how robot technology can be used. Also,people must be educated to know how important this new technology is. The designing of new robots will be very important in the future. The report says that special robot centres should be set up where people who design robots and people who will use them work together. The assembly work of the future will be complex . So firms must develop robots to do it. Question: The title which best suits this passage is \\" _ \\".

These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: The wildfire in which city is currently less likely to spread? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","completion":"The wildfire in the city of Parth is currently less likely to spread. This is because it is nighttime in Parth while it is daytime in Milton. Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours due to factors such as lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. With sunlight warming the ground, air currents travel uphill, fanning the wildfire and causing it to spread. Since it is nighttime in Parth, the wildfire there is less likely to experience these intensifying factors, making it less prone to spreading as compared to the wildfire in Milton."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the background: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered.

This song was released in May 1974 and became a major hit worldwide. It serves as a milestone in the development of disco music and laid the foundation for future artists and songs in the genre. \\"Rock Your Baby,\\" which was written and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of KC and the Sunshine Band, quickly rose to the top of the charts and reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. It held the top spot for two consecutive weeks (July 13-27, 1974). The song also reached number 1 in the United Kingdom and across several other countries in Europe. George McCrae, a singer from West Palm Beach, Florida, began his career in the late 1960s, but it wasn't until the release of \\"Rock Your Baby\\" that he achieved international fame. The song, featuring his smooth vocal style and the contagious beat characteristic of disco music, struck a chord with listeners around the world and quickly made McCrae a household name. The song's popularity was boosted by its catchy melody, feel-good lyrics, and innovative production, which featured a drum machine and other electronic elements that would become standard in later disco hits. Many music historians consider \\"Rock Your Baby\\" as one of the first true disco songs, influencing countless artists and shaping the genre's sound throughout the rest of the 1970s and beyond. Despite the enormous success of \\"Rock Your Baby,\\" McCrae's following releases did not have the same impact.

Question: How does the Gunslinger try to track Martin? Title: Westworld Movie plot: It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld.

The United Nations, a group of countries that work together to solve problems and make the world a better place, said that more than 5,000 people are dying in Syria every month. This is a very big number, and it's important for us to know that there are actually more people dying than we can count. That's really sad, and it means many families in Syria are losing their loved ones. It's also important to know that most of these people who are dying are boys and men.

You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX may feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, the feeling is an emotional reaction on the part of X or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, X might feel good about [one]self. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.

For example, \\"PersonX lays PersonY's book upon the table.\\" The \\"___\\" can be replaced with any object attributed to PersonY. The criteria for this part are met because the action is being performed by PersonX, involving an object belonging to PersonY. Part #2: <sep> Usage: The symbol <sep> separates the Head and Tail phrases.

In this part of the definition, it describes a possible emotional reaction that PersonX might feel as a result of the Head event. In this example, \\"in charge\\" represents a feeling that might arise from the Head event. The criteria for this part are met because it provides a potential emotional outcome due to PersonX's action in the Head event. Together, the task involves determining whether the specified emotional reaction (\\"in charge\\") could be reasonably inferred from the Head event (\\"PersonX lays PersonY's ___ upon\\")."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jacqueline Morton's family have sought an adjournment so they can begin action against 58-year-old Harry Clarke. The motion is being backed by relatives of Gillian Ewing. Both women were among the six people who died in the crash on 22 December last year. A decision on whether the inquiry will be halted will be made on Thursday. Erin McQuade, 18, and her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and Lorraine Sweeney, 69, also died in the tragedy. Their lawyer, Mark Stewart QC, said they reserved the right to prosecute anyone found to carry responsibility for the crash. Relatives of a sixth victim, 29-year-old Stephenie Tait, said they would not be involved in any private prosecution. Their lawyer Ronald Conway told the inquiry: \\"Telling lies is not a crime; telling lies to the medical profession is not a crime.\\" The inquiry, now in its fifth week at Glasgow Sheriff Court, will hear from the remaining witnesses before the sheriff makes a decision on the request for an adjournment on Thursday. The inquiry is looking at Mr Clarke's health, the bin lorry and its route. The FAI has previously heard that Mr Clarke was unconscious at the wheel when the Glasgow City Council bin lorry crashed on 22 December last year. The inquiry has also heard that he suffered a previous blackout in 2010 at the wheel of a bus, while employed as a driver for First Bus. In the past four weeks, the FAI has been told that Mr Clarke lied about the circumstances surrounding the 2010 blackout in his council application form, subsequent health assessments and in dealings with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Scotland's Crown Office stated in February that it would not bring criminal proceedings against Mr Clarke over the incident, which it said was a tragic accident. The Crown Office later clarified at the inquiry that this decision stood, even after it had emerged at the FAI that Mr Clarke may have lied about the state of his health to obtain driving jobs. Some families have been highly-critical of the decision not to prosecute Mr Clarke and have stated they would consider a private prosecution against him. On Monday, the first move towards a private prosecution began at the inquiry. In Scotland, prosecutions are normally brought by the Lord Advocate, who heads the Crown Office. Private prosecutions are extremely unusual, with only two in the 20th Century. To bring one, an individual must apply to the High Court for a \\"Bill of Criminal Letters,\\" which can be opposed by the Lord Advocate - and the alleged offender. If the court grants the application, they have 21 days to lodge answers, after which a hearing is fixed for a later date to decide whether the prosecution can proceed. At each stage there is the possibility of an appeal, which makes the process extremely costly as legal aid would not be available for an individual bringing a case. The last private prosecution was the so-called Carole X case in 1982 in which defence lawyers gave their services pro bono - free of charge. A Glasgow woman prosecuted three men who she claimed had raped her. One was found guilty. The other case was in 1909, and involved a coal company and allegations of fraud. Dorothy Bain QC, acting for the family of Ms Morton, from Glasgow, told Sheriff John Beckett she had been instructed to seek an adjournment in order to seek authority to bring a private prosecution against Mr Clarke. Ms Bain said it could take up to three months to establish whether a private prosecution could proceed. Alistair Forsyth, acting for the bereaved Ewing family, supported Ms Bain's motion. Ronald Conway, representing the Tait family, said they would not be pursuing a private prosecution as the family felt that the inquiry should focus on the \\"systemic failures which have been made plain\\" during the course of evidence. Mr Clarke's advocate, Ronnie Clancy QC, said the driver supported the motion to adjourn, but stressed that he was keen to return to the inquiry to give evidence once the issue of legal proceedings had been resolved. Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC, who is leading the inquiry, said there was a \\"clear public interest\\" in seeing the inquiry through to the sheriff's determination. Sheriff Beckett said that if Mr Clarke was going to be prosecuted then he would have to be given a warning before giving evidence, meaning he may not answer all questions. He also said there would be \\"profound implications\\" in adjourning the inquiry but he would consider the motion and the inquiry would hear the evidence of the other remaining witnesses in the meantime. This means that Mr Clarke, who was expected to begin giving evidence on Tuesday, will not appear until Thursday at the earliest. The inquiry continues. What was that article about?","completion":"Alright, I'll explain the article in simple terms for you! There was a very sad accident where a big trash truck crashed and six people died.

A big meeting, called an inquiry, is happening to figure out everything about the accident. Now, some of the families of the people who died want to stop the inquiry for a little while. They want to try to take Harry Clarke to court themselves. This is called a private prosecution and it's very rare. They will decide on Thursday if they will stop the inquiry or not. The families hope that this will make sure everyone who was responsible for the accident gets in trouble.

Scientists believe the forest could help explain a 15-fold reduction in carbon dioxide levels at the time. Dr Chris Berry said it showed what the landscape was like as \\"the first trees were beginning to appear on Earth\\". The forests, found in Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, grew near the equator during the Devonian period (420 - 360 million years ago). Dr Berry, from Cardiff University's school of earth and ocean science, said: \\"During the Devonian period, it is widely believed that there was a huge drop in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, from 15 times the present amount to something approaching current levels. \\"The evolution of tree-sized vegetation is the most likely cause of this dramatic drop in carbon dioxide because the plants were absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis to build their tissues and also through the process of forming soils.\\" The team found forests were mainly formed of lycopod trees, which grew about 20cm (8in) apart from one another and reached 4m (13ft) in height. During the Devonian period, Svalbard was located on the equator before tectonic plates shifted and it moved to its current location. The findings were published in the journal Geology on Thursday.","completion":"Scientists found an old forest in Norway with tree stumps, and this forest might help explain why there was less carbon dioxide on Earth a long, long time ago when the first trees started to grow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Miss Anderson dined out, and preferred to suppose that she had no time to think until she was on her way home along the empty road round Jakko at eleven o'clock that night. Then it pleased her to get out of her rickshaw and walk. There was an opulent moon, the vast hills curving down to the plains were all grey and silvery, and the deodars overhead fretted the road with dramatic shadows. About her hung the great stillness in a mighty loneliness in which little Simla is set, and it freed her from what had happened, so that she could look at it and cry out. She actually did speak, pausing in the little pavilion on the road where the nursemaids gather in the daytime, but very low, so that her words fell round her even in that silence, and hardly a deodar was aware. 'I will not go now,' she said. 'I will stay and realize that he is another woman's husband. That should cure me if anything will--to see him surrounded by the commonplaces of married life, that kind of married life. I will stay till she comes and a fortnight after. Besides, I want to see her--I want to see how far she comes short.' She was silent for a moment, and the moonlight played upon her smile of quiet triumph. 'He cares too,' she said; 'he cares too, but he doesn't know it, and I promise you one thing, Madeline Anderson, you won't help him to find out.

She had always loved Christmas and shared a special bond with her aunt Clarissa, who would visit every year during the holiday season. Aunt Clarissa, a talented musician, brings joy and the spirit of Christmas through her melodic tunes that resonated throughout Jinglewood. Tragically, Aunt Clarissa passed away during the previous year, leaving Lara heartbroken and uncertain about the future of their Christmas tradition. As Christmas approaches, Lara is overwhelmed with nostalgia, missing her aunt more than ever. One day, while going through her late aunt's belongings, she discovers something extraordinary. It's Aunt Clarissa's clarinet! Wrapped in a worn-out velvet case with a handwritten note that reads, \\"To my dear Lara, may the magic of music fill your heart and soul. With love, Aunt Clarissa.\\" On Christmas morning, Lara slowly unwraps the gift, feeling the heartache that came with her aunt's absence. Holding the clarinet close to her chest, Lara feels a sudden surge of energy and warmth. It's as if the clarinet has a magical power that connects her to her beloved aunt. Unsure of what to make of this unexpected gift, Lara begins to explore the instrument, slowly recalling the melodies Clarissa once played. As days pass, Lara practices the clarinet with newfound determination. Word spreads throughout Jinglewood about the young girl who awakened the spirit of Christmas with her music. Facing her grief head-on, Lara organizes a Christmas concert in memory of her aunt, inviting all of Jinglewood's residents to attend. When the concert day arrives, the streets of Jinglewood are filled with colorful lights, a festive atmosphere, and the aroma of freshly baked gingerbread cookies. As night falls, excited chatter fills the air as people gather in the town square, preparing to witness the magic of Lara's music. Under the twinkling stars, Lara stands on stage, looking out at the sea of faces gathered for the show. The wind softly blows through the branches of the Christmas tree, and for a moment, she could feel Aunt Clarissa's presence beside her, giving her the strength and encouragement she needs. With a deep breath, Lara plays her clarinet, and as she does, the town is enveloped in an enchanting melody that captivates the hearts of everyone there. The sounds of the clarinet dance through the air, snowflakes swirl, lighting up in different colors as they glide around, creating a mesmerizing spectacle, unlike anything Jinglewood had ever witnessed. The magic of Lara's clarinet brought Aunt Clarissa's memory to life, making her presence tangible and filling the hearts of Jinglewood's residents with pure Christmas joy. Tears fill Lara's eyes, and as her final note lingers in the chilly night air, she glances up at the heavens above, whispering her profound love and gratitude for Clarissa's gift. In Jinglewood, a legend is born—Aunt Clarissa's spirit is said to live within the clarinet, spreading love and joy through music. Lara's journey with the magical clarinet builds a new Christmas tradition for her and the town, an annual Christmas concert dedicated to Aunt Clarissa, and filled with the endless magic that lies within the notes of their favorite holiday melodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Inside Job Movie plot: The documentary is split into five parts. It begins by examining how Iceland was highly deregulated in 2000 and the privatization of its banks. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and AIG collapsed, Iceland and the rest of the world went into a global recession. Part I: How We Got Here[edit] The American financial industry was regulated from 1940 to 1980, followed by a long period of deregulation. At the end of the 1980s, a savings and loan crisis cost taxpayers about 124 billion. In the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few giant firms. In March 2000, the Internet Stock Bubble burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies that they knew would fail, resulting in 5 trillion in investor losses. In the 1990s, derivatives became popular in the industry and added instability. Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, backed by several key officials. In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns), two financial conglomerates (Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase), three securitized insurance companies (AIG, MBIA, AMBAC) and the three rating agencies (Moodyâs, Standard &amp; Poor's, Fitch). Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which they sold to investors. Rating agencies gave many CDOs AAA ratings. Subprime loans led to predatory lending. Many home owners were given loans they could never repay. Part II: The Bubble (2001â2007)[edit] During the housing boom, the ratio of money borrowed by an investment bank versus the bank's own assets reached unprecedented levels. The credit default swap (CDS), was akin to an insurance policy. Speculators could buy CDSs to bet against CDOs they did not own. Numerous CDOs were backed by subprime mortgages. Goldman-Sachs sold more than 3 billion worth of CDOs in the first half of 2006. Goldman also bet against the low-value CDOs,...

The band consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are fictional and are not personas of any \\"real life\\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons. Context: Musician Damon Albarn and comic book artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \\"arsey, a wanker\\"; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica. The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, \\"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell - there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that.\\" The band originally identified themselves as \\"Gorilla\\" and the first song they recorded was \\"Ghost Train\\" which was later released as a B-side on their single \\"Rock the House\\" and the B-side compilation G Sides. The musicians behind Gorillaz' first incarnation included Albarn, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator and Kid Koala, who had previously worked together on the track \\"Time Keeps on Slipping\\" for Deltron 3030's eponymous debut album. Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that \\"one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes\\" was Blur's 1997 single \\"On Your Own\\", which was released for their fifth studio album Blur. Question: were they together?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett were together in creating the Gorillaz. They became friends and started living together in a flat in London. They came up with the idea of creating a cartoon band called Gorillaz, which is a mix of music and animation. The band has fictional characters named 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs, and they work with different musicians to make their songs.

I couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues: his lover moves out and Gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the film, but I will tell you this: it is quite predictable.

Collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses. Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hell, I think she might pull off getting a Best Supporting Actress nod for this one if the script were a little better).

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge.

These levees help to prevent further flooding by acting as a barrier between the river and the surrounding land. So, the correct answer is (1). No."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less air enters bronchioles, less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels happens, how will it affect LESS babies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is related to the respiratory system and oxygen supply. If less air enters the bronchioles and less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels, it can have indirect effects on the overall process of human development. In the context of fewer babies being born, the specific hypothesis might not have a direct effect on the process of reproduction itself. However, the underlying causes of this decrease in air and oxygen supply to bronchioles could have broader implications for human health and fertility. Some possible reasons for such oxygen limitations could be related to air pollution, congenital defects, or respiratory diseases. Here are some ways in which this perturbation can indirectly affect the process of human development and result in fewer babies being born: 1. Overall Health: A decreased oxygen supply can impact the overall health and well-being of individuals, making them more susceptible to health issues that could affect their ability to conceive. For example, if a couple is struggling with respiratory issues, hence experiencing a lack of oxygen, chronic stress could weaken their immune system, making it harder for them to conceive. 2. Fertility: Lower oxygen levels in the blood could potentially lead to reproductive issues, as optimal oxygen supply is necessary for the proper functioning of reproductive organs in both males and females. For instance, low oxygen levels could contribute to poor sperm quality in males, making it more difficult to achieve conception. 3. Pregnancy Complications: Insufficient oxygen supply to the fetus during pregnancy can result in complications, such as low birth weight, preterm labor, or restricted fetal growth. In turn, this could lead to an increase in infant mortality, thereby affecting the number of babies born. 4. Environmental Factors: If the main cause of decreased air and oxygen supply is due to significant environmental pollution, this can indirectly impact multiple aspects of human life, including the birth rate. Pollution may lead to higher incidences of infertility, miscarriages, and other adverse health outcomes that affect the number of babies being born. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis of less air entering bronchioles and less oxygen being absorbed by blood vessels does not directly influence the number of babies born, it can indirectly contribute to a decrease in birth rate through various health and environmental factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured.

Bradley is mainly recognized as an esteemed bishop, a title represented in the image labeled as \\"bishop denis mary bradley.jpg\\".

Being a bishop typically denotes a leadership role within the Christian Church; often being responsible for overseeing church affairs, leading services, and offering guidance to congregation members. Bishop Bradley would have played a crucial part in these tasks, providing teachings, advice or even participating in church expansions and initiatives during his tenure.

But instead of fond. memories, Leonard was yesterday left shamed and beginning a prison. sentence in the aftermath of a drunken assault in which she bit another. woman’s face. The savage unprovoked attack has left her victim, Carol. McAndrew, 49, scarred for life. A. court heard how Leonard punched Mrs McAndrew to the floor and bit her. on the cheek, removing a chunk of flesh and leaving her needing 15. stitches. This week a judge jailed Leonard for 27 months for the attack, which took place last June.

But Leonard failed to return to the coach promptly at the end of the day, causing the 130-mile journey home to be delayed. Birmingham. Crown Court heard that when Leonard did eventually appear, the coach. set off but she became ‘aggressive and foul-mouthed’ and a row broke. out. Prosecutor Alexander Davies said that Leonard approached Mrs McAndrew and asked: ‘Have you got a problem with me?’ Mrs McAndrew decided to get off the bus early and phoned her husband to come and pick her up. Leonard launched the attack after being 'aggressive and foul-mouthed' on the bus back to Birmingham from a day at the races, the court heard. However,. Leonard followed her off the vehicle and attacked her on the pavement. ‘The defendant grabbed her by her hair and punched her several times in. the face,’ Mr Davies said. ‘She. was knocked to the floor and the defendant was on top of her and bit. her hard to the left side of her face.’ The bus driver had to drag.

The attack happened after the women had been on a coach trip to Ladies Day at Ascot racecourse (file picture) ‘You were told. to behave yourself but you did not heed the warning.

In paraphrasing, the meaning of the text should remain the same while changing the sentence structure or words, which is not the case here. Let's break it down: 1. The first sentence suggests that Naa Bolinaa Saaka is a Ghanaian diplomat and a member of the New Patriotic Party of Burkina Faso and is currently an ambassador of Ghana in Ghana. This sentence is somewhat confusing since it implies that Naa Bolinaa Saaka is an ambassador to her own country (Ghana). Furthermore, it is stated that she is a member of the New Patriotic Party of Burkina Faso. This is not logical; as it is more common that a Ghanaian diplomat would be associated with a political party in their own country rather than in another. 2. The second sentence indicates that Naa Bolinaa Saaka is a Ghanaian diplomat and a member of the New Patriotic Party of Ghana, currently serving as the Ghanaian Ambassador to Burkina Faso. This sentence makes more sense. It is logical for a Ghanaian diplomat to be a member of a Ghanaian political party and for them to serve as an ambassador to another country (in this case, Burkina Faso). Not only does the second sentence make more reasonable assumptions, but it also contains differing information than the first. Therefore, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other, as they deliver different information about the party affiliation and ambassadorship of Naa Bolinaa Saaka. A correct paraphrase of the second sentence might look something like this: \\"Serving as the current Ambassador to Burkina Faso, Naa Bolinaa Saaka, a Ghanaian diplomat, is a member of Ghana's New Patriotic Party.\\" This sentence maintains the same meaning as the second sentence, but changes the sentence structure and wording."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" Hypothesis: Honky Tonk disappeared after the 50s","completion":"After reading the given paragraph and analyzing the information provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis stating that \\"Honky Tonk disappeared after the 50s\\" is not entirely true. The paragraph suggests that the Nashville sound replaced the chart dominance of honky tonk music, but it does not imply that honky tonk music disappeared altogether. The Nashville sound emerged in the mid-1950s as a subgenre of American country music, aiming to revitalize the country sales affected by the rise of rock 'n' roll. This new sound introduced smoother elements like strings, choruses, sophisticated background vocals, and smoother tempos, thus changing the landscape of country music. It is evident that the Nashville sound contributed to a significant shift in the popularity of honky tonk music, as it offered a more contemporary and polished style that resonated with a broader audience. Consequently, honky tonk music lost its dominance in the music charts. However, it is important to note that losing chart dominance does not equate to the complete disappearance of honky tonk music. Even though the Nashville sound changed the musical preferences of the masses and influenced the direction of country music, honky tonk music continued to be produced and enjoyed by a certain section of the audience. Additionally, honky tonk's influence can still be found in contemporary country music artists and songs, testifying to its continuous presence. In conclusion, the hypothesis of honky tonk music disappearing after the 50s is not accurate. While it is true that honky tonk music lost its chart dominance due to the emergence of the Nashville sound, it did not vanish completely. Instead, its influence persisted, shaping the sound and style of subsequent generations of country music artists."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: The 34 players were banned for two years after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) upheld a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) appeal in January. The players were injected with a banned performance-enhancing drug in 2012. The SFT ruled that, as the players earlier accepted the ruling, they \\"had lost their right to challenge\\" it. However, Cas said the SFT ruled it would have upheld the ban regardless of whether it was \\"properly challenged\\". As some of the players accepted provisional suspensions in 2013, the bans were backdated, meaning most will be eligible to return for the 2017 Australian Football League season. At the time, Essendon received a record A2m (£1.2m) fine, were barred from end-of-season finals and had their coach and manager suspended. The banned drug was peptide Thymosin Beta 4 (TB-4), which promotes muscle growth. Cas said the programme was designed to \\"improve players' recovery from intense workouts and thereby allow them to become bigger and stronger\\". Many of those involved have since left the sport, although 16 players remain in the AFL system. In January, Wada director general David Howman said the ban \\"represents justice for clean athletes in Australia and worldwide\\". Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency (Asada) chief executive Ben McDevitt added: \\"At best, the players did not ask the questions they should have. At worst, they were complicit in a culture of secrecy and concealment.\\" Jobe Watson, former Essendon captain and winner of the 2012 Brownlow Medal, returned to training in September.

Step 1: Determine the setting and time period The movie will be set in a prestigious opera house in a bustling city during the 1950s. The atmosphere embodies the elegance, glamour, and mystery of that era. Step 2: Introduce the main character, Betty Betty is a talented, young opera singer who has a passion for the stage. She is about to make her big debut, and everyone in the industry is talking about her powerful voice and enchanting stage presence. However, unknown to most, she is also a keen amateur detective. Step 3: Outline the central murder mystery During one of Betty's highly anticipated performances, a high-profile business tycoon is found murdered in his private opera box. The murder creates a sensation and tension begins to rise within the opera house. As the police investigate the crime scene, their list of suspects begins to grow. Step 4: Develop the suspect list The suspects include a jealous rival singer, an ex-lover, a vengeful business partner, and even a mysterious stranger. Each suspect has a motive and a dark secret, and they all seem to be hiding something. The police dig into each suspect's past, trying to uncover the truth. Step 5: Betty's involvement in solving the mystery As the police investigation continues, Betty decides to use her intelligence, intuition, and knowledge of the opera house to uncover the truth. She begins her own investigation, and as the debut performance approaches, she finds herself getting closer to the killer. Step 6: Introduce plot twists As Betty uncovers unsettling information about the suspects, it becomes apparent that there is much more to the murder than meets the eye. Perhaps the business tycoon had ties to organized crime, or he was involved in a love triangle. Each new reveal brings Betty closer to the truth while putting her own life at risk. Step 7: Climax and reveal of the murderer In a thrilling climax, Betty takes the stage for her debut performance, and the tension in the opera house reaches its peak. During the final act, Betty cleverly manages to reveal the identity of the murderer using a cleverly disguised clue in her performance. The police arrest the murderer, but not before a thrilling chase through the backstage corridors. Step 8: Resolution and character growth Following the resolution of the murder, Betty's career as an opera singer takes off, and she gains fame and acclaim for her performances.

I'll conduct research on \\"com.termux\\" by searching for information online, looking at user reviews, and testing the app if possible. From my research, I found that Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment app for Android. It allows users to run scripts, use Git, install packages, and have a fully functional Linux environment at their fingertips. Step 2: Consider the target audience The target audience for this app includes developers, IT professionals, and individuals who are interested in Linux and command-line interfaces on Android devices. Keeping this audience in mind ensures that the review addresses the needs and expectations of potential users. Step 3: Identify the app's strengths and weaknesses Now that I understand the app, I'll identify several key strengths and weaknesses to help craft a balanced and fair 4-star review. A 4-star review should indicate overall satisfaction with the app, but also mention some areas for improvement or caution users about potential issues. Strengths: - Access to a functional Linux environment on an Android device - Ability to run scripts and use Git - Package management system for easy installation of necessary tools and libraries Weaknesses: - A learning curve for users unfamiliar with the terminal environment - Some occasional instability, leading to crashes - Certain incompatibilities or limitations with running some packages Step 4: Write the 4-star review After identifying the strengths and weaknesses, I'll now craft a 4-star review addressing the target audience, highlighting the app's strengths, and mentioning areas for improvements. Review: Title: \\"Termux - A Powerful Tool with a Learning Curve\\" I've been using Termux for a few months now, and it has been a game-changer in terms of productivity on my Android device. The ability to run scripts, use Git, and install various packages through the built-in package manager makes it an invaluable tool for developers and IT professionals alike. However, there is a bit of a learning curve for those not familiar with the terminal environment. It may take some time to get used to its interface and commands, but once you're comfortable with it, the possibilities are endless. I did experience a few instances of instability that led to crashes, but these occurrences were relatively rare. Another note to keep in mind is that some packages might not run perfectly on the Android platform, so be prepared for occasional compatibility issues. Overall, I give Termux 4 out of 5 stars – a powerful tool for developers and individuals interested in bringing Linux capabilities to their Android devices, but with some room for improvement in stability and ease of use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who claimed to MTV that \\"someone at that studio helped themselves to a copy and, after eight months, it made its way to an Italian website\\" while describing the peer-to-peer filesharing leak? Answer the above question based on the context below: On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\"). According to Morello, the songs were unfinished and, in some cases, \\"weren't even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind.\\" To MTV, he described them as \\"inferior sketches of works-in-progress, sent to Seattle for Chris to work on. Someone at that studio helped themselves to a copy and, after eight months, it made its way to an Italian website. Then it went global and everyone thought they had the record, which was so frustrating.\\" Answer:","completion":"The person who made the claim to MTV about the leak of the 13 rough mixes of songs to an Italian website is Tom Morello, the guitarist of Audioslave. He stated that the leaked songs were \\"inferior sketches of works-in-progress\\" and not the final versions of the tracks."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

If the Chinese are associated with the Long March in the 20th century, who are associated with the Great Trek in Africa in the 19th century????","completion":"The Great Trek in Africa during the 19th century is primarily associated with the Boers, descendants of Dutch settlers who migrated with their families and livestock from the British-controlled Cape Colony to the interior regions of what are now South Africa and Namibia. The Boers were mainly farmers of Dutch, French Huguenot, and German descent. The Great Trek began between 1835 and 1840, and it was triggered by several factors. The British colonial administration had taken control of the Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1806. Over the years, the Boers experienced mounting frustration with British rule, as the colonial government sought to impose its policies on diverse areas, such as language, lifestyle, religion, and land ownership. Here are some of the contributing factors that led the Boers to embark on the Great Trek: 1. Land and Economic Disputes: The British had introduced economic reforms to modernize the Cape Colony, including land registration policies that disregarded traditional Boer approaches to land management. They also levied taxes on essential items the Boers depended on, such as tools and seeds. This heightened economic pressure on Boer farmers and propelled their discontent. 2. Political and Cultural Differences: The Boer settlers adhered to a distinct cultural identity, with their language (Afrikaans), religion (mainly Dutch Reformed Church), and social values differing from those of the British. The British tried to impose their language, lifestyle, and values on the colony, which the Boers viewed as a serious encroachment on their cultural freedom. 3. Abolition of Slavery: The British abolished slavery in the Cape Colony in 1834. The resulting loss of labor made it more difficult for Boer farmers to maintain their agricultural livelihoods. Although some Boers did not object to the abolition itself, they were upset with the way the British government compensated them for the loss of their slaves. 4. Conflicts with Indigenous Peoples: The Boers frequently clashed with the local indigenous populations, such as the Xhosa and the Zulus, over land-related disputes and differing ways of life. The British colonial administration's reluctance to support the Boers in these conflicts further intensified their desire to move away from British-controlled territories. During the Great Trek, around 12,000 to 14,000 Boers, known as Voortrekkers (or pioneers), divided into several groups, with each group led by a different leader, including Piet Retief, Andries Pretorius, and Hendrik Potgieter. These migrations involved facing numerous challenges and hardships, such as traversing rugged terrain, enduring harsh weather conditions, and fighting multiple conflicts against local African tribes and British forces. The Great Trek resulted in the establishment of several Boer Republics, namely the Transvaal Republic or South African Republic, the Orange Free State (present-day Free State Province), and the Natalia Republic. These republics would go on to play a significant role in shaping the political landscape of South Africa, eventually culminating in the Anglo-Boer Wars (or South African Wars) from 1880-1881 and 1899-1902. The legacy of the Great Trek is still apparent today, as it is viewed as a foundational event in the development of Afrikaner nationalism and identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Alexander earned the epithet \\"The Great\\" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king. In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians. At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again. When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. <sep>Why was Alexander considered a military leader of unparalleled success?<sep>He never lost a battle A:","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes.

Summarize this article: Collect approximately 100mL (.44 cups) of hot water. The water doesn't need to be boiling. Tap water will work fine. Just leave the tap on for a minute until the water is very hot. To get the purest crystals, begin with a hot solution and allow it to cool slowly by leaving it at room temperature. This slow process will allow the crystal to reject any impurities as the molecules are arranged. The solution will be saturated when it can no longer dissolve more crystals. You will probably need about 60 grams (2.1oz.) of chemical. Add more until the crystal no longer dissolve. There are a number of chemicals you can select depending on the color of crystal you want to make. Some of the chemicals, like borax, may be around your house or at the local grocery store. Other ingredients are available to order online. Borax can be used to produce clear crystals. Copper sulfate can be used to create bright blue crystals. Purple chrome alum can be used to create purple crystals. Pouring the solution through a filter will help to get rid of any excess crystals that could not be dissolved in the solution. Take a plastic funnel and place a coffee filter in the funnel. Then pour the solution into a separate container through the funnel. Now you should have a clear solution with no crystals floating around in the liquid. Leave it for 24 hours. Once you have some small crystals scrape them off the plate with a butter knife. You can use these small crystals as seeds to produce larger crystals. You can poke two small holes in the lid and tie one end around the seed crystal and tie the other end to the top of the jar. The container should be clean so the crystals attach to your seed crystal and not the container. Pick any container that has a good cover that seals. Or make a cover by suspending your crystal from a flat piece of cardboard. Evaporation will help speed up the formation of crystals. Wait as the solution evaporates and your crystal grows larger. Be patient. It can take weeks to grow a large crystal. Keep the object in a cool, shaded area. Make sure it is someplace where the container won't be moved or disturbed too often. Over time, small crystals will begin to form in the solution, so it will be necessary to put your seed crystals into a new container. Remove the seed crystals and place them on a paper towel. Pour the solution through a coffee filter into the new container. Scrape out any crystals in the old container. You can save them and use them as seed crystals for the next time you want to grow a crystal. If you need more solution, dissolve some more crystal powder in hot water and add the solution to your new container. To protect the crystal from being destroyed by exposure to moisture, cover the crystal with a coat of lacquer. Use a brush to apply an even coat over the entire surface. You can also try coating the surface with a layer of nail polish to protect it.","completion":"This article is about making colorful crystals at home. First, you need hot water and some special chemicals like borax, copper sulfate, or purple chrome alum to make different colored crystals. Mix the chemicals in the water until no more crystals can dissolve. To make the crystals pure, let the mixture cool down slowly. Then, pour it through a filter to get a clear liquid without any crystals floating around. Let the liquid sit for a day, then use the small crystals you find to grow bigger ones. It might take weeks for the crystals to grow big, so be patient and don't disturb the container.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"This review would most likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the book and highlights a number of concerns, which can impact your purchasing decision negatively. Firstly, the reviewer expected the book to teach them how to model, but they found that it failed to deliver on this basic expectation. The book seemed to only cover the functionality of the modeler, which they felt could be learned from the manual or figured out independently. This suggests that the book has limited value and may not be sufficient for someone looking to learn modeling skills. Secondly, the reviewer criticizes the examples provided in the book as \\"horrific\\" and questions their relevance. They mention the bending and warping of an airplane using the magnet tool as a specific example of an activity that has no apparent value or application. This further undermines the book's usefulness and can make potential buyers doubt its ability to teach effective modeling techniques. Finally, the reviewer mentions that half of the book is dedicated to advertising third-party plug-ins, implying that the book might not provide a complete solution and could be trying to push additional products onto the readers. This can make potential buyers question the book's motives and whether it is a genuine attempt to provide high-quality instruction or simply a marketing tool aimed at increasing sales of related products. Taking all these factors into consideration, the negative review is likely to discourage potential buyers from purchasing the book, as it raises doubts about its content, usefulness, and overall value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vocabulary and semantics: Among the choices provided - quietness, silent, quite, silence, and music - quietness is the most fitting term to describe the low level of noise in the environment. Comparatively, \\"silence\\" and \\"silent\\" refer to the complete absence of sound, while \\"quietness\\" denotes a more subdued, low volume, which complements the softly hummed hymn. 3. Grammar: In the context of the question, a noun is required to fill the blank. Among the given choices, \\"quietness\\" and \\"silence\\" are the only nouns. As previously mentioned, \\"silence\\" would imply a complete absence of sound, which contradicts the humming of the hymn. Therefore, \\"quietness\\" is the suitable choice. 4. Compatibility: \\"Quietness\\" forms a better semantic relationship with the other elements of the sentence when compared to the rest of the choices. It creates a gentle, calm scene where even minor sounds are noticeable due to the overall low noise level. This fits well with the image of people softly humming a hymn. In contrast, \\"music\\" typically implies a higher volume and more organized sound, which would not fit with the amplification of small noises. In conclusion, the rationale for selecting \\"quietness\\" as the answer is based on its compatibility with the context described in the sentence, its appropriate semantic relationship with the other elements, its precise denotation as a noun, and its suitability as the most accurate term to describe the low noise level during the softly hummed hymn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A married middle school teacher was given a long seven-year prison sentence on Monday, after admitting to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students. Sarah Raymo, 32, was arrested last January after rumors started swirling around Bay City, Michigan's T.L. Handy Middle School that she was sleeping with one of her eighth-grade students. The unidentified victim testified eight months ago that he had sex with Raymo six to eight times, both in school and at her home. The teacher, who appears to have been married at the time of her arrest early this year, was set to go to trial in late September, but instead took a plea deal and admitted guilt to two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct to have four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct dropped. Sentenced: Sarah Raymo was sentenced to 7.5 - 15 years in prison on Monday, after admitting to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students. Pictured above in Bay County Court on November 10. Tearing up: The judge gave Raymo a penalty on the high-end of the sentencing spectrum due to the 'horrendous' nature of her crime. Pictured above in court on November 10. Former school: Raymo was a teacher at T.L. Handy Middle School in Bay City, Michigan last January when she was arrested. On Monday, a circuit court judge sentenced Raymo to 7.5 to 15 years in prison calling her inappropriate relationship with a minor student 'horrendous'. The maximum prison term for the charges is 15 years in prison. As she received her sentence, Raymo started shaking and breathing heavily, while wiping away tears, MLive.com reported. She declined to make a statement. Arrest: The unidentified 14-year-old student said he had sex with Raymo (pictured in January) six to eight times either in her classroom or at her home. 'As a teacher, you're placed in a position of trust over your students,' Circuit Court Judge Kenneth W Schmidt said. 'That trust was violated when you elected to freely and willingly have sex with one of your students, no matter what the circumstances were surrounding your acceptance of the fact that you were going to have sex with this young man. The victim has been greatly impacted by this. He switched schools and is seeking therapy. 'Taking everything into consideration and including the fact that you violated the trust placed in you as a teacher of students, particularly the age of these students — we're talking about eighth grade — the higher end of the guidelines is appropriate,' judge Schmidt added. However, Raymo's defense attorney Matthew Reyes believes the judge made a mistake in the sentencing. 'It's just wrong. I don't feel the judge knows the file like I do,' Reyes said. 'She's probably not ready for what's ahead.' Reyes agrees that what his client did is wrong, but he doesn't see her actions as predatory behavior. In a statement, Reyes explained that while the victim could not consent to sex with Raymo because of his age, he did initiate the relationship with letters of a sexual nature. The victim allegedly started speaking to his teacher through classroom journals, which then transitioned to a text message conversation. After that, Raymo asked the student to stay after school one day and then the two had sex in her classroom. The relationship was exposed when the student started telling fiends about the affair and it spread around school. Head down: As she received her sentence on Monday, Raymo shook and cried. Pictured above in court on Monday. 'I acknowledge that the victim is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, but the victim is not incapable of initiating sexual conversations,' Reyes said. The parents of the victim did not attend the sentencing hearing, but Chief Assistant Prosecutor Nancy E Borushki read a prepared statement on their behalf. 'What is very clear to the parents of the victim and to myself is that this is somebody who took advantage of their child. There has been much said out there about how lucky the victim is, and that this is not a big deal, but this is a big deal to not only the victim, but also his parents,' the statement read. 'This crime is a crime of selfishness and a betrayal of trust... she used a student and she used a child to satisfy whatever selfish needs or issues that she was trying to address. I think it's important not only to the parents, but to the victim in this case, and the community at large that when you betray trust in this fashion that there should be a severe penalty.' According to an online wedding registry on the site TheKnot, Dominowski married Christopher Raymo in September 2012 in Essexville. The woman's husband and mother appeared at her arraignment in January, but it's unclear if she is still married to her husband.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Brendan Rodgers spoke slowly and quietly to add weight to his words. Mario Balotelli’s name had just been brought into the conversation and Liverpool’s manager had a message to broadcast. ‘I think in terms of goals, he needs to improve,’ Rodgers said. ‘It is as simple as that. Any striker — not just him — is judged on his goals and the number of assists he makes. At this moment, he has not hit the numbers he will have wanted.’ During a day when he had to confront a number of issues, from Daniel Sturridge’s fitness to Liverpool’s soft underbelly, nothing resonated louder in the aftermath of a potentially fatal defeat to Basle than the words that were reserved for the £16million man who arrived from AC Milan. Mario Balotelli reacts during Liverpool's 1-0 Champions League defeat in Basle on Wednesday. Mario Balotelli was frustrated all evening in Switzerland and never had a touch in Basle's box. Whatever honeymoon Balotelli had been enjoying at Liverpool is over after his wretched personal performance in St Jakob-Park, where he barely looked interested and rarely threatened to break into anything more taxing than a canter. One goal so far is not a sufficient return. It would be unfair to dump all that is currently wrong at Liverpool at Balotelli’s door — their problems run deeper than a misfiring centre forward — but his static, stuttering displays are exacerbating the situation and, five weeks into his Liverpool career, he has a decision to make. Is he prepared to put in the hard yards? Is he going to do what Rodgers expects of all his strikers, to hassle and harass defenders to the point of distraction? Will he become the focal point of Liverpool’s team and lead their charge, ramping up the intensity with his runs into channels? Brendan Rodgers and Mario Balotelli in training at Liverpool's Melwood base on Thursday. Steven Gerrard and Mario Balotelli train for Liverpool on Thursday at Melwood. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers watches his team train on Thursday after returning from Switzerland. None of that looked likely in Basle. Flouncing off the pitch at the final whistle without acknowledging the travelling supporters, he was the only member of Liverpool’s squad to be escorted back to the team coach and the only one to have something else on aside from an official club tracksuit. Aside from a glistening diamond in each ear, Balotelli was wearing an oversized baseball cap, an image that ensured he grabbed attention, but the time has come for him to realise that he has to start making statements on the pitch rather than off it. If Balotelli looks around Liverpool’s dressing room, he will see professionals who live a quiet life, get on with their business conservatively and push themselves to maximise their talent. He has a stage to make a name for himself but, so far, the penny has not fully dropped. ‘In terms of his behaviour since he came into here the boy is consciously trying to work hard at the aspects of the game that we would demand,’ said Rodgers. ‘In terms of the intensity and that work-rate. And over the course of the team that is the same. ‘We need to return to being a team. That has brought us success over the last 18 months. When confidence is a little bit low in the team, it can become more about the individual, but that is not what we are about. We are a team and when we work to that principle we are at our best.’ If that is the case, why did Rodgers sign a player who, as Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher observed, does not have a history of making sacrifices for the team? How have Liverpool slipped so far when the memory of what Luis Suarez was inspiring last season is still fresh? Mario Balotelli's only goal for Liverpool so far came against Ludogorets at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers looked frustrated on the touchline in Basle at his team's showing. ‘I always said it was about availability and affordability of players,’ Rodgers explained. ‘Mario was the one right at the very end who was available for that. I said when he came in there was a calculated risk and it’s something I have to work on to try to make it work for the team. ‘There are very few players who can replace Suarez. Actually, there are no players who can replace Suarez. When you look at the availability of other players during the summer it was something that was difficult for us.’ Rodgers looked at a number of options when Suarez left for Barcelona, including Loic Remy, Radamel Falcao and Karim Benzema, and believes Liverpool did sign a world-class forward in the last window, but the spotlight is now shining to see whether Balotelli prove he is worthy of that description. Liverpool's talisman Luis Suarez left for Barcelona in the summer in a deal worth £75million. Liverpool signed Divock Origi from Lille in the summer for £10m and loaned him back to the French side. ‘It’s no good now, I know, but we took a player in Divock Origi who we believe will be world-class,’ said Rodgers. ‘We will get him (back from Lille, where he is on loan) next summer. Now he is a top player. He has everything — the speed, the profile and so on. ‘But we couldn’t bring him in now and that was unfortunate because he can run in behind, he can keep the ball, press and run but that was part of the deal. There were very few top-class forwards who were available. Mario was a calculated gamble we had to try and work with.’ If it doesn’t pay off, miserable nights such as the one in Basle could become a recurring theme. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

'Somebody. suggested to me maybe that's (because) the daughters don't want to know. if it's him,' said Jorgensen. 'It's kind of like, \\"That was an ugly war. It. was a long time ago. We just want it to go away\\". 'I. don’t know. What would compel you not to want to know if this person is. your biological father?' Scroll Down for Video. Discovery: Special Forces Green Beret Master Sgt. John Hartley Robertson is the subject of a documentary which claims to have found him alive - now revealed as incorrect - 44 years after he supposedly died in Vietnam. Mystery no More: Dang Tan Ngoc (pictured) has been revealed to be an imposter who had repeatedly tried to impersonate a MIA Vietnam veteran. Sgt. Robertson's name is etched along. with 60,000 others onto Washington D.C.'s poignant Vietnam memorial,. but now the documentary questions whether he is actually alive and well. The filmmakers claim to have tracked. him down to south-central Vietnam - where the 76-year-old is unable to. remember his birthday, his American children’s names, or how to speak. English. The makers of 'Unclaimed' say that. the wiry, forgetful man could very well be a missing POW from the. distressing conflict, and that fellow servicemen could 'lose their minds' when they hear the story of how he never returned. home. 'Sgt. Robertson' told Emmy-award winning filmmaker Michael Jorgensen that when his flaming helicopter crashed to the ground during a firefight on a Laos mountaintop, he was captured immediately by North Vietnamese soldiers. Fake? Robertson, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and member of an elite MACV-SOG unit, was listed as Missing In Action in 1968. But a fellow Vietnam vet who claims he has met a man claiming to be him set off a media storm on Tuesday. Out of sight: Dang Tan Ngoc (pictured) claims to be Robertson, but has forgotten how to speak English. 'They locked me up, high in the forest,. in a cage,' he said. 'I was in and out of consciousness from torture and. starvation. The North Vietnamese soldier hit me on the head with a. stick, shouting, \\"American!\\" 'Then he would hit me even harder; I thought. I would die. I never said anything, though they beat and tortured me.' Mr. Robertson said he escaped after four years, hid in the woods and was. found in a field by a woman who nursed him back to health and then. became his wife. He said he borrowed her late husband’s surname and birth date and was registered as a French-Vietnamese resident named Dan Tan Ngoc. The couple then had children but no recorded attempt was made to contact his wife or children back home in America. Search: Vietnam veteran and humanitarian Tom Faunce, pictured, has become obsessed. with proving that the 76-year-old man he has found in Vietnam is indeed. Sgt. John Hartley Robertson. John Hartley Robertson was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 25, 1936, and went by the name of Johnny. He was the third of five children born to John Cheslea and Mildred Robertson. He grew up during World War II, and it was this influence that led him to drop out of high school at 17 so he could get his GED and join the Army, according to the film makers. He went on to join the U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, and was later chosen to join an elite Special Operations Group known as Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG). On May 20, 1968, he was on a mission when his helicopter came under enemy fire and crashed. A full search mission was not possible and he was declared Missing in Action. On April 28, 1976, he was officially declared dead by the military, leaving behind a wife, Wanda Robertson, and two daughters. The documentary follows the quest of. Vietnam veteran Tom Faunce as he seeks to prove that the man he first. heard about in 2008 while on a humanitarian mission was indeed a fellow. serviceman. Fonce. contacted Jorgensen to see if the filmmaker would follow his story to. establish that Robertson was still alive - but at first the director was. cautious. 'The MIA story was pretty unbelievable, pretty grandiose,' he said to the Globe and Mail. 'I was very skeptical.' However, what struck Jorgensen more than the idea a Vietnam veteran could have stayed undetected for 44 years was Faunce's own journey as a soldier, alcoholic and victim of child abuse. Jorgensen said he was inspired by how Faunce would 'go all the way in helping someone he didn't even know.' He added that 'no matter how the story turned out with John, I knew there was just a great \\"once upon a time\\" with Tom.' In Vietnam, Faunce tracked down the man who was locally rumored to be a former American Green Beret who had never returned home. 'Tom went to meet him and was very skeptical, grilled this guy up and down trying to get him to break, to say, \\"Oh, no, I’m just making it up.\\" And he was adamant he was that guy,' Jorgensen told The Toronto Star. Growing up: Robertson is pictured with his older sister Jean, other siblings and their parents. Former life: Robertson's parents, JC and Mildred, are pictured left, while Robertson himself is pictured in uniform in 1955, when he would have been 19 years old, two years after dropping out of school. Soldier: Robertson is pictured left in 1968 - the year he was declared missing after his helicopter crashed. As the director delved further into the bizarre story, he discovered unusual evidence for Robertson's claims. He found that reports existed as early. as 1982 of Robertson's alleged survival, leading him to question why his. family were not contacted to help provide proof. 'Why did the Americans leave him there for all those years?' Jorgensen asked The Globe and Mail. 'Are there other John Hartley Robertson's in Vietnam?' Jorgensen answered his own question, adding 'a highly-placed source has told him there are and it's not because the Vietnamese won't let them go, it's more the U.S. Military doesn't want them to come home'. Indeed, Jorgensen said that the U.S. government. first became aware of the man as early as 1991, and tried to verify his. identity in 2006. The team discovered that in 2010 Robertson was fingerprinted at the U.S. Embassy. His siblings were never informed. Faunce was reportedly told that there was not enough proof to confirm this was John Hartley Robertson - to which they replied that there was not enough evidence to suggest he wasn't. As the film proceeds, stronger personal reunions add to the case that the elderly man who seems to suffer from dementia is indeed the American special forces solider. Jean Robertson Holley, said she will not have a DNA test as she knows it's him. Younger years: Jean and her younger brother are pictured center while growing up in Alabama. There is a tearful reunion with a soldier who Robertson trained in 1960 - who claims he knew it was him on sight. And. there is a moving moment when the man is brought back together with his sister,. 80-year-old Jean Robertson Holly, at her home in Canada - who would have. been Sgt. Robertson's only surviving sister. 'Jean. says... \\"There’s no question. I was certain it was him in the video, but. when I held his head in my hands and looked in his eyes, there was no. question that was my brother\\",' Jorgensen told the Toronto Star. This could be confirmed if Robertson-Holly agreed to DNA. testing, but she said she does not need to take the test to know the man is her brother. Jorgensen recruited a Vietnamese speaking police officer from Edmonton to act as a translator. At work: Cinematographer Allan Leader and filmmaker Michael Jorgensen pictured in Vietnam in 2012. Film: Jorgensen's film, Unclaimed, will be showed at Toronto's Hot Doc's festival on Tuesday evening. Questions: Faunce walks along the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington D.C. The translator, Hugh. Tran, said that the elderly man spoke just like a Vietnamese native with no trace of. an American accent - leading him to become very suspicious. 'I still didn’t believe... until I saw the family reunion,' said Tran about the emotional meeting with his sister. Other moments made Jorgensen believe they had the right man. At the family reunion, Robertson also met his sister's husband, Henry, and told him that he remembered him working in a drugstore. Henry did indeed work for as a pharmacist for 15 years. And when shown pictures of his two American daughters, he reportedly cried. Jorgensen said he believes that no matter what viewers take away from the film, which opens on Tuesday at the Toronto Hot Docs festival, the man who claims to Robertson fulfilled his wish: to see some of his American family before he dies. Heroes: American flags stand at the base of a statue of American Soldiers of the Vietnam War in D.C. Hot Docs director Chris McDonald,. said he had never seen an audience react with so much emotion after. seeing the film of Mr Robertson's life. He. said: 'Everyone was wobbly and teary - and curious. If this individual. is a legitimate MIA left behind, as the family and filmmakers believe,. it's hard to overestimate what the impact might be.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"An elderly man in Vietnam claimed to be a US war veteran who was believed to have died in a helicopter crash during a mission in Laos in 1968. The man's two daughters, who he hasn't contacted since his disappearance, refused to take a DNA test to prove his identity. A documentary called \\"Unclaimed\\" followed a Vietnam veteran, Tom Faunce, who tried to confirm that the elderly man was Sgt. John Hartley Robertson, a presumed dead green beret. Despite not remembering his birthday, his children's names, or speaking English, the documentary suggests that this man could be a missing prisoner of war, and emotional reunions with some family members seem to strengthen this theory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is most noted for the sitcoms \\"Father Ted\\", \\"Black Books\\" and \\"The IT Crowd\\". Amongst others, he has also worked on \\"Big Train\\", \\"Count Arthur Strong\\", \\"Brass Eye\\" and \\"The Fast Show\\". - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - \`\` Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep '' is the second episode of the third series of the Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted .

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned. A:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is: The blood rich in nutrients and toxins enters the liver through the hepatic portal vein. So, the complete detailed process would be as follows: 1. The blood rich in nutrients and toxins enters the liver through the hepatic portal vein: After being absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, the nutrients, toxins, and other substances travel to the liver through this specialized vein. The liver acts as a processing center for these substances and plays a crucial role in the regulation of various nutrients as well as the detoxification of harmful elements. 2. The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood: Within the liver, hepatocytes (liver cells) contain numerous enzymes, proteins, and other cellular machinery necessary for the liver's functions. These hepatocytes perform various tasks such as breaking down toxins, metabolizing medications, converting nutrients into more usable forms, and storing some nutrients for later use. 3. The blood is cleaned: As the hepatocytes perform their tasks, the blood flowing through the liver is effectively \\"cleaned\\" of harmful substances, and nutrients are either stored or metabolized for immediate use. The liver also produces bile, which is crucial for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins. 4. Energy is produced: The liver plays a significant role in energy production and metabolism. It stores excess glucose as glycogen and can convert it back to glucose when needed for energy. It also plays a central role in gluconeogenesis, which is the process of producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids and lactate. Additionally, the liver is important for the metabolism of lipids (fats) and proteins, which are other essential sources of energy for the body. 5. The blood leaves the liver cleaned: Once the blood has been detoxified, processed, and treated, it flows out of the liver through the hepatic vein, which eventually merges with the inferior vena cava. The cleaned blood then returns to the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body to supply cells with oxygen and nutrients. By effectively regulating the levels of nutrients and purifying the blood of harmful substances, the liver plays a vital role in maintaining the overall health and well-being of the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, I will illustrate a negative review for a restaurant: Title: Disappointing Dining Experience I had high expectations for this restaurant, given its popularity and rave reviews from friends and online food critics. Unfortunately, my dining experience was a great disappointment, leaving me without any intention of returning. 1. Service: The moment we entered the restaurant, it became evident that the service was not up to par. We had to wait for about 15 minutes before one of the staff members took us to our table, despite having made a reservation prior. Our server never offered any greetings, display of a warm attitude, or recommendations. In addition, placing our orders proved to be a tedious task, as the server appeared distracted and uninterested in listening to our requests. 2. Food Quality: Once our food arrived, we were even more disappointed. The chicken dish I ordered was overcooked and dry, and the vegetables seemed bland and lacked any seasoning or flavor. My friend's steak was cold and chewy, indicating its poor quality and lack of freshness. The presentation of the dishes was also unappealing, showing a lack of attention and care from the kitchen staff. 3. Ambiance: The overall ambiance of the restaurant left much to be desired. The lighting was overly dim, creating a somber atmosphere rather than a comfortable, intimate setting. The background music was monotone and barely audible, which did not contribute to enhancing the dining experience. The tables were placed very close together, making us feel cramped and unable to engage in private conversations. 4. Cleanliness: To further our disappointment, we noticed an overall lack of cleanliness in the restaurant. The silverware and glassware were smudged and had visible water spots, and the tablecloth was stained. The restroom also appeared dirty and poorly maintained, with water puddling on the floor and hand soap dispensers left empty. 5. Value for Money: Given the poor service, low-quality food, substandard ambiance, and worrisome hygiene standards, the restaurant's prices were absolutely not justifiable. It felt as though we were paying for a high-end experience without receiving the expected level of quality in return. In conclusion, my experience at this restaurant was incredibly disappointing. The subpar service, disappointing food quality, lackluster ambiance, and lack of cleanliness force me to give this establishment a negative review. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a fulfilling dining experience and would advise looking for alternative options in the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person made the Grand Tour in his youth? Holkham was built by 1st Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather? , can you please find it? In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925. Answer:","completion":"The person affected by the foggy weather in the article is Gustav Holst.

Johnny Ross works with his brother Pete; both are involved with organized crime, and the mob is after Johnny Ross because he siphoned off 2 million of their money. Johnny escapes a mass of gunmen outside his office, then greets Pete in the garage of their office building. The two exchange brotherly greetings and go on their way - Johnny drives past yet another attempt on his life while Pete telephones his higher-up and tells them that Johnny escaped.Saturday afternoon in San Francisco. A man goes to a hotel and asks the desk clerk for a message for \\"Johnny Ross\\", and seems surprised that no message is there. The man takes a cab and has the driver stop by a phone booth, where the man makes a pair of calls, one of them long-distance. At that point, Sgt. Don Delgetti of the SFPD awakens his partner, Detective Lt. Frank Bullitt, at his apartment. Bullitt has been trying to get some sleep after a case that stretched to 5 AM that morning and grumpily chats with his partner.After showering and getting dressed, Frank Bullitt is driven by Delgetti and another policeman, Sgt. Carl Stanton, to the plush mansion of politician Walter Chalmers, who is entertaining a vast pool of guests at a function. Chalmers tells Frank of a star witness who will testify against the mob - Johnny Ross - and who needs protection through his appearance to testify on Monday morning. Chalmers clearly hopes to use Ross as well as Bullitt to the benefit of his political career, and leaves Frank and his two partners to guard Ross at the Hotel Daniels, a flophouse near an passing highway.Frank, Delgetti, and Stanton meet the man who had inquired about a Johnny Ross letter, and the man is puzzled about Chalmers putting him up in such a cheap hotel. After phoning his boss, Captain Samuel Bennett, Frank arranges three shifts to guard Ross, with Delgetti going first, then Stanton, then Bullitt.Around 1am the following morning Stanton gets a call from the Hotel Daniels front desk claiming that Chalmers...

Polygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse. As this is the very definition of bigamy, it is illegal in the United States. The crime is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense. Polygamy was outlawed federally by the Edmunds Act, and there are laws against the practice in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level, but the practice is considered \`\`against public policy'' and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated.

Question: Information: - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew : ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto . After the fashion in rabbinic circles , Rapoport was known by an acronym \`\` Shir '' , formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name Shelomo Yehuda Rapoport ( Shir literally means \`\` song '' in Hebrew ) - The First Partition of Poland took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\". - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin. - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah.

The rest remains on or just below the surface of the water in the form of a light sheen or weathered tar balls. Much of the remaining oil is \\"being degraded and cleaned up on the shore,\\" said Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It's tough to compare","completion":"environmental disasters because their nature and impact vary so widely. In terms of size and scope, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was certainly one of the largest disasters the United States has ever faced. However, it is important to carefully analyze the impacts of the spill itself and the overall recovery efforts to determine if it can accurately be called \\"the worst.\\" The Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20, 2010, resulting in the deaths of 11 crew members and sending oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. Approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil were released into the Gulf, making it the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. The spill had significant environmental and economic impacts in the region, with a vast array of wildlife and countless livelihoods adversely affected. The spill caused the closure of thousands of square miles of ocean to fishing, resulting in severe financial strain for fishermen and coastal communities. Tourism took a hit as well, with travelers opting to avoid the contaminated beaches. Small businesses suffered while the cleanup continued. The area was already suffering from pre-existing issues, such as coastal erosion and loss of wetlands, making the aftermath of the spill even more challenging to address. The damage done to a broad range of ecosystems cannot be underestimated – wetlands, beaches, estuaries, and the open ocean all suffered from large-scale contamination, leaving marine life, birds, and other organisms struggling to survive. The long-term ecological and economic impacts of the spill are still being studied, and new information continues to emerge about the far-reaching consequences of the incident. Early optimism about oil-dispersing chemicals and other cleanup methods was tempered by concerns about the potential negative side-effects these approaches could have on the environment. Comparing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to other major environmental disasters is not an easy task. Disasters like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989 and the Union Carbide chemical leak in Bhopal, India in 1984 had widely different causes and impacts. The Exxon Valdez spill, while smaller in scale, had a profound impact on the Prince William Sound ecosystem due to the heavy crude oil spilled and the sensitive environment it affected. The Bhopal disaster, on the other hand, resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, with countless more experiencing long-term health effects from exposure to toxic gas. While all of these disasters were tragic and caused significant harm to the environment and human life, the specific context of each event must be considered when determining which was the most severe. While it's true that the Deepwater Horizon spill was the largest accidental marine oil spill in history, other environmental disasters have had more immediate catastrophic impacts on human life, like the Bhopal tragedy. In conclusion, labeling the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as \\"the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced\\" may be accurate when considering the massive scale of the spill and its wide-ranging impacts on the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico. However, one must consider the unique context and specific consequences of other disasters before definitively declaring one the worst. Environmental disasters are complex events and can have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on human life and ecosystems alike, and fully understanding their scope requires taking a holistic look beyond just the numbers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Which are more affected by climate change, tidewater glaciers or other glaciers?\\" Context: \\"Tidewater glaciers are glaciers that terminate in the sea, including most glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. Most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which often results in a tremendous impact as the iceberg strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Tidewater glaciers are generally less affected by climate change than other types of glaciers. However, it is essential to understand the differences between these glacier types and the various factors influencing their response to climate change to better appreciate this distinction. Tidewater glaciers, as explained in the context, are glaciers that terminate in the sea. They are primarily found in areas like Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. The calving process, where pieces of ice break off from the glacier and form icebergs, is a significant characteristic of these glaciers. Calving is influenced by various factors, such as glacier velocity, water depth, fjord geometry, and oceanographic conditions. Tidewater glaciers are known for their centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat, which are less affected by climate change compared to other glaciers. On the other hand, other types of glaciers, such as mountain glaciers (alpine glaciers) and valley glaciers, terminate on land and are mainly found in high mountain regions. These glaciers are more responsive to climate change, particularly changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Several factors make tidewater glaciers less affected by climate change compared to other glaciers: 1. Dynamics and response time: The dynamics of tidewater glaciers are more complex than those of land-terminating glaciers. They are influenced by various factors, including ice flow velocity, water depth, and fjord geometry. Additionally, due to their large size and extent, tidewater glaciers have a longer response time to climate change, which means it takes longer for them to show the effects of changes in temperature or precipitation. 2. Calving: The calving process in tidewater glaciers acts as a buffer against climate change effects. Calving helps regulate the mass balance of these glaciers by compensating for the melting that occurs due to warmer temperatures. While calving itself can be influenced by climate change through impacts on ocean temperature and circulation, it is a complex process that is not solely determined by climate factors. 3. Oceanographic conditions: Tidewater glaciers are influenced by ocean temperatures and circulation patterns, which can both buffer and reinforce climate change impacts. For example, some tidewater glaciers in Greenland have experienced increased melting due to the intrusion of warm ocean waters, while others have remained relatively stable due to local oceanographic conditions. 4. Geometry and topography: The geometry and topography of the fjords surrounding tidewater glaciers play a crucial role in determining their response to climate change. For instance, a deep fjord can accommodate a more significant volume of glaciated ice, potentially acting as a buffer against changes in temperature or precipitation. Conversely, a shallow fjord might result in a tidewater glacier being more sensitive to climate change. Overall, tidewater glaciers are generally less affected by climate change than other types of glaciers due to their complex dynamics, calving processes, and the influence of oceanographic conditions. However, it is important to recognize that these glaciers can still be impacted by climate change, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming or shifts in ocean circulation patterns. Furthermore, climate change impacts on tidewater glaciers can lead to significant consequences for global sea level rise, as the melting of glaciers contributes to the expansion of ocean waters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A power cut has left three fuel storage pools at Japan's tsunami-damaged nuclear plant without fresh cooling water for nearly 24 hours, raising concerns about the fragility of the tsunami-ravaged nuclear plant. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's operator said the temperatures in the pools was within safe limits and would remain so for four days, but the incident has highlighted the problems caused by the continued use of makeshift equipment at the damaged plant. A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said the reactors were not affected by the power outage and said staff were preparing a back-up system in case the repairs did not fix the problem. New aerial photo of the Fukushima plant shows the reactor buildings that were damaged by the 2011 tsunami. Masayuki Ono said: 'If the worst comes to the worst, we have a backup water injection system.' The command centre at the plant suffered a brief power failure just before 7pm local time (10am GMT) yesterday, knocking out the cooling facilities for four fuel ponds. Electricity was quickly restored to the command centre, and by Tuesday afternoon (this morning, London time) the cooling system had been restored at one of the pools, but three - the pools in reactors 1, 3 and 4, were still broken at 6pm in Japan (9am GMT). Having investigated the cause of the power cut, the company concluded that it might be due to problems with each of the switchboards for the pools., and began to prepare spare switchboards for use if it could not fix the original ones. TEPCO said that while the temperature in the affected pools had risen slightly, it was still well below the target control temperature. It said the reactors were unaffected and no other abnormalities were found. This image from 2011 shows a spent fuel storage pool at one of the damaged reactors in the power plant. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat. Since then, the plant is now using makeshift systems. This latest incident is a major test for TEPCO to see if it has learned anything from 2011's disaster. TEPCO, which has been accused of a string of cover-ups, was heavily criticsed by local media today for waiting hours before disclosing details of the power cut. Its spokeman Mr Ono acknowledged that the plant was vulnerable, saying: 'Fukushima Dai-ichi still runs on makeshift equipment and we are trying to switch to something more permanent and dependable, which is more desirable. The March 2011 tsunami crippled the Fukushima plant when waves destroyed cooling facilities and reactors overheated. 'Considering the equipment situation, we may be pushing a little too hard.' Mr Ono said the utility did not immediately try to switch to a back-up cooling system because doing so without finding and fixing the cause could lead to a repeat of the problem. There is a backup cooling system but no backup outside power, he said. Regulators have previously raised concerns about the makeshift equipment, and have urged the plant to switch them to a more permanent arrangement. The operator still has to remove melted, fatally radioactive fuel from the reactors before fully decommissioning the plant, which officials say could take 40 years. The tsunami on 11 March 2011 saw huge waves knock out the cooling facilities at the nuclear power plant. As a result the reactors overheated and went into meltdown. The plant has since been stabilised but the full effect of the disaster is yet to be ascertained. Yoshihide Suga, the chief government spokesman, sought to allay concerns today, saying: 'In a sense, we have put in place measures that leave no room for worry.'","completion":"In March 2013, there was a power cut at Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. The power cut caused three fuel storage pools to be without fresh cooling water for almost a day. This raised concerns about the safety and stability of the damaged nuclear plant. The company running the plant, TEPCO, said the temperatures in the pools were safe and would stay that way for a few days, but they were working on a backup system just in case. The 2011 tsunami had badly damaged the plant, causing some reactors to overheat and fuel storage pools to get too hot. The plant has been using temporary equipment since then and it still needs a lot of work to become completely safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ebenezer is one of the nicest men there ever was, generous and giving to a fault (so generous that the majority of his profits are given away to charities).On Christmas Eve, Ebenezer is visited by the Spirit of Christmas (Robbie Coltrane), who just happens to have accidentally stopped by Blackadder's place by mistake. Even so, Ebenezer offers him some respite from his busy evening of helping miser's to change their ways. The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly. Curious, Ebenezer asks to know more, and the Spirit goes into several flashbacks.The first vision shows how Lord Blackadder managed to con his way into great fortune and entitlement by tricking Queen Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) into executing Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry).The second vision shows Edmund Blackadder tricking Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) into giving up his valuable worldly goods to the poor.These visions intrigue Ebenezer, and he also wishes to see the future. However, the Spirit shows him two futures: if he becomes bad, his future descendant will become ruler of the Universe. If he stays good, he'll become the slave to the future descendant of Mr Baldrick.The Spirit of Christmas then attempts to leave, hoping that none of what Ebenezer has seen will cause him to stray from the side of good. Ebenezer claims he won't, and the Spirit departs.The next day however, it becomes apparent that Ebenezer has lied.

It contains approximately 85 species in two genera, \\"Alangium\\" and \\"Cornus\\". They are mostly trees and shrubs, which may be deciduous or evergreen, although a few species are perennial herbs. Members of the family usually have opposite or alternate simple leaves, four- or five-parted flowers clustered in inflorescences or pseudanthia, and drupaceous fruits. In northern temperate areas, Cornaceae are well known from the dogwoods \\"Cornus\\". - An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches. Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes. Inflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern. - Alangium is a small genus of flowering plants. The genus is included either in a broad view of the dogwood family Cornaceae, or as the sole member of its own family Alangiaceae. \\"Alangium\\" has about 40 species, but some of the species boundaries are not entirely clear. The type species for \\"Alangium\\" is \\"Alangium decapetalum\\", which is now treated as a subspecies of \\"Alangium salviifolium\\". All of the species are shrubs or small trees, except the liana \\"Alangium kwangsiense\\". \\"A. chinense, A. platanifolium\\", and \\"A. salviifolium\\" are known in cultivation. - Cornus is a genus of about 3060 species of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, commonly known as dogwoods, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, and distinctive bark. Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and a few of the woody species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China and Japan and the southeastern United States particularly rich in native species. - Mastixia glauca is a tree in the family Cornaceae . The specific epithet glauca is from the Greek meaning \`\` bluish - grey '' , referring to the colour of the leaf underside . - The Cornales are an order of flowering plants, basal among the asterids, containing about 600 species.

When a few parents asked the principal to move their children into the writer's class, it further fueled the tensions between the writer and his fellow teachers. These teachers, who were already unhappy with the writer's seemingly unconventional approach to teaching, felt threatened by his growing popularity among students and parents. Consequently, they became defensive and were ready to attack him, either verbally or by undermining his methods and decisions. These colleagues likely felt that the writer's success and the parents' requests were somehow detrimental to their own professional standing. They might have believed that if more students were moved into the writer's class, it would imply that their teaching methods were not as effective or preferred by the students and their parents. Instead of celebrating a fellow teacher's success and embracing the opportunity to learn from one another, these teachers chose to view the situation competitively. This behavior not only created a toxic work environment for the writer in his first year of teaching but also detracted from the shared goal of providing the best possible education for the students. Despite the challenges presented by his colleagues, the writer continued to focus on his students by spending time with them, building relationships, and encouraging their learning. By following his wife's advice and adhering to the Golden Rule, the writer demonstrated resilience and commitment to his profession and his students. This experience highlights a crucial lesson that it is important to prioritize students' needs, understand different teaching styles of educators, and promote collaboration among teachers to create a productive and supportive educational environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 9-4 shot, ridden by Ryan Moore, fought past runner-up Decorated Knight, with Ulysses in third. Highland Reel prevailed by one and a quarter lengths for the sixth Group One victory of his career and the 300th top-level triumph for his trainer. Coming 19 days after his Coronation Cup win at Epsom, it was O'Brien's first success of the 2017 Royal meeting. There were two French victories earlier in the day with Qemah winning the Duke of Cambridge Stakes after Le Brivido took the Jersey Stakes. Highland Reel showed his toughness once again as he secured a victory which took his career prize money to just short of the £6m mark. The five-year-old sat on the heels of early leader Scottish but was briefly passed by Ulysses and Decorated Knight before battling back. \\"He's an incredible horse. He has pace, courage, tactical speed,\\" said O'Brien. Highland Reel won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot last year and later in 2016 landed the Breeders' Cup Turf in the United States. Moore said: \\"This lad has been everywhere but he keeps coming back. He's so tough, he's got a marvellous attitude.\\" Jack Hobbs, the 2-1 favourite, looked to be in contention but faded to finish last. BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght: I won't be the only person kicking myself for not having a few quid on Highland Reel. Not only were there doubts over the good to firm going and the mile and a quarter distance for Jack Hobbs, but Highland Reel is almost always simply magnificent. Whatever the continent (he's won in the US and Hong Kong too) and whatever the drama (he arrived at Epsom with just minutes to spare before taking the Coronation Cup), this horse can be relied upon practically always to perform. That's nearly £6m in prize money, thus making him Aidan O'Brien's biggest earner. The Queen travelled from the State Opening of Parliament to Ascot and witnessed an afternoon sprinkled with international victories. Qemah ran out a second French winner of the day when landing the Duke of Cambridge Stakes following the earlier success of Le Brivido. The 5-2 favourite, ridden by Gregory Benoist for Jean-Claude Rouget, held off the fast-finishing outsider Aljazzi by three quarters of a length. It was a second Royal Ascot win for the four-year-old Qemah, owned by Al Shaqab Racing, after victory in the Coronation Stakes last year. Compatriot Usherette, successful in 2016, struggled for room before closing to finish another neck away. Le Brivido was well backed for the Jersey Stakes and justified the confidence. The 2-1 favourite, trained by Andre Fabre, held on under Pierre-Charles Boudot to deny O'Brien's 66-1 outsider Spirit Of Valor. Happy Like A Fool, the odds-on favourite trained in the United States by Wesley Ward, had to settle for second as Heartache (5-1) won the Queen Mary Stakes. Winning trainer Clive Cox once again showed his aptitude for handling sprinters, with jockey Adam Kirby making use of his mount's high draw. \\"She's got a big future, she's very special,\\" said Cox. There were jubilant scenes in the winner's enclosure for owners the Hot To Trot Syndicate, which boasts 75 members. Jockey Martin Dwyer guided Zhui Feng to a front-running victory in the Royal Hunt Cup. The four-year-old colt gave trainer Amanda Perrett her first Royal Ascot victory for 17 years. American trainer Ward, successful with Lad Aurelia on Tuesday, celebrated a second win of the 2017 Royal Ascot meeting as Con Te Partiro caused an upset in the Sandringham Handicap. The 20-1 chance, given a typically patient ride by Irish jockey Jamie Spencer, came home ahead of the Ryan Moore-ridden Rain Goddess. Josephine Gordon was 15th on favourite Gymnaste having earlier finished fifth in the Jersey Stakes aboard Dream Castle. She was bidding to become only the second female jockey to ride a winner at Royal Ascot - 30 years on from Gay Kelleway. Thursday is Ladies' Day at Royal Ascot with a crowd of about 65,000 expected at the Berkshire course. The Gold Cup (16:20 BST) is the feature race where last year's winner Order Of St George will bid to follow up for trainer Aidan O'Brien. O'Brien is seeking his eighth win in 12 years in the two-and-a-half mile contest. Opposition includes dual Goodwood Cup winner Big Orange, trained by Michael Bell, and Ralph Beckett's 2015 St Leger winner Simple Verse.

Question: Dr. Jones studied 2 groups of people to see the effects of aging on humans. Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases? Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, group A, consisting of people under 35 years old, would have a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases compared to group B, which consists of people over 65 years old.

What is the answer?","completion":"A marathon is a long-distance running event with a specific distance of 26.2 miles or 42.195 kilometers. The marathon has its origins in ancient Greece and is now a prominent sporting event held across the globe. The race gets its name from the Battle of Marathon, fought between the Greeks and Persians in 490 BC. According to legend, a Greek messenger named Pheidippides ran from the battle site to Athens to deliver the victory news, covering a distance similar to a modern-day marathon. Although marathons are now measured in both metric and imperial units, the 26.2-mile distance remains the most widely used. The choice for this specific measurement was introduced in the 1908 London Olympic Games when the race was extended to 26 miles and 385 yards (or 26.2 miles) to enable the course to start at Windsor Castle and finish in front of the royal box at the Olympic Stadium. Since then, the 26.2 miles distance has become the standardized length for marathon races worldwide. Marathons can vary slightly in distance, as race organizers may make small adjustments when designing the course, but these deviations are generally minimal and approved by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Competitors who are aiming to complete a marathon must undergo rigorous training, usually for several months or even years, to build their stamina, technique, and mental fortitude. The race itself can be an incredible physical and mental challenge, with runners relying on their developed endurance to finish the 26.2-mile-long course. In summary, a marathon running event spans 26.2 whole miles or 42.195 kilometers. This distance has fascinating roots in ancient Greek history and is now a standard international measurement for marathons, inspiring athletes worldwide to push their limits and compete in these challenging but rewarding races."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: To form your ingredients for bread into a dough?","completion":"The best way to form your ingredients for bread into a dough involves the following step-by-step process: 1. Gather your ingredients: Ensure you have all the necessary ingredients for bread dough - flour, water, yeast, sugar/honey, salt, and oil/butter (optional). Measuring each ingredient precisely is crucial to the success of your bread dough. 2. Activate the yeast: If you're using active dry yeast, it needs to be activated first. In a small bowl, mix the yeast with slightly warm water and sugar/honey. Allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This step isn't necessary for instant yeast, which can be mixed directly with the other ingredients. 3. Combine dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Mix well to distribute the salt evenly. 4. Add wet ingredients: Pour the activated yeast mixture (or instant yeast) into the large bowl with the flour mix. Also add any additional wet ingredients such as oil or melted butter. Begin mixing with a wooden spoon or your hands to incorporate the wet ingredients into the dry ones. 5. Mix and knead: Once the dough starts to form, use your hands to knead the dough. The goal is to achieve a smooth and elastic consistency. Kneading might take around 10-15 minutes. If the dough feels too sticky, you can add more flour, but take care not to make it too dry. If it's too dry, add small amounts of water. 6. First rise: Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl, ensuring the entire surface is coated with the oil. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size. 7. Punch down and shape: After the dough has risen, gently punch it down to deflate the large air bubbles. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface, and shape it according to the type of bread you're making. 8. Second rise (optional): Some bread recipes call for a second rise, particularly for enriched bread or those with a tighter crumb structure. In this case, after shaping the dough, place it in a greased loaf pan or on a baking sheet, cover it, and let it rise for an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour. 9. Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe (usually between 350-450°F or 175-230°C) while following the second rise or immediately after shaping your dough. 10. Bake: Once risen and the oven is preheated, place the dough in the oven and bake for the specified time in the recipe. Baking times can vary depending on the type and size of the bread. Following these steps ensures that your bread dough is properly formed and has the best possible texture and flavor. Adjust your recipe based on your type of yeast and bread, and always remember that practice makes perfect!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This phrase likely refers to a specific committee responsible for the selection and recruitment of staff for a country's national penitentiary system. The main function of such committees is to ensure that the personnel working in prisons and correctional facilities meet the standards and qualifications required to effectively manage and rehabilitate inmates, while maintaining a safe and secure environment for both the inmates and the staff. These committees may consist of various stakeholders, including representatives from the prison service, the ministry of justice, and human resources experts, among others. Their role is essential in the hiring process, as they have the important task of evaluating potential candidates and selecting individuals who will play a role in shaping the prison system. The process of staff selection and recruitment in the national penitentiary system typically involves several steps: 1. Job posting and advertisement: The committee first identifies the open positions within the prison system and advertises them through relevant channels, such as newspapers, job boards, and government websites, to reach a wide audience of qualified applicants. 2. Application review: After the application deadline, the committee reviews all submitted applications, assessing each candidate's qualifications, experience, and suitability for the specific position. 3. Initial screening and shortlisting: The committee then conducts an initial screening, during which they evaluate each applicant's resume, cover letter, and any other relevant documents. They may also conduct preliminary phone or video interviews to further narrow down the pool of candidates. 4. In-person interviews and assessments: Once the shortlist has been established, the committee invites candidates for in-person interviews. The interviews often involve structured questions, as well as various assessments, such as psychological tests, skills tests, or roleplays to evaluate each individual's aptitude for the position. 5. Background checks and reference verification: After the interviews, the committee performs background checks on the final candidates, verifying their references, criminal history, and any other relevant information that could impact their fitness for the job. 6. Final selection and job offer: The committee evaluates all the information gathered throughout the process and makes a final decision on the candidate(s) to be offered the job. Once selected, HR personnel extend a formal job offer, which includes the terms and conditions of employment. 7. Training and onboarding: Once the candidate accepts the job offer, they undergo an orientation and training program to familiarize themselves with the prison system and its policies and procedures. This may include general training for all staff, as well as specialized training for specific positions. The \\"74 21\\" included in the phrase may correspond to a reference number or code associated with the particular committee or a specific recruitment campaign. This information may be useful for tracking purposes or for candidates who want to inquire about the status of their application."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As a result, at the end of the war there were many orphans there. A man called Hermann Gmeiner wanted to help these children. His idea was simple. He wanted orphans to have a home, and he wanted them to have the care and kindness of parents. Gmeiner asked people to give him some money. With this money he built the first SOS Children's Village at Imst, in Austria. It opened in1949. This is how the SOS stand for \\"Save Our Souls .\\" This means \\"Please help us!\\" An SOS Children' village gives help to orphans. Hermann Gmeiner's idea for helping orphans soon spread all over the world. By 1983 there were 170 SOS Children's Villages in the world. People in many countries give money to help the villages. Today the children from the first village have grown up. Now some of them work in other SOS Children's Villages. In SOS Villages orphans live in family groups. There are several houses in each village. The biggest village has 40 or 50 houses! Between seven and ten children live in a house. A woman lives with each group of children and looks after them. She gives the children a lot of love and kindness. She cooks meals for them and makes comfortable, happy home for them. Of course, the children don't spend all their time in the village. They go to school, they go out with their friends. But the village gives them a home--sometimes for the first time in their lives. Question: Which of the following came last?

Firstly, the talk brought me different kinds of information. I also got to hear all the family secrets of the newcomers. I have a toy bear who was a great comforter for the little ones. The kids got to look after him on the trip to school and he waited patiently for _ to get on for the trip home. Our bus would often pass a place where we could see some alpacas in front of a farm house. Little Michael would cry excitedly from the seat, \\"Look, Miss! Look at the camels!\\" He used to put his head out of the bus window. When I warned him that a little insect would come into his nose if he wasn't careful, he smartly gave up the habit. I remember a little girl got on the bus one morning 5 years ago and sobbed all the way to school. We arrived at the school gate. As she waited to get down the bus, she threw her arms around my neck and cried that her grandfather had died the night before. A school bus driver needs to keep one eye on the road and the other on the mirror to watch what the little ones are doing down the back.

Based on the premise \\"they've had their house that long\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"They like living in the house and plan to stay indefinitely.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"they've had their house that long,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"They like living in the house and plan to stay indefinitely\\" is true. While the premise suggests stability and potentially a sense of satisfaction with the house, there are several other factors to consider before drawing any conclusions about their true feelings towards the house and their future plans. Some of these factors include: 1. Financial considerations: One possible reason why they've had the house for so long could be due to financial constraints that make moving to a new house challenging. For example, they could be facing a difficult housing market, or they might not have enough savings to afford a new home. 2. Attachment to the community: Another reason they could be staying in the same house for this long could be that they have a deep attachment to their neighborhood, friends, and community. Their preference for living in the house might have more to do with the surrounding environment and social connections than the house itself. 3. Personal circumstances: It is possible that some personal factors or family circumstances are influencing their decision to stay in the house for such an extended period. For example, if they have children that are attending nearby schools or elderly family members who need support, those factors could be playing a significant role in their ongoing decision to stay in the house. 4. Difficulty in finding a suitable alternative: They might have been actively considering moving to another house, but they could be facing challenges in finding a suitable alternative that meets their needs and requirements. Until they find the perfect home that they desire, they might choose to stay in their current house. 5. Habit and comfort: Sometimes, people develop a comfort zone and prefer to maintain a stable routine. They might stay in their house for a prolonged period simply out of habit and comfort, even though they may not necessarily be entirely happy or satisfied with the actual house itself. Therefore, while the premise that they've had their house for a long time indicates a sense of stability, it does not provide enough information to definitively support the hypothesis that they like living in the house and plan to stay indefinitely. We would need further information about their emotions, satisfaction level, and future plans before drawing any conclusions about their intentions regarding the house."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sega's financial troubles led to several major structural changes at the company in the early 2000s, with development division United Game Artists being absorbed by Sonic Team in 2003, and Sonic Team USA eventually becoming Sega Studios USA in 2004. - Sonic Crackers , also sometimes referred to as Sonic Stadium ( due to the ROM header containing the title Sonic Studium ( sic ) ) , is an early Sonic the Hedgehog prototype video game for the Sega Genesis . While it was never officially released in the form of a Sonic the Hedgehog game , the concepts , engine , and various other materials in the prototype were subsequently implemented in the Sega 32X game Knuckles ' Chaotix in 1995 , and the prototype itself is widely circulated on the internet . - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega.

The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

It is a spin-off to the \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series, and the only one to be released for the system. It is also one of a few that does not feature Sonic himself. Instead, the game centers around Knuckles the Echidna, and the Chaotix team of characters as they try to stop Dr. Robotnik and Metal Sonic from their evil plans. Gameplay is similar to earlier \\"Sonic\\" titles, however, the game introduces a partner system in which the player's character is connected to another via a ring force bond with \\"rubber band\\" physics.

Today, Starbucks operates in over 80 countries, and it is the world's largest coffeehouse chain. Some of the largest international markets include the United States, China, Canada, Japan, and South Korea.

Moreover, the company's decision to grow via company-operated stores, licensed stores, and various franchises has also contributed to its extensive worldwide presence.

Write an article based on this \\"Don't try to mask or dilute the sample. Drink a lot of water starting the day before the test. Urinate as much as possible before the test. Consider substituting synthetic or clean urine for your own.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Tips for Ensuring a Clean Urine Sample: The Importance of Hydration and Safe Alternatives Introduction Whether you are preparing for a drug test or simply seeking ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle, producing a clean urine sample is critical for a variety of reasons. The process can be overwhelming, especially when you're uncertain about potential results and methods of achieving a clean sample. Rather than attempting to rely on risky techniques, such as masking or diluting the sample, it's important to take safer, more effective measures. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of drinking plenty of water, urinating frequently, and potentially considering the use of synthetic or clean urine for your test. Stay Hydrated One of the most crucial aspects of producing a clean urine sample is staying well-hydrated. Start by consuming an ample amount of water the day before the test, and continue drinking throughout the day of the test itself. Adequate hydration can enable your body to better flush out toxins, improving the likelihood of obtaining a clean sample. Remember that drinking too much water in a short amount of time can lead to a condition known as water intoxication, or hyponatremia, which can be dangerous. It is essential to pace yourself while hydrating to avoid any adverse effects. Urinate Frequently In addition to keeping your body properly hydrated, make sure to urinate as much as possible before the test. This helps to eliminate waste and toxins from your body, further increasing the possibility of providing a clean urine sample. Drinking plenty of fluids will naturally encourage frequent urination. Avoid Masking or Diluting the Sample The use of masking agents or diluting your urine may seem like a quick fix, but these methods carry significant risks, as they can result in inconclusive or inaccurate test results. Additionally, many testing facilities have become adept at identifying adulterated samples, which may lead to consequences such as job loss or disciplinary action. Consider Substituting Synthetic or Clean Urine If you're still concerned about providing a clean urine sample, one option you can consider is substituting synthetic or clean urine for your own. Synthetic urine is laboratory-made and contains the same chemical composition as natural urine, making it a reliable alternative for testing purposes. Clean urine refers to a sample from another individual with a known history of being drug-free. It is important to note that substituting urine samples may be against the rules of certain institutions or may have legal implications. Always review the specific guidelines and policies of the testing facility before deciding to use a substitute urine sample. Conclusion Obtaining a clean urine sample is essential for both personal health and adherence to various testing regulations and policies. By staying well-hydrated, urinating frequently, and avoiding risky techniques like masking or diluting the sample, you can increase the likelihood of providing a clean and accurate urine sample. If necessary, and within the bounds of the relevant guidelines, consider using synthetic or clean urine as a safe alternative. Ultimately, understanding and implementing safe strategies for ensuring a clean urine sample will contribute to a healthier lifestyle and peace of mind during testing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Motorhead () were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member, guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motorhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. Motorhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. In July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with Bronze Records. The resulting \\"Louie Louie\\" single was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a BBC Radio 1 John Peel in session on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 BBC Live & In-Session album), and appeared for the first time on BBC Television's Top of the Pops on 25 October. Chiswick capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album Motorhead on white vinyl through EMI Records. The single's success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer Jimmy Miller at Roundhouse Studios. A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played \\"Overkill\\" on Top of the Pops to support the release of the single ahead of the Overkill album, which was released on 24 March. It became Motorhead's first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. These releases were followed by the \\"Overkill\\" UK tour which began on 23 March. A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track \\"No Class\\" as the A-side with the previously unreleased song \\"Like a Nightmare\\" on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart. During July and August, except for a break to appear at the Reading Festival, the band were working on their next album, Bomber. Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 December, it was followed by the \\"Bomber\\" single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The \\"Bomber\\" Europe and UK tour followed, with support from Saxon. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft bomber-shaped lighting rig. During the \\"Bomber\\" tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975-1976 and released them as the album On Parole, which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December. On 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in Europe, Bronze released The Golden Years, which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The band had, however, preferred the title Flying Tonight, in reference to the \\"Bomber\\" lighting rig. On 20 August, the band (40 minutes) and Girlschool (20 minutes) were filmed performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the Rockstage programme, broadcast on UK television by the ATV station on 4 April 1981.

Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying \\"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\\" Jackson's airplay and music channel blacklist remained persistent, massively affecting her chart performance and exposure. However, lead single \\"Call on Me\\", which featured rapper Nelly, peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot 100, number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number six in the United Kingdom. The video for the album's second single, \\"So Excited\\", was directed by Joseph Kahn and portrayed Jackson's clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine. 20 Y.O. was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold 1.2 million worldwide, also receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. After the album's release, Dupri was condemned for his production and misguidance of the album, and subsequently was removed from his position at Virgin Records. Slant Magazine stated, \\"After promising a return to Janet's dance-pop origins, [Dupri] opted to aim for urban audiences, a colossal mistake that cost Dupri his job and, probably, Janet her deal with Virgin.\\" Jackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment industry by Forbes, having amassed a fortune of over 150 million. In 2007, she starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist in the film Why Did I Get Married?. It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office, grossing 60 million in total.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years?

It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include \\"Pharrell's 'Happy\\"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge\\" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents \\"without sounding overly patronizing\\". \\"Shine\\" ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.When discussing the development of the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics.

Your answer:","completion":"The planet with the longest planetary year among the options provided is [IV] Neptune. A planetary year is the time it takes for a planet to complete a full orbit around the Sun. This period varies depending on the distance of the planet from the Sun and the speed at which the planet orbits. Among the options given, let's compare the length of their planetary years: [I] Earth: Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the Sun, which is why we have a leap year every four years to account for the extra day that accumulates. The length of Earth's year is the base unit by which we measure time and is thus considered one Earth year. [II] Venus: Venus has a very unique orbital period. It takes approximately 224.7 Earth days to orbit the Sun. Interestingly, Venus rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction compared to most other planets. As a result, a day on Venus (from sunrise to sunrise) lasts longer than its year, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. [III] Jupiter: As the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter takes about 11.9 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. This is due to its greater distance from the Sun and its slower orbital speed. While Jupiter's year is lengthy compared to Earth's, it is not the longest among the given options. [IV] Neptune: Neptune is the farthest recognized planet in our solar system and takes the longest time in the provided options to complete an orbit around the Sun, thus having the longest planetary year. Due to its vast distance from the Sun, it takes approximately 164.8 Earth years to complete one full orbit. This means that since its discovery in 1846, Neptune has only completed a little more than one full orbit around the Sun. In conclusion, among the options provided, [IV] Neptune has the longest planetary year, taking 164.8 Earth years to complete a full orbit around the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Rifugio Elisabetta is located 3 km north-east of the Col de la Seigne, at the south-west end of a mountain range in the Alps. The Alps mountain range extends across several countries in Europe, such as France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia. However, based on the location described in the question, the Alps are mostly in France and Italy, but also straddling another country. That country is Switzerland. Let's analyze the information provided: Col de la Seigne is a mountain pass that forms the border between France and Italy. Therefore, the mountain range where Rifugio Elisabetta is located extends predominantly across France and Italy. Given its position to the south-west of the Alp range, the most likely country it straddles, besides France and Italy, is Switzerland, since Switzerland is located to the north and east of France in the Alps and borders both France and Italy.

For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.

Doctors say Mrs Gandhi is making \\"steady progress\\". In 2011 Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition. In 2014, she was admitted to a Delhi hospital for treatment of an infection. And in 2013, she was taken to a hospital for a few hours after she fell ill in parliament. On Tuesday, Mrs Gandhi suffered from viral fever and dehydration during a party campaign in Varanasi, the constituency of rival politician and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh state. She also reportedly had a fall. The surgery on Thursday lasted nearly two hours, but a statement from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency, said she was recovering well. Reports say she is likely to be discharged in a week. Mrs Gandhi, 69, is the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. She is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has governed India for most of the time since independence in 1947. Her party lost the 2014 general elections to Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).","completion":"Mrs. Gandhi, an important lady in India, got hurt in a city called Varanasi and had to go to a hospital in Delhi.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Moon craters may hold ancient asteroid pieces NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center / Arizona State University Sunrise shadows on the moon's Tycho crater, as seen by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on June 10, 2011. Twenty-five percent of the moon's impact craters may retain substantial remnants of the asteroids that created them, a new study finds. The surprising result suggests that scientists will have to work a little harder than they had perhaps anticipated to figure out what the moon is made of, researchers said. \\"Future studies of the moon's composition will have to show that exposed surface rocks really come from the moon and were not delivered by impacts, especially for unusual or exotic minerals,\\" said co-author Jay Melosh of Purdue University. [10 Surprising Moon Facts] Melosh and his colleagues, led by Zhong Yue of Purdue and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Remote Sensing Applications in Beijing, used computer models to simulate the formation of lunar craters by asteroid impacts. They determined thatone-quarter of space rock strikes on the moon likely occur at a velocity of 26,800 mph (43,130 km/h) or less — blazingly fast, to be sure, but not fast enough to obliterate the asteroid. Other simulations performed by the team show that, at such impact speeds, little asteroid material is vaporized and lots of it is hurled against the walls of the newly formed crater. If the crater is at least 12 miles (20 kilometers) or so wide, impactor remnants tend to accumulate in a central peak as the crater collapses under the moon's gravity. The findings of the new study, which was published online Friday in the journal Nature Geoscience, could explain the occurrence of minerals called spinels and olivines in the central peaks of large lunar craters such as the 58-mile-wide (93 km) Copernicus. Spinels and olivines are common in many asteroids, so it's possible that these and other minerals that scientists had assumed were indigenous to the moon were actually delivered via space rock strikes, researchers said. \\"We cannot infer the deep composition of the moon from rocks in the centers of large craters without more care than has been used to date,\\" Melosh told Space.com via email. The findings have other intriguing ramifications as well. Some material blasted off Earth by colossal impacts long ago, after all, is thought to have hit the moon at relatively slow velocities. \\"This raises the possibility of finding early Earth material, ejected by collisions billions of years ago, in massive deposits on the moon, and suggests yet another explanation for the spinels: that they are deposits derived from the Earth’s upper mantle, emplaced long ago on to the moon and reworked,\\" Erik Asphaug of Arizona State University writes in an accompanying commentary in the same issue of Nature Geoscience. \\"Even more provocative is the suggestion that we might someday find Earth’s protobiological materials, no longer available on our geologically active and repeatedly recycled planet, in dry storage up in the lunar 'attic,'\\" Asphaug adds.

There were 66 people on board when the Airbus A320 crashed on 19 May while flying from Paris to Cairo. It vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call. \\"The signal from a beacon from a flight recorder has been detected,\\" said Remi Jouty of France's Bureau of Investigations and Analysis. A priority search area has been established, he added. Laplace is using acoustic detection systems to listen to the locator \\"pings\\" given off by the black boxes underwater. A specialist vessel carrying robots able to dive to 3,000 metres (3,280 yards) is due to arrive next week. Egyptian investigators first reported that the French vessels had picked up signals from the wreckage search area, saying they were \\"assumed\\" to be from one of the devices. Officials from the country said last week signals from the plane's emergency beacon had been detected but later said they were received on the day of the crash and were not new. What caused the crash remains a mystery. Finding the black boxes is crucial to piecing together what happened in the plane's final moments. A militant attack has not been ruled out but no extremist group has claimed the downing of the plane. Human or technical error is also a possibility. Flight data revealed that smoke detectors went off in the toilet and the aircraft's electrics, minutes before the plane's signal was lost. Black boxes emit signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams an ever-narrowing window to locate them before their batteries run out. Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea, some 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria. But the bulk of the plane and the bodies of passengers are thought to be deep under the sea. Those on board MS804 included 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.","completion":"A French vessel has detected signals from one of the EgyptAir Flight MS804 black boxes, which could help establish the cause of the crash that occurred on May 19 in the Mediterranean Sea."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Pope has confirmed he will visit both New York and Washington DC as part of a trip to the U.S. later this year. The Vatican had previously announced that the Pontiff would visit Philadelphia to participate in a massive rally for Catholic families in September. But speaking to reporters on a plane returning to Rome at the end of a trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines yesterday, Francis said he would be visiting the two cities for the first time since becoming head of the Roman Catholic Church. Scroll down for video. Pope Francis addressing journalists on the papal plane on his way back to Rome after visiting Manila as part of a week long trip to Asia. Here he confirmed he would be visiting Washington and New York later this year. The itinerary for the trip is yet to be finalised but it is expected that he could visit the White House and address Congress as well as speak at the United Nations in New York. It is also believed he could give a mass in Madison Square Garden and visit Ground Zero. However, it has been confirmed that when in the U.S. capital he will take part in a ceremony to cannonise Junipero Serra, an 18th century Spanish Franciscan priest. There had been speculation that the Pope could have included a stop in California as part of his U.S. visit, especially as Serra founded missions in the state. But the 79-year-old said: 'I would like to go to California for the canonisation of Junipero, but I think there is the problem of time. It requires two more days.' He then said that the sainthood ceremony would take place at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception instead. Serra was born on the Spanish island of Majorca in 1713, went to the Americas in the middle of the 18th century and led one of the first Franciscan missions in California. He arrived in San Diego in 1769 and spent most of the rest of his life there before dying at a mission in Carmel near Monterey in 1784. Meanwhile the city of Philadelphia has already begun preparations for the Pontiff's visit in September, which will coincide at the end of the week long World Meeting of Families. There had been speculation that Pope Francis was set to visit California but he told journalists on the flight that there wouldn't be enough time. It is expected that 1.5 million people could turn out for an open air Mass on the steps of the city's main art museum and that the crowd could fill a one-and-a-half mile stretch of parkway along the Schuylkill River. Francis also disclosed proposed trips to Africa, in particular the Central African Republic and Uganda, which would most likely take place at the end of 2015 to avoid the rainy seasons. There are also plans to visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile, most likely in July. He also confirmed he hoped to visit Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in 2016 — and Peru at some point. The announcement of his travel plans comes after the pope addressed a record six million Catholics in Manila on Sunday as his Asian pilgrimage drew to a close. On the flight back to the Vatican, he also spoke of how Catholics 'shouldn't breed like rabbits' and should instead practice 'responsible parenting'. While firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception, Francis said there are plenty of church-approved ways to regulate births. But he said most importantly, no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size, blasting what he called the 'ideological colonization' of the developing world. Pope Francis, pictured yesterday as he departed Villamor Airbase in Manila, says Catholics do not have to breed 'like rabbits' African bishops, in particular, have long complained about how progressive Western ideas about birth control and gay rights are increasingly being imposed on the developing world by groups, institutions or individual nations, often as a condition for development aid. He said: 'Every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized.' The Pope's comments, taken together with his defence of the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception during the trip, could be a signal that a more conservative side to the pope is emerging.

Answer choices: - it keeps an organism warm - invertebrate - vertebrate chordate - gastropod shells - the body's largest organ - remains of prehistoric life - hard boned animals - roundworm A:","completion":"A vertebrate chordate is the kind of animal that is classified as having a vertebrae. Vertebrate chordates are members of the phylum Chordata and the subphylum Vertebrata. These animals possess a backbone or spinal column, which consists of individual vertebrae that house and protect the spinal cord. This characteristic distinguishes them from invertebrates, which lack a spinal column. Vertebrate chordates include a diverse group of animals such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. They exhibit a bilateral body plan, meaning they are symmetric along a central axis, with their bodies organized into a head, trunk, and tail. In addition to a vertebral column, vertebrate chordates also possess a number of other distinctive features, such as a well-developed central nervous system, paired sense organs, an internal skeleton made of bone or cartilage, and a closed circulatory system with a multi-chambered heart. Here is a brief overview of the answer choices provided and why they do not describe an animal with a vertebrae as accurately as a vertebrate chordate: - It keeps an organism warm: This is not a classification method but rather a function that some features, such as fur or blubber, serve in certain animals. - Invertebrate: These are animals without a backbone or spinal column and are, therefore, not classified as having vertebrae. - Gastropod shells: These structures are found in a class of mollusks, called gastropods, and are not related to the presence of vertebrae. - The body's largest organ: This refers to the human skin or the integumentary system in general, which is not a classification for animals with vertebrae. - Remains of prehistoric life: This phrase describes fossils, which can be of any ancient organism, not just those with vertebrae. - Hard boned animals: While this might describe some vertebrate chordates, it is not a specific enough classification because some vertebrates have cartilage-based skeletons instead of bone, such as cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays). - Roundworm: This is a type of invertebrate, specifically a member of the phylum Nematoda, and thus does not have a vertebrae. In conclusion, the most accurate classification for an animal with a vertebrae is a vertebrate chordate, as it specifically refers to organisms within the subphylum Vertebrata that possess a backbone or spinal column, distinguishing them from other animals."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

In the original sentence, \\"There is a man that wearing black and white sitting on a pole with their face painted white holding balls,\\" there are three main points of information: 1. The man is wearing black and white. 2. The man has his face painted white. 3. The man is holding balls (round objects). The given sentence captures two of the key details from the original sentence: that the man has his face painted and that he is holding round objects (which are referred to as \\"balls\\" in the original sentence). Although the given sentence omits some aspects - such as the man's attire, the pole he is sitting on, and the specific color of the face paint - it still encompasses crucial elements from the original statement. Therefore, the sentence \\"A man has his face painted and is holding round objects\\" is a true statement as the information provided in this statement accurately represents elements from the original sentence. However, it is important to note that the given sentence does not provide a complete summary, as it omits certain details about the man's clothing, the pole, and the colors.

Choose between \\"paper napkin\\" and \\"cloth napkin\\". Question: A pen writing on a paper napkin experiences more friction then one writing on a cloth napkin. This means the motion of the pen is quicker on the (A) paper napkin (B) cloth napkin Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the factors that contribute to pen motion and friction on both types of napkins. Step 1: Define the relationship between friction and pen motion. - When more friction is present, the pen's motion will generally be slower, as increased resistance from the surface makes it more difficult for the pen to glide smoothly. - When less friction is present, the pen's motion will typically be faster, as the surface offers less resistance and allows for a smoother glide. Step 2: Assess the given information in the question. - The question states that a pen experiences more friction when writing on a paper napkin than on a cloth napkin. Step 3: Apply the information from Step 2 to the relationship defined in Step 1. - Since there is more friction on a paper napkin, the pen's motion will be slower on the paper napkin. - Conversely, because there is less friction on the cloth napkin, the pen's motion will be quicker on the cloth napkin. Step 4: Choose the correct answer based on the information. Answer: The motion of the pen is quicker on the (B) cloth napkin."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.

S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects. And for the first time, several private groups are building spacecraft to land on the moon in an attempt to win millions of dollars in the Google Lunar X Prize. Some participants say that they plan to gain some property rights in the mission. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ . - it's a waste of time to work on the lunar project - \\" The Outer Space Treaty\\" forbids private groups to land on the moon - all mankind has the right to land on the moon - whenever you come to the moon, you'll get some property rights on it Answer:","completion":"all mankind has the right to land on the moon"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Under new rules set down by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden, camera drones qualify as surveillance cameras and require a licence. Permits can be expensive and paying to apply for one does not guarantee it will eventually be granted. There are no exceptions made for journalists, and critics have said the ruling could mean job losses. In what some are describing as a \\"huge blow\\" to the aerial photography and camera drone industry, the court ruled that drone-mounted cameras are \\"regarded as surveillance cameras\\". Industry group UAS Sweden (Unmanned Aerial System) has argued that the court ruling could put 5,000 jobs in danger. \\"It is a bad decision for Sweden as an entrepreneur country and ominous for the Swedish labour market that is constantly affected by new obscure and complicated regulations from the state and its agencies,\\" said Gustav Gerdes, president of UAS. A lower district court in Sweden had previously ruled that camera drones did not constitute camera surveillance but that decision has now been overruled. According to photography website PetaPixel, more than 20,000 drones were sold in Sweden in 2014 with more than 1,000 permits issued for using camera drones for commercial purposes. In the UK, people wishing to operate a drone must follow some basic safety rules such as keeping it within line of sight, no more than 400ft above and 500m ahead, according to the Civil Aviation Authority's drone code. They will need to obtain permission from the CAA if they are flying a device over a congested area or within 50m of a building. Drone operators must also \\"respect the privacy of people\\" around them and anyone with concerns about drones being used in their area are advised to contact the police.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Midnight Express was a professional wrestling tag team of changing members, mostly under the management of Jim Cornette. The group started in the early 1980s with Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose (and originally Norvell Austin). The late 1980s saw a new incarnation, consisting of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane, compete in JCP and WCW and shortly feuding with \\"The Original Midnight Express\\" of Condrey and Rose. In the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) combined Bob Holly and Bart Gunn as \\"The New Midnight Express\\". Due to various differences over the direction of the Midnight Express, Cornette, Lane and Eaton also left JCP for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner bought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation under the name World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When the issues were resolved, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the promotion. In the tournament to determine new World tag team champions, the Midnight Express advanced to the finals before losing to the Freebirds with some assistance from the Samoan Swat Team. They engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match. The Midnight Express soon turned heel as a result of a feud with the Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace & Shane Douglas). Jim Cornette duped the Dudes into thinking he wanted to be their manager but then turned on them during their match against the Midnight Express at Clash of the Champions IX in New York. The Dynamic Dudes gained a measure of revenge when the Midnight Express laid out an open challenge for any team for 10,000. After dispatching of a couple of no-name teams, the Express was challenged by the masked Dynamic Duo, billed from Gotham City, who pinned the Express and unmasked as Ace and Douglas. The feud soon lost steam and was forgotten soon after. After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a feud with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team titles. The Express won the titles from the young team in early 1990, but lost them to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) three months later. After a loss at Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express split up when Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation. For the first time in almost a decade there was no Midnight Express.

Concepts: day, pool, relax Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"A day at the pool is often viewed as one of the best ways to relax, especially under the summer sun; it's a time where both adults and children can free themselves from their daily routines and immerse themselves in a state of leisure and tranquility. A closer look at these concepts: day, pool, and relax, and their connection to each other gives a sense of an enjoyable activity that is both physically refreshing and spiritually calming. Starting with the concept of a day - a 24-hour period in our lives, it is a fundamental unit of time. Essentially, it's the way we organize our lives, it's divided into work hours, sleep hours, and time for all other activities. We all have good days and bad days, and often, what differentiates them is how we spend our hours. A day represents the opportunity to do something valuable or enjoyable. Turning to a pool, it's not just a repository of water, but also a significant symbol of recreation and relaxation in many cultures around the world. Pools invite us to swim, to exercise, and to have fun. They are places where you can either engage in high-energy splashing and games, or take it easy on a floating device. Pools are centres of social gatherings, a place where we can meet and engage with others. For kids, a pool is a vast sea of adventure, and for adults, it's about finding a temporary escape from the world outside that pool fence. The last concept, relaxation, is a state we all seek. In our fast-paced, high-stress modern society, relaxation is more than luxurious, it's necessary for maintaining mental and physical health. Relaxation refers to the state of being free from tension and anxiety, a state of calmness and peace. When we relax, we allow our bodies and minds to rest, recharge and renew. Putting these three concepts together - a day, a pool, and relaxation, we create a perfect trifecta of recreational activity. What can surpass the joy of spending a day by the pool, where you can forget about your emails and deadlines, soak in the water, enjoy the sun and simply be? This scenario creates a perfect reprieve from the chaos of regular life, where the biggest decision you'll need to make is whether to stay in the water or lounge on a pool chair with a cold drink in hand. Humans are blessed with the ability to comprehend the need for leisure and the ability to appreciate such tranquil moments. A day at the pool provides not only a way to cool down on a hot day, but also an opportunity to bond with family and friends, to enjoy a casual BBQ and just chill. It's a place where laughter fills the air, where you can play, share stories, or catch up on that book you've been meaning to read, all while being in the perfect state of relaxation. In essence, the sentence \\"A day at the pool is the best way to relax\\" signifies not just an activity, but a lifestyle and a state of mind; it's about taking time for yourself, enjoying the simple pleasures of life and handling the balance between work and leisure. This sentence reminds us that sometimes, the most beneficial thing we can do is to do nothing at all, and just relax by the pool."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Clyde Jackson Browne (born October 9, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who has sold over 18 million albums in the United States.

Gillian Triggs told Australia's ABC the versions of events given by different parties \\"simply don't add up\\". The Somali migrant at Australia's detention camp in Nauru says she became pregnant as a result of being raped. Australia says she changed her mind when she was allowed into the country last week, but she denies this. The 23-year-old woman - identified by her pseudonym Abyan - was sent back to the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday. Under Australia's asylum policy, any undocumented migrants trying to reach the country by boat are intercepted and held in centres on Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. In an interview to ABC TV's Lateline programme, Ms Triggs said: \\"It's extraordinary that she was expected to reach a decision in such a short space of time and when the answer wasn't given immediately she's literally air lifted back to Nauru.\\" Ms Triggs described the migrant as \\"obviously very distressed\\" and the one who \\"really needs counselling and a safe environment\\". She added that the versions of events given by Abyan's statement and comments by Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton \\"simply don't add up\\". The migrant was flown to Sydney after requesting an abortion, which is not legal in Nauru in most circumstances. But on Friday night, she was unexpectedly returned to Nauru, alarming her lawyers and rights groups. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Saturday that after seeing doctors, she had \\"decided not to proceed with the termination\\". But in a handwritten note released to the Australian media on Monday, Abyan denied this. \\"I have been very sick. I have never said that I did not want a termination. I never saw a doctor. I saw a nurse at the clinic but there was no counselling,\\" the note read. Abyan said she never saw a doctor, or had any counselling, and and that she was seen by a nurse with no translator present. \\"Please help me,\\" the statement said. Her lawyer, George Newhouse, has said she wanted more time to make the decision, and has accused the government of deporting her before he could seek an injunction blocking it. Is Australia's Cambodia solution 'an expensive joke'? Australia's controversial asylum policy On Monday, Mr Dutton insisted on ABC Radio that the woman had been seen several times by medical and counselling staff, with interpreters on most occasions, and had reached her own decision. He said he would not allow for women in such a situation to be treated as \\"political pawns\\" by opponents of Australia's immigration policy, saying some of the allegations being made were \\"patently incorrect, if not fabricated\\". \\"I'm very, very concerned about the privacy of this lady, but I'm dragged into this debate to clear up what I think is a political motivation by some of the advocates.\\" Last week, Mr Dutton said that refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru were asking for medical care in Australia in order to try to have their refugee claims processed on the mainland. He described the behaviour as a \\"racket\\". The Australian government says its asylum policy deters people traffickers but there has been been criticism of the conditions at the camps. In September, a report by a senate committee found conditions on Nauru were not \\"appropriate or safe\\". It said allegations of rape and abuse should be investigated.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The government is under immense pressure. Its underpaid and overstretched forces have been on the back foot in their first season without Nato combat support. They are trying to push the Taliban back, most recently in the key southern province of Helmand - but the way the insurgents took the northern city of Kunduz still weighs on people's minds. Afghans are watching all this with great concern. It is no surprise that - after Syria - the highest number of migrants in Europe come from Afghanistan. People here wonder which is the greater gamble - continuing to live in Afghanistan or risking death on the journey out. In the current climate one group is doing good business: people smugglers. The BBC gained rare access to one - we will call him Abdul (not his real name). Abdul said a trip out of Afghanistan into Iran, Turkey and ultimately Europe costs between 5,000 and 7,000 (Â£3,250 to Â£4,550). Abdul gets 10%, the rest goes to other smugglers in the network and pays for transportation. Migrants pay a deposit and their families pay the balance when they reach their destination. The journey is fraught with danger, something Abdul said he did not hide. \\"The most dangerous part is between Turkey and Greece. People get shot by police and sometimes the boats capsize. But Allah guarantees safety, not me,\\" he said. People from all walks of life and various parts of the country seek him out, he said, but he will not take them if they are unhealthy, too old, with small children or pregnant. Abdul seems conflicted about what he does - he feels he is helping people, but also acknowledges he is taking their money and sending them to an uncertain fate. \\"I smuggled my own three sons. I miss them a lot and I get upset when I see parents crying. I don't like my job very much you know. I feel guilty sometimes,\\" he said. Standing outside the passport office on a chilly Kabul morning, it is easy to see why people like Abdul are in business. Queues have already started forming. People crouch on car bonnets filling in forms. Everyone wants to leave - and most don't want to come back. Arif Mohamady, in his late 20s, is angry and frustrated. \\"There are no jobs here, no security and lots of corruption. I'd rather live in an infidel country,\\" he said. \\"In 2007 my father was killed in a suicide bombing. My mother and brother were killed by the Taliban. I know it's a dangerous journey but I'd rather die on the way than stay in Afghanistan.\\" Despite the overwhelming sense of despair, some take a more hopeful view. A group of young people have started a digital campaign called \\"Afghanistan Needs You\\". Shakib Mohsanyar, 23, said they wanted to stop the brain drain, while Sharam Gulzad, 26, said many Afghans had unrealistic expectations about life abroad. \\"I was in Germany and I saw Afghans begging for the first time there. It was heartbreaking. People think once they arrive things will get better. They won't,\\" he said. Both acknowledged that the problems of corruption, lack of jobs and insecurity are all too real. \\"When you go out in the morning you don't know if you're coming back home in the evening,\\" said Mr Gulzad. \\"But this is the risk we take. We do have potential. This is not the end of Afghanistan. If we take responsibility and action we will change this country.\\" This article was about:","completion":"The article discusses the precarious situation in Afghanistan, a country plagued by a multitude of problems, including overstretched and underpaid governmental forces, the resurgence of the Taliban, and a staggering number of migrants fleeing the nation for a chance at a better life in Europe. The Taliban have been gaining ground in Afghanistan, causing alarm and concern amongst the populace. The uncertainty and fear have led many Afghans to consider leaving their homeland and undertaking a treacherous journey in search of safety and opportunity in Europe. Afghanistan is currently the second largest source of migrants in Europe, after Syria. People smugglers are profiting from the desperation of the Afghan people, offering to transport them to European countries for a high price. One smuggler, \\"Abdul,\\" disclosed that a journey out of Afghanistan and into Europe would cost between 5,000 and 7,000, with a 10% cut going to the smuggler. The journey is incredibly dangerous, with the most perilous leg occurring between Turkey and Greece—a fact that \\"Abdul\\" admits to his clients. Afghans from various backgrounds and regions seek out people smugglers, putting their lives in the hands of these profiteers who claim to help them while exploiting their desperation and fear. The smugglers often face inner conflicts as they send people on such uncertain and perilous journeys. The atmosphere in Afghanistan is filled with anger, frustration, and a desire to leave. However, some young Afghans cling to hope and have started a digital campaign called \\"Afghanistan Needs You\\" in an effort to prevent a brain drain and encourage their fellow citizens to stay and help bring change to their troubled country. They acknowledge the corruption, lack of jobs, and insecurity that plagues Afghanistan, but hold on to the belief that with collective responsibility and action, they can make a difference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Can there be a bigger swing from the ultimate high to the lowest of lows than the one the Angels' Kendry Morales experienced on Saturday? In the celebration following his game-winning grand slam against Seattle, Morales suffered a broken lower leg when he jumped and landed awkwardly on home plate. Morales is scheduled to undergo surgery on Sunday and his recovery will most likely be measured in months, not weeks, according to the Orange County Register. Morales had appeared in every Angels game and was hitting .286 with 11 homers and 39 RBI. There's a chance those could be his totals for the entire season. Fantasy owners will need to make immediate plans to fill the void he leaves behind. Besides Morales, only backup catcher Bobby Wilson has even played a single inning at first all season, so there is no ready-made solution. Starting second baseman Howie Kendrick has played first before, but not since he appeared in 42 games there in 2006. The most likely replacement will come from the Angels' Class AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees. They have major league veteran Robb Quinlan, who's hitting .253 in 23 games and 24-year-old Mark Trumbo, who's hitting .275 with 11 homers and 39 RBI. No matter what the Angels do, the loss of Morales -- however long it is -- is a major blow to their playoff hopes. Fantasy owners feel their pain.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

Article: Since the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African–Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as mulatto and octoroon. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with \\"one drop\\" of known \\"Black blood\\" to be Black, regardless of appearance.3 By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states.4 Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of \\"Indian blood\\" (called blood quantum). To be White one had to have perceived \\"pure\\" White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black. The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

Sometimes, their teams didn't agree on things, but that didn't stop Jeff and Martin from being friends. One day, they decided to go on a big adventure together. They went to a faraway place called the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands are a group of islands in the middle of the big, blue ocean. But, instead of going to an island with lots of people, they went to a deserted island. That means there was nobody else on the island – no people, no houses, and no stores! Jeff and Martin had to live on the island for a whole week! Now, you might be wondering, how did they survive with no food or water? Well, Jeff and Martin are very smart and clever. They knew how to find food and water all by themselves. They caught fish from the ocean and found fruit on the trees. They even built a shelter to sleep in at night! While they were on this adventure, a group of people came with big video cameras. These people were from the Discovery channel, which is a channel on TV that shows interesting and exciting things.

Information: - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - New Ireland Province, formerly New Mecklenburg, is the most northeastern province of Papua New Guinea. - Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Lihir Island (a.k.a. Niolam Island) is the largest island in the Lihir group of islands, 22 km long and 14.5 km wide, in Papua New Guinea's New Ireland Province. It consists of a complex of several overlapping basaltic stratovolcanoes rising 700 m above sea level. While the volcanoes are not currently active, geothermal activity is still present. The island is in what was the forearc basin associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Bismarck Plate. Subduction stopped about 10 million years ago with the collision of the Ontong Java plateau with the subduction zone. - Subduction is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the mantle. Regions where this process occurs are known as \\"subduction zones\\". Rates of subduction are typically in centimeters per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately two to eight centimeters per year along most plate boundaries. - Lihir Island Airport is an airport in Londolovit on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea . The airport has a short unpaved runway long enough to handle a small jet . All flights leave at approximately 4 - 7am . The airport has significantly upgraded its facilities , which now includes air conditioning , x-ray machines and a renovated waiting area . It is assumed that this is because of the introduction of a new international flight to Cairns , Australia , operated by Airlines PNG . - The North Bismarck Plate is a small tectonic plate located in the Bismarck Sea off the northeast coast of New Guinea. - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji. - The Pacific Plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At , it is the largest tectonic plate. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - A forearc is the region between an oceanic trench and the associated volcanic arc. As such, forearc regions are found at convergent margins, and include any accretionary wedge and forearc basin that may be present. Due to tectonic stresses as one tectonic plate rides over another, forearc regions are sources for great thrust earthquakes - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is a huge oceanic plateau located in the south-west Pacific Ocean, north of the Solomon Islands. The OJP was emplaced 120 Ma with a much smaller volcanic event 90 Ma. Two other south-west Pacific plateaus, Manihiki and Hikurangi, now separated from the OJP by Cretaceous ocean basins, are of similar age and composition and probably formed as a single plateau and a contiguous large igneous province together with the OJP. When emplaced this Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau covered 1% of Earth's surface and represented a volume of of basaltic magma. This \\"Onotong Java event\\", first proposed in 1991, represents the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years, with a magma emplacement rate estimated at up to /year over three million years, several times larger than the Deccan Traps. The smooth surface of the OJP is punctuated by seamounts such as the Ontong Java Atoll, the largest atoll in the world. - In 2000 it had a population of 254,158. it had a population of 364,145, giving it an annual growth rate of 2.1% over a nine-year period.

As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, the hiring process is becoming more complex. More and more companies are turning to psychological (or personality) assessments to determine whether someone is the right fit for the job. Do some serious thinking about the qualifications that are necessary for the particular job that requires the test. For example, if you are seeking a job as an executive or upper-management, the interviewers will want to make sure that you have strong leadership skills and are an excellent communicator. If you are applying for a job such as a police officer, candidates will be expected to exhibit an ability to deal with high levels of stress and think on their feet. Psychological exams are essentially an assessment of your personality. Think about why you are applying for this job. It is probably because you feel that you are qualified and have the right disposition for this particular career. For example, if you are applying for a sales job, you know that a portion of your income will be generated by commission. Therefore, you need to be highly motivated. Does that sound like you? Reflect on your personality traits before the test. This will help you be prepared to formulate answers that fit the role. It's important that you be yourself when answering questions. But you should also remember that you are being evaluated. For example, if you were asked, \\"If you knew you would not get caught, would you steal from the company?\\", you should answer \\"No.\\" Even if you know that you might consider stealing, that is not something you would want to say during an interview. During the interview process, you need to not only highlight your strengths, but you need to convey how you can specifically benefit your future employer. Think about what you can do to improve the productivity of the company. If you are conscious of the company's needs, this will likely be reflected in your personality test. Before your test, feel free to ask the recruiter or HR representative what characteristics are most important on them. Then you can focus your answers on conveying those traits. It is impossible to predict the content of the test. However, you can prepare yourself by getting comfortable with the format. Be aware that most psychological exams consist of a face to face interview and a written questionnaire. You can search for practice tests online. Make sure to choose one from a reputable site that has solid psychology credentials. You can also hire a consultant to give you an in person practice exam. This person will then provide you with analysis and helpful hints.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What symbolizes Saint George on the British flag? Context: Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow. Red is prominently featured in the flag of the United States Marine Corps.","completion":"The symbol that represents Saint George on the British flag is the cross of Saint George, which is red on white."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was given borough status in the United Kingdom? ? Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester. Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford.

Write the answer: \\"What year did students at Oxford University organise the first university \\"\\"athletic sports\\"\\" meeting?\\"","completion":"The first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting at Oxford University was organized in 1860. The event marked a significant milestone in the history of sports at educational institutions, paving the way for future generations of student-athletes and the development of organized sports within universities. During the mid-19th century, there was a growing interest in athletics and physical education within schools and universities. Physical activity and sports were increasingly being recognized as essential components for the development of well-rounded and healthy individuals. As a result, various athletic clubs started forming at educational institutions across England, with Oxford University being one of the pioneers in this movement. The event in 1860, which took place on May 23, was organized by students from the university who shared a common interest in sports and athletic competition. These students sought to create an environment that encouraged friendly competition, camaraderie, and the development of athletic skills among their peers. The first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting featured track and field events, which were already popular in England. These included running races of various distances, jumping events such as the long jump and high jump, and throwing events like the shot put and hammer throw. The event was held at the University Parks, a spacious area with plenty of room for both competitors and spectators. The successful organization of the first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting at Oxford University in 1860 set a precedent for other universities around the world. Soon, similar events began taking place at universities in the United States and other countries, ultimately leading to the establishment of international multi-sport competitions, such as the modern Olympic Games. As the popularity of university sports continued to grow throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, intercollegiate athletic organizations were established to oversee the governance, rules, and regulations of sports at colleges and universities. In the United Kingdom, the British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS) was founded, while in the United States, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was established. In conclusion, the first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting at Oxford University in 1860 played a vital role in the history of organized sports at educational institutions. It demonstrated the importance of physical activity and competition in the development of well-rounded individuals, fostering a spirit of camaraderie and cooperation that continues to permeate university sports to this day. The legacy of that event lives on, as the passion for athletic competition and excellence still thrives in universities all over the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Of course I was. I got to like them. They were wicked, maybe, but I felt like they were really normal guys, that they didn't really realize it. But I knew they were.

I can use this background: Carbon monoxide is used in modified atmosphere packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat. Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%. Now, I have a new situation: Mike went to his local grocery store. He noticed that meats had two different packaging, product A and product B. When he looked closely, he found that in product A packaging carbon monoxide was used, but in product B carbon monoxide was not used. He asked the store clerk what difference it made. Answer this question please: Which product would less likely look fresher, product A or product B?","completion":"Product B, which does not use carbon monoxide in its packaging, would be less likely to look fresher compared to product A. The absence of carbon monoxide in product B's packaging means that the myoglobin in the meat can oxidize to form metmyoglobin, which has a brown pigment. This can cause the meat to appear less fresh over time. On the other hand, product A uses carbon monoxide in its packaging to form carboxymyoglobin, which maintains a bright-cherry-red pigment and allows the meat to retain a fresher appearance for a longer period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because trees serve multiple essential functions in an ecosystem. Some of these functions include: 1. Providing oxygen: Through the process of photosynthesis, trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which is essential for the survival of many organisms, including humans. 2. Supporting biodiversity: Trees provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. Birds, insects, small mammals, and various plant species all benefit from the presence of trees. This, in turn, helps create a more balanced and healthy ecosystem. 3. Preventing soil erosion: The extensive root systems of trees help to stabilize the soil, thereby reducing erosion and sediment runoff. This helps to maintain the quality of the land and can prevent water pollution in nearby rivers, lakes, and oceans. 4. Regulating local climate: Trees can help regulate the local climate by providing shade and reducing the urban heat island effect. This can help to keep habitats cool and comfortable for various organisms. 5. Acting as a carbon sink: Trees absorb and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. 6. Improving water quality: Trees can improve water quality by reducing pollutants and sediments, as well as capturing and filtering rainwater through their root systems. While some other options like planting grass and trimming trees can also positively impact ecosystems, their effects are comparably smaller. Planting grass can contribute to soil stabilization and increase the green cover, but trees provide a wider range of benefits, and trimming trees is a maintenance activity that can help maintain a tree's health while ensuring its benefits are sustained."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Today, many of his writings are included in school textbooks and his works are read by millions around the world. Born in 1881 to rich family, Lu Xun had a happy childhood. In 1893, however, his grandfather was put into prison for taking money. At the same time, his father became seriously ill. From that time on, his family were no longer accepted by their relatives and friends. These early experiences greatly influenced his writing. By the time Lu Xun arrived in Nanjing to study at a college in 1899, he already believed that Chinese government had to change and become modern. In 1902 he went to study in Japan. There he began writing articles for some Chinese student magazines. He showed a gift for writing and translating and he even wrote several books, though none was popular. He returned to China in 1909 because he was in need of money. After working for a few years as a teacher in Beijing, Lu Xun again returned to writing. In 1918, he wrote his famous short story Diary of a Madman. It was the first Chinese novel using the everyday language that people spoke, which helped make it a great success. _ , together with his novel The True Story of Ah Q(1921), made Lu Xun a leading Chinese writer. Though successful, Lu Xun still worried greatly about China's future. In 1926, he moved to Shanghai and gave up writing stories.

A prosecutor did his best to ensure that when he convinced a Maryland jury that Evans was among the worst of the worst, a killer who deserved a punishment more severe than a life spent in prison. He deserved, the prosecutor argued and the jury agreed, to die at the hands of the state. That was nearly 30 years ago. In the years since, the motel where Evans gunned down two employees has been replaced by a Howard Johnson. The star witness in the case, a woman who lost her husband and a sister that day, has died. And Evans, who in his own words has “rebuilt” his character, remains on Maryland’s death row, kept alive in a politically forged purgatory. “In hindsight, it would have been better if he got life without parole,” David B. Irwin, the former prosecutor who handled the case, said recently. “But it wasn’t obvious to us as young prosecutors back then that this was the way it was going to turn out.” As the state Senate prepares to vote this week on whether Maryland should abolish capital punishment, the Evans case illustrates what can happen when the death penalty exists but is not enforced. Unlike Virginia, which has executed more than 100 people since 1976, including one man last month, Maryland has executed five people since it reinstituted the death penalty in 1978, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. No one has been executed in Maryland since 2005. What is essentially a moratorium on capital punishment has been in place in Maryland since 2006, and since 2009, the state has required DNA evidence, a videotaped crime or a videotaped confession in capital cases. Of the five men on Maryland’s death row, Evans and two others have been there for nearly three decades. In that time, Evans has survived a stabbing, come within hours of execution and outlived the widow he left haunted by a burst of gunfire that was meant for her but killed her sister. Even some of the people who most wanted to see Evans dead no longer do, although not because of any sympathy for him. “If [Evans] got executed tomorrow, it wouldn’t bother me a bit,” Irwin said. But he won’t, and for Irwin, that’s the problem with the state’s death penalty. “I’m not morally, religiously or legally against the death penalty,” he said. “It’s on grounds of practicality. It becomes ridiculous and ludicrous after 30 years. If they’re not going to impose the death penalty, why have it on the books?” Evans was 33 and a drug addict in April 1983 when authorities say he agreed to kill two federal witnesses, Scott Piechowicz and his wife, Cheryl. The two worked at the Warren House Motel in Pikes­ville, in Baltimore County,and were set to testify against a drug dealer named Anthony Grandison. Heroin and cocaine had been found in one of the motel’s rooms, and only the couple could tie Grandison to it. It was Evans’s job to silence them, and authorities say that for 9,000 he tried to do so by walking into the motel lobby and firing a Mac-11 machine gun. Six bullets hit Piechowicz and four hit his sister-in-law, Susan Kennedy, who had agreed at the last minute to work for Cheryl. Years later, after the remarried Cheryl died, husband Bob Bradshaw told The Washington Post that she had read Piechowicz’s autopsy so often she memorized the placement of the bullets, the organs they damaged and the size of the holes they made. She also suffered recurring nightmares about her sister, he said: “Her sister’d come up to her in a halter top. And she got six or seven bullets right in the heart. And she’d see the bullet holes, and Cheryl would say, ‘Susan, you can’t walk around with that on — people can see the bullet holes.’ And Susan would look at her and say, ‘That’s right, Cheryl, because I want everyone to see what you did to me.’ ” Dana M. Levitz, the prosecutor who tried Grandison and eventually became a Maryland Circuit Court judge, said that as a prosecutor he had asked juries six times for the death penalty and that each time it was granted. None of those men, including Grandison, has been executed, Levitz said. Instead, he has seen the appeals process extend cases for many years. “The most difficult part of it,” he said, “was dealing with the effect it had on innocent people, the effect it had on victims’ families and the effect it had on the defendants’ families.” These days, Grandison, Evans and the other three condemned men are housed in a maximum-security prison in Cumberland. It is one of the few facilities in the nation where death-row inmates live among the general population, said Warden Bobby P. Shearin. At the prison, where 1,000 of the 1,400 inmates are serving life sentences, those on death row have their own cells, but otherwise, they walk the same beige halls as everyone else and follow the same meal schedule: breakfast at 4 a.m, dinner at 3:30 p.m. Officials denied a request from The Post to interview death-row inmates, but in a letter to The Post, Evans described the prison as a place where decent food is scarce — “I have learned to love peanut butter, sardines and beans from the commissary” — and where he and the others on death row share a tier with mentally ill inmates. “So just imagine loud noises,” he writes. “Men getting mace. Men being drag out their cells. Men playing in their waste.” “A man on death row in the State of Maryland has to have a strong will within and a God to have faith in.” James McEachin, a pastor who grew up with Evans, describes him as an intelligent man who fell into drugs early. But he is not a killer, said McEachin, who thinks that someone other than Evans was the shooter. Over the years, Evans’s supporters have picketed, spoken to lawmakers and at one point formed the Committee to Save Vernon Evans. Evans has spoken by phone to area college students through a program called Live from Death Row. At one point, Evans’s words appeared on a blog titled “Meet Vernon.” In 2006, he received a stay 11 hours before he was to be executed. McEachin said he has visited Evans on death row and prayed through “plexiglass that has got to be at least six inches thick.” In his letter, Evans describes transferring from one prison to another — and from state to state — over the years, each with its own set of challenges. In one, he says, he had to walk with his hand over his heart because “Cubans were wanting to get a murder charge just to stay in the country.” In another, he was stabbed seven times by a man he was teaching to read. When he was placed in the Maryland prison system in 2002, he writes, he “had been living with the company of death for 18 years.” Gov. Martin O’Malley’s proposal to repeal the death penalty — as 17 other states have done — appears on track to pass in the Senate and the House of Delegates. But the bill would affect only future cases. The legislation cannot be applied retroactively to the men on death row because of constitutional concerns, said Raquel Guillory, a spokeswoman for the governor. O’Malley (D) would have options. He could commute all or some of the death sentences to life without parole; he could issue an executive order staying all death warrants; he could do nothing and leave the inmates in the hands of future governors. At a hearing this month, O’Malley told lawmakers that he would “decide each of those cases as they ripen.” Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said the average time between sentencing and execution is 15 years. Thirty years is rare. “It’s time to just say enough is enough,” said Jane Henderson, executive director of Maryland Citizens Against State Executions. “The problem with the death penalty is it’s a Catch-22. Everything you do to make it fairer is only going to make the process longer and more torturous for the very people we say we do it for.” Catherine Kennedy said she thinks the waiting led to an early death for her brother, John Kennedy, who lost daughter Susan in the motel shooting and had to watch daughter Cheryl endure the court proceedings and appeals for Evans and Grandison. “My brother could not forgive them, and his life just faded away,” Kennedy, 74, said. “I think my brother would very much have liked to be the executioner.” Kennedy said some of her relatives would still like to see Evans and Grandison executed and that at one point she would have joined her brother, a police sergeant, in performing the task. But she now teaches the Bible and said her view has changed. She thinks the men are evil. “And I want God to get rid of evil,” she said. “However, I don’t think he gave me that power.” John Kennedy, 59, died of cancer in 1998. Cheryl, 38, died the same year of a congenital defect that limited blood flow to her brain. Evans and Grandison “destroyed my brother’s family,” Kennedy said. “My brother was one of the best men on the face of the Earth. He was good, loving, gentle. “I think had my brother murdered [Evans and Grandison],” she said, “God would have forgiven him.” After the trial, Irwin find out that John Kennedy was never searched at the courthouse and sat in court with his police-issued firearm at his side. Irwin said he has since questioned the restraint it must have taken for Kennedy to leave the fate of Grandison and Evans to the justice system. “He believed in the system and the system didn’t work for him,” Irwin said. “I wonder what he would have done if he’d known he would die before they did.” John Wagner and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report.

Write some highlights for the following article: A day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court when a judge revoked his bail, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf appeared before a magistrate on Friday and was formally placed under house arrest. The development is the latest setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections. His arrest also highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary, who clashed with Musharraf during his time in power, to pursue cases against high-profile figures previously considered to be untouchable. No former Pakistani army chief has previously been arrested and detained. Amid a long-running fight with the judiciary, Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan last month under heavy security. But so far, his return does not seem to be going according to plan. Earlier this week, Pakistani election officials barred Musharraf from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month, a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge. That decision appears to have emboldened members of the judiciary, many of whom have bitter memories of their treatment by Musharraf during his time in power. But the legal drama concerning a former head of the army appeared to be fueling concerns about how the powerful Pakistani military might respond, with the country under the management of a caretaker government ahead of the elections next month. \\"The fears that the army might sharply react if the cases are taken to their logical conclusion hang in the air,\\" The Nation, an English language newspaper, wrote in an editorial Friday. \\"But Pakistan is now irrevocably destined for a democratic transition, and on this, all institutions agree.\\" Accused of detaining judges. The Islamabad High Court had ordered Musharraf's arrest on Thursday in a case in which he is accused of illegally ordering the detention of senior judges in 2007. The high court said in its ruling that it was an \\"act of terrorism\\" to prevent the judges from doing their job. But he quickly left the building after the judge announced the decision, returning to his farmhouse compound outside the Pakistani capital. His legal status at that point was unclear. Local media reported he had been placed under house arrest, but the judge's order for his arrest remained outstanding. On Friday morning, local broadcaster Geo TV broadcast images of Musharraf arriving at a court building accompanied by uniformed police officers and other members of the security forces. Pakistani authorities have provided some of his heavy security detail since his return. Islamabad police spokesman Naeem Iqbal said officers had formally arrested Musharraf and produced him before a magistrate in court. But Mohammad Amjad, a spokesman for Musharraf's political party said the former president had presented himself in court. He said Musharraf denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007. Farmhouse arrest. After appearing before the magistrate on Friday, Musharraf was allowed to return to his farmhouse, which has been converted into a \\"sub jail\\" where he is being held under house arrest, according to his lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori. Musharraf will continue to seek bail in the case, Qasoori said. An attempt on Thursday to appeal the Islamabad court's decision at the Supreme Court appeared to have so far been unsuccessful. Qasoori said that Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the Islamabad High Court judge who ordered Musharraf's arrest, is one of the judges whom Musharraf is alleged to have had detained in 2007. As a result, Qasoori said, Siddiqui should have recused himself from the case. Siddiqui wasn't immediately available for comment on Friday. In another step in the process, Musharraf will have to appear in court again next week. He had previously received bail extensions in the cases concerning him. He was also initially granted \\"protective\\" bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to Pakistan. But the judiciary appears to have taken a more aggressive line than he may have expected, stepping up the pursuit of cases against him. When asked last week about his fears of arrest, Musharraf brushed the question aside. A mixed reception in Pakistan. Musharraf was disqualified from contesting elections in Pakistan because of the state of emergency he declared in 2007. Even though he hasn't been tried for that action, the move was ruled an act of treason, making him ineligible to run for office. Musharraf maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts. Some Pakistanis are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler, hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence. But he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency, notably among the judges he allegedly detained. The Pakistani Taliban vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country, though Musharraf has said he has been living under threats of death since September 11, 2001, when he supported the American war on terror and fought against the Taliban. The former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for \\"misuse of authority.\\" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence a court decision on whether he could seek another term in office. CNN's Nic Robertson and journalist Nasir Habib reported from Islamabad. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","completion":"1.

Please find a more comprehensive and detailed answer below: Schahzenan, the Sultan Shahryar's brother, attempted to oust him from the throne through multiple strategies. The first instance was by planning a coup d'état along with Shahryar's wife. However, this plot ended in failure when Shahryar accidentally killed his wife during the chaos of the coup. This event led to Shahryar's madness and his distrust of women, ingraining in him the belief that they were plotting to kill him. Later on, when Schahzenan became aware of Shahryar's inability to execute his new wife, Scheherazade, he saw this as a sign of weakness. He took advantage of this perceived vulnerability by gathering his army and marching toward Baghdad. His goal was to use military force to seize power from his brother and claim the throne for himself. However, by the time Schahzenan's army reached Baghdad, Scheherazade's plan of telling stories with hidden morals had successfully cured Shahryar of his madness, and he had fallen in love with her.

Under the control of a spider-like creature, he becomes embroiled in a battle between powerful corporations and an underground rebellion. Act 1: In the sprawling metropolis of New Athens, a series of mysterious attacks on high-ranking corporate officials has left the city on edge. Walker, a skilled but elusive bounty hunter, has been tasked with bringing the perpetrators to justice. He is equipped with a state-of-the-art suit and helmet that provide him with valuable tools such as AI assistance, advanced weaponry, and enhanced physical abilities, making him the perfect man for the job. Walker is briefed on the situation by his enigmatic employer, Mr. Harlow, who controls the most powerful corporations in the city.

Fearing the rise of an unseen enemy, Harlow charges Walker with the responsibility of finding those responsible and eliminating the threat. Act 2: As Walker goes about his investigation, he stumbles upon an underground rebellion led by a fearless leader named Kasumi. The rebels believe that their society has become too dependent on technology and that the corporations hold too much power.

In the end, Walker manages to defeat Harlow, release the incriminating evidence against him, and shut down the Cyberarachnid program. In a final, fateful decision, Dr. Sinclair removes the Cyberarachnid from Walker's body, risking permanent damage to his mind. As Walker slips into unconsciousness, he finds solace in knowing that he has successfully disrupted the system that sought to control him and others like him.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mao Zedong belonged to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the People's War. Established in 1921, the CCP played a significant role in the Chinese Civil War, which was fought primarily between the Communists and the Nationalists, led by the Kuomintang (KMT). Mao Zedong was one of the founding members of the party and a key figure in its leadership. He adhered to Marxism-Leninism and played a pivotal role in strategizing and leading the party's military and political efforts against Japanese invasion and fighting the KMT-led Nationalist government. The People's War, also known as the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, occurred from 1937 to 1945. During this period, the CCP, under Mao's leadership, cooperated with the KMT in a united front against the Japanese invasion. Although the CCP and KMT had temporarily suspended their hostilities to face the Japanese threat, their underlying tensions and ideological differences persisted. Once the Chinese Civil War resumed following the end of World War II, Mao Zedong led the CCP to victory against the KMT in 1949, resulting in the establishment of the People's Republic of China with Mao as its first leader. The CCP, to which Mao Zedong belonged, has been the ruling political party in China ever since."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Simplify both sides of the equation. 2. Isolate variable (v) on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for v. Let's begin: 1. Simplify both sides of the equation: On the left-hand side, we can combine the numbers: 1712 * v - 12300 + 1089 = 1712 * v - 11211 On the right-hand side, we can combine the numbers as well: -2986 + 5471 = 2485 Now, the simplified equation is: 1712 * v - 11211 = 2485 2. Isolate variable (v) on one side of the equation: Adding 11211 to both sides to move the constant term from the left-hand side to the right-hand side: 1712 * v - 11211 + 11211 = 2485 + 11211 Then we get: 1712 * v = 13696 3. Solve for v: Divide both sides of the equation by 1712 (the constant coefficient of v): 1712 * v / 1712 = 13696 / 1712 We are left with: v = 8 So the solution for v in the equation 1712 * v - 12300 + 1089 = -2986 + 5471 is v = 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was quite skilled in crafting stories set in ancient times, using elaborate language and period-specific details. However, Dennis struggled to create engaging and relatable narratives that appealed to the contemporary reader. Recognizing Dennis's talent and potential, Brett, a successful modern-day author, decided to lend a hand. They first met to discuss the premise of the story, where they brainstormed ideas and settled upon a mystery set in a bustling city. Keeping contemporary elements in mind, they outlined a plot featuring a tech-savvy detective who used social media, GPS, and cutting-edge gadgets to uncover clues and solve the case. Next, they worked on character development, ensuring that each character was multifaceted and adequately represented the diversity of the modern world. This included creating backstories, motivations, relationships, and dialogue that would captivate readers and evoke a sense of familiarity. As they moved on to writing the actual narrative, Brett guided Dennis in using a more contemporary writing style, focusing on concise and clear language without sacrificing the elegance and eloquence that defined Dennis's work. Brett showed Dennis the importance of pacing and setting up compelling plot twists to keep the readers engaged. During revisions, Brett and Dennis worked together to refine the story, ensuring that it maintained the essence of a gripping mystery while staying relevant to modern readers. They added cultural references and current events, imbuing the story with a sense of timeliness that would resonate with their audience. Finally, they reviewed the manuscript together, making necessary adjustments and polishing the text to perfection. With Brett's guidance, Dennis had successfully transitioned from an archaic writer to one capable of crafting an enthralling modern-day mystery. The collaborative efforts of Brett and Dennis resulted in a novel that captivated readers, blending the timeless charm of an intricately woven mystery with the relatability of contemporary storytelling. This experience not only opened new doors for Dennis but also served as a testament to the power of creativity and collaboration in the ever-evolving world of literature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Pope Benedict XVI called on European leaders to spur economic growth by countering the wealth gaps between their countries with the same determination used to reduce the “spreads” among member state’s borrowing costs. “If the differential index between financial rates represents a source of concern, the increasing differences between those few who grow ever richer and the many who grow hopelessly poorer, should be a cause for dismay,” he said in an address to diplomats at the Vatican today. “It is a question of refusing to be resigned to a ‘spread’ in social well-being, while at the same time fighting one in the financial sector.” The 85-year-old pontiff and other leading figures of the Catholic Church often use financial terms, concepts and references in speeches on the state of the economy. In 2010, Benedict called on businessmen to put profits earned from production and services back into the “real economy” rather than seeking a “quick return on the financial markets.” The year before, Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said that free-market economics legitimized greed, citing the 1987 movie “Wall Street” and its famous line that “greed is good, greed is right.” At the outset of the global financial crisis in November 2008, then Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti said Benedict had pronounced a “prophecy” in a 1985 paper stating that a decline in ethics may “cause the laws of the market to collapse.” In his 2009 encyclical “Caritas in Veritate,” Latin for “Charity in Truth,” the pope laid out his thoughts on capitalism and ways out of the worst recession since World War II. The European Union “requires far-sighted representatives capable of making the difficult choices necessary to rectify its economy and to lay solid foundations for growth,” the pope said today. “Alone, certain countries may perhaps advance more quickly, but together, all will certainly go further,” he said, referring to the risks of a break-up in the euro region.

In addition to issues such as bond market yields and interest rates, world leaders should focus on \\"the increasing differences between those few who grow ever richer and the many who grow hopelessly poorer, \`' Benedict said, promoting the Catholic church's social teaching, which advocates special attention to the needy. The financial crisis took root, he said, \`'because profit was all too often made absolute, to the detriment of labor, and because of unrestrained ventures in the financial areas of the economy, rather than attending to the real economy.\\" He urged people to resist the temptations for \`'short-term interests\\" at the expense of the common good. Benedict also revisited one of his most pressing worries of late: the use of religion as a pretext for violence. He said \`'baneful religious fanaticism\\" has produced many victims.

Intrigued, he follows her and returns a garter belt she overlooked. Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls.

The Russian Armed Forces were formed in 1992. - NATO reporting names are code names for military equipment of Russia, China, and, historically, the former Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union and other nations of the Warsaw Pact). They provide unambiguous and easily understood English words in a uniform manner in place of the original designations, which either may have been unknown to the Western world at the time or easily confused codes. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - The Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (GRAU) is a department of the Russian (ex-Soviet) Ministry of Defense. It is subordinate to the Chief of Armament and Munition of the Russian Armed Forces, a vice-minister of defense. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. - The Warsaw Pact, formally the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance and sometimes, informally, WarPac. was a collective defense treaty among the Soviet Union and seven other Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.

Ask a question about European Central Bank.","completion":"What is the role and function of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the European Union and how does it manage and influence the economic policies within the Eurozone? The European Central Bank (ECB) is the central bank for the Eurozone, a coalition of 19 European Union (EU) member states who have adopted the Euro as their common currency. Established in 1998 and headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, the ECB operates under a framework defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The ECB, together with the central banks of the Eurozone countries, constitute the Eurosystem. The institution's primary responsibility is maintaining price stability and securing the value of the Euro. It aims to keep the year-on-year increase in consumer prices below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. The ECB also has several key roles and functions in managing the monetary policies within the Eurozone: 1. Monetary Policy: This is the central role of the ECB. It is accountable for managing the monetary policy of the EU, intending to maintain price stability and control inflation. Key tools used include key interest rates, open market operations, minimum reserve requirements for banks, and providing liquidity. 2. Financial Stability and Supervision: The ECB maintains financial stability by supervising significant banks and financial institutions within the Eurozone under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). It aims to prevent banking crises and mitigate systematic risks. 3. Issuer of Currency: The ECB has the exclusive authority to authorise the issuance of Euro banknotes. Member countries' central banks issue these notes, which are put into circulation by the ECB. 4. Foreign Exchange: The ECB manages the foreign reserves of the Eurozone countries and can intervene in the foreign exchange markets to influence the exchange rate if needed for monetary policy purposes. 5. Economic Policies and Advice: The ECB advises EU institutions (like the European Commission and the European Parliament) on economic and monetary issues. It contributes to the creation of EU-level regulations and policies and provides assessments of EU member states' economic and budgetary plans. 6. Financial Market Infrastructure: The ECB promotes the safety and efficiency of payment, securities settlement, and clearing systems. It also develops related infrastructure projects, such as TARGET2 (for real-time gross settlement) and T2S (for securities settlements in central bank money). The ECB operates independently of national governments, but it’s accountable to the European Parliament and holds regular dialogues with institutional partners, academics, and civil society. This way, the ECB contributes significantly to the financial and economic stability within the Eurozone."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: Where Are Mahindra Tractors Made Suggested answer: With this sponsorship, Mahindra was the first Indian company to sponsor a car in NASCAR.

(B). Neil was a nice person..","completion":"People liked being around Jeffrey more than around Neil because Jeffrey was a nice person. This preference can be attributed to a variety of factors that set Jeffrey apart from Neil, even if both of them were nice individuals in their own right. First and foremost, Jeffrey tended to exude a warm, welcoming energy that instantly put people at ease. His open body language and friendly demeanor contributed to an atmosphere of trust, allowing others to be their authentic selves without fear of judgment or criticism. This sincerity enabled deeper connections to form quickly between Jeffrey and those around him, fostering a sense of camaraderie that would elude Neil. In addition to his genuineness, Jeffrey had a knack for active listening and made people feel heard and valued. He often gave his undivided attention to others when they spoke, nodding and occasionally interjecting with thoughtful comments or questions. This made people feel that Jeffrey was not only interested in what they had to say but that he was invested in their well-being and cared about their personal experiences. Furthermore, Jeffrey had a unique ability to empathize with others and be sensitive to their feelings and emotions. This made him an indispensable confidant to those in need, as people could trust him with their most vulnerable thoughts and emotions, knowing he would provide a caring, nonjudgmental response. Jeffrey was also known for his inclusiveness, making a conscious effort to involve everyone in conversations and activities. He intuitively picked up on those who felt left out or uncomfortable and made strides to integrate them within the group. This created an atmosphere of belonging that allowed people to thrive, in contrast to Neil, who might not have had this same level of awareness or concern for other people's feelings. Moreover, Jeffrey had a great sense of humor and was able to make people laugh even during tough times. His playfulness and lightheartedness were contagious, filling those around him with joy and happiness. This ability to spread positivity made it easy for people to gravitate towards him, while Neil might not have shared this same trait. While Neil might also be a nice person with his own unique qualities, people overall tended to feel more connected, cared for, and appreciated in the presence of Jeffrey. His genuine kindness, active listening, empathy, inclusiveness, and sense of humor set him apart from others, creating an environment where people felt comfortable, valued, and ultimately preferred being around him."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Many types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them (e.g. NERVA) tested for spacecraft applications. can we use nuclear power to propel spaceships?","completion":"Yes, nuclear power can be used to propel spaceships, and it has been a subject of extensive research since the dawn of the space age. Nuclear propulsion offers several advantages over conventional chemical propulsion systems. It provides much higher energy density, which means that a nuclear-powered spacecraft can carry less fuel mass for a given mission, resulting in substantial weight savings. Additionally, nuclear propulsion can offer higher effective exhaust velocities, which translates into greater potential mission speeds and the ability to perform more demanding maneuvers. Several types of nuclear propulsion systems have been proposed and studied for spacecraft applications, such as nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and nuclear pulse propulsion (NPP). Some of these have undergone physical testing, like the NERVA project. 1. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP): In an NTP system, a nuclear reactor is used to heat a propellant, such as hydrogen, to extremely high temperatures. The heated propellant expands rapidly through a nozzle, generating thrust. The advantage of an NTP system is its high specific impulse (a measure of propellant efficiency), which can be more than twice that of conventional chemical rockets. The most famous NTP project was the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA), which was an American program that operated during the 1960s. The program successfully tested several nuclear rocket engines, but it was ultimately canceled due to budgetary constraints and shifting priorities towards other space exploration methods. 2. Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP): NEP systems use nuclear reactors to generate electricity, which is then used to drive electrically-powered thrusters. The most common type of thruster used in NEP systems is the ion thruster, which uses electric fields to accelerate ions to incredibly high speeds. While the thrust produced by NEP systems is relatively low, they provide exceptional specific impulse and fuel efficiency, allowing spacecraft to achieve high velocities over long-duration missions. The main disadvantage of NEP systems is their relatively low thrust-to-weight ratio, making them unsuitable for high-thrust applications like Earth launches. However, they can be excellent for missions such as deep space explorations and interplanetary travel. 3. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion (NPP): NPP systems utilize a series of controlled nuclear explosions to propel a spacecraft. The most well-known NPP concept was Project Orion, which proposed detonating nuclear bombs behind the spacecraft, with each explosion pushing the craft forward. A pusher plate would absorb the impact of the explosion and convert it into forward motion. Although the concept has significant theoretical advantages, such as extremely high specific impulse and the ability to carry large payloads, there are numerous potential downsides. These include the radiation hazards of launching a nuclear bomb-powered spaceship, the environmental impact of nuclear explosions, and the political implications of deploying such a technology. Overall, nuclear propulsion systems offer significant advantages for space travel and spacecraft capabilities. However, there are also challenges to overcome, such as dealing with the radiation emitted from the reactors, managing the heat generated by the system, and addressing safety concerns. Regulatory issues and public perception of nuclear power are also factors that need to be considered. In conclusion, we can use nuclear power to propel spaceships, and there is a wealth of research and development undertaken in this field. However, additional advancements in technology, safety systems, and public acceptance will be needed before widespread use of nuclear-powered spacecraft becomes a reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. But I can use this background: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. What is an answer for this question: Which chair has a higher air pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The green chair has a higher air pressure. To justify this answer, let's consider the given situation step-by-step: 1. We have two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom. 2. The only difference between the chairs is their color. 3. Patrick and Mark are allowed to use the chairs, with Patrick sitting on the red chair and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, sitting on the green chair. Given the background information on Boyle's law, we know that decreasing the volume of a gas (if the temperature is held constant) increases its pressure. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, he would compress the air volume in the green chair more than Patrick compresses the air volume in the red chair. This results in a decreased volume for the air inside the green chair as compared to the red chair. As a consequence, the air pressure inside the green chair becomes higher than the air pressure inside the red chair, according to Boyle's law."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Abstract: Although blood–brain barrier (BBB) compromise is central to the etiology of diverse central nervous system (CNS) disorders, endothelial receptor proteins that control BBB function are poorly defined. The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt–β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt–β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption..

Summarize this article: Put forth effort into the relationship and work hard to make it work. Communicate openly with your partner about your goals for the relationship and where you see it going. If you're only interested in a short-term fling, be honest. If you've got an eye toward serious long-term love, be honest. There's nothing wrong with either kind of love, but you need to make sure that your partner is equally committed to the same version of love that you are. Commit to the person and to the relationship. Put in work to make your partner feel special, and work toward making the relationship work. The word \\"intimacy\\" is often associated with sex, but being emotionally intimate is a huge part of a loving relationship. Emotional intimacy involves allowing yourself to feel and express vulnerability around your partner. Avoiding vulnerability can look like withdrawal, attack, or accusations. On the contrary, intimacy can look like sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Feelings or situations that previously felt unsafe feel safer in an intimate relationship because of the vulnerability and trust that has been developed. When you begin to feel vulnerable (like experiencing fear, sadness, shame, or hurt), take a moment and pause. Acknowledge whatever feelings come up and allow yourself to feel them; don’t avoid them. Take compassion on the feeling and be gentle with it. Share your vulnerable moments and let your partner support you. If you’re concerned that the initial attraction and strong feelings of love are wearing off, realize that love can occur in waves. Sometimes you feel overwhelmingly in love with someone, and other times you experience less love to or from that person. Just because you hit a low point doesn’t mean that the feelings will last forever. Life happens in cycles, and it’s okay that love experiences highs and lows. Lots of things can create peaks and troughs in love, such as having children or growing older. You can work through them. You don’t have to be the one in control of the love in your relationship; let your partner express love toward you. Receiving love can feel vulnerable to some people because it requires letting go of control. Be open to receiving gifts, accepting compliments, and warm gestures toward you. You may feel like you now owe something back, but let that go and enjoy the experience of receiving. Love does not have debts but multiplies. Touching does not need to be sexual, but engaging in a long, supportive hug or reaching out for your partner’s hand is a way to stay connected. Express your love for your partner by initiating and sustaining physical contact. Affection is one way to express care, appreciation, and other connecting, positive emotions. Affection is a way to make your partner feel loved and for you to feel loving. Sometimes the way we communicate with a partner can be lost in translation, but gratitude is always understood. Affirm your appreciation of your partner by expressing gratitude. Thank your partner for showing that you notice the effort put into the relationship. Show appreciation for the things your partner does, and also for the qualities that your loved one embodies. The whole point of going through life with people you love is so that you can tackle life’s challenges together. Work together to find solutions, solve problems, and comfort each other when times get tough. We can’t solve everything on our own, we can’t know everything there is to know... but a whole bunch of people getting together out of love can solve just about any problem.","completion":"This article talks about how to have a good relationship with someone you love.

Problem:LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \\"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it.

Context: It may seem as though the 2020 U.S. presidential election is a long way off. But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" Question: What is probably true about Elizabeth Warren?

As a Massachusetts Senator, she has shown concern about the party's struggle to win back control of Congress due to long-standing Republican advantages in the House of Representatives. Warren believes that embracing the anger and fear felt by millions of Americans towards the current administration is crucial for the Democratic Party's success in future elections, rather than ignoring these sentiments.

News article: Berlusconi: Except for anti-Jewish laws, Mussolini did much good; defends support of Hitler ROME – Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi praised Benito Mussolini for \\"having done good\\" despite the Fascist dictator's anti-Jewish laws, immediately sparking expressions of outrage as Europe on Sunday held Holocaust remembrances. Berlusconi also defended Mussolini for allying himself with Hitler, saying he likely reasoned that it would be better to be on the winning side. The media mogul, whose conservative forces are polling second in voter surveys ahead of next month's election, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony in Milan to commemorate the Holocaust. In 1938, before the outbreak of World War II, Mussolini's regime passed the so-called \\"racial laws,\\" barring Jews from Italy's universities and many professions, among other bans. When Germany's Nazi regime occupied Italy during the war, thousands from the tiny Italian Jewish community were deported to death camps. \\"It is difficult now to put oneself in the shoes of who was making decisions back then,\\" Berlusconi said of Mussolini's support for Hitler. \\"Certainly the (Italian) government then, fearing that German power would turn into a general victory, preferred to be allied with Hitler's Germany rather that oppose it.\\" Berlusconi added that \\"within this alliance came the imposition of the fight against, and extermination of, the Jews. Thus, the racial laws are the worst fault of Mussolini, who, in so many other aspects, did good.\\" More than 7,000 Jews were deported under Mussolini's regime, and nearly 6,000 of them were killed. Reactions of outrage, along with a demand that Berlusconi be prosecuted for promoting Fascism, quickly followed his words. Berlusconi's praise of Mussolini constitutes \\"an insult to the democratic conscience of Italy,\\" said Rosy Bindi, a center-left leader. \\"Only Berlusconi's political cynicism, combined with the worst historic revisionism, could separate the shame of the racist laws from the Fascist dictatorship.\\" Italian laws enacted following the country's disastrous experience in the war forbid the encouragement of Fascism. A candidate for local elections, Gianfranco Mascia, pledged that he and his supporters will present a formal complaint on Monday to Italian prosecutors, seeking to have Berlusconi prosecuted. Advocating aggressive nationalism, Mussolini used brutish force and populist appeal evoking ancient Rome's glories to achieve and keep his dictatorial grip on power, starting in the early '20s and lasting well into World War II. His Fascist \\"blackshirt\\" loyalists cracked down on dissidents, through beatings and jailings. He encouraged big families to propagate the Italian population, established a sprawling state economy and erected monumental buildings and statues to evoke ancient Rome. Mussolini sought to impose order on a generally individualistic-minded people, and Italians sometimes note trains ran on time during Fascism. With dreams of an empire, he sent Italian troops on missions to attack or occupy foreign lands, including Ethiopia and Albania. Eventually, Italian military failures in Africa and in Greece fostered rebellion among Fascist officials, and in 1943 he was placed under arrest by orders of the Italian king. His end came at the vengeful hands of partisan fighters, who shot him and his mistress, and left their bodies to hang in a Milan square in April 1945. Berlusconi's former government allies have included political heirs to neo-fascist movements admiring Mussolini. In 2010, he told world leaders at a Paris conference that he had been reading Mussolini's journals, and years earlier Berlusconi had claimed that Mussolini \\"never killed anyone.\\" Berlusconi is running in Feb. 24-25 Parliamentary elections and has repeatedly changed his mind on whether he is seeking a fourth term as premier. Monti is also running, but polls put him far behind front-runner Pier Luigi Bersani, a center-left leader who supported Monti's austerity measures to save Italy from the Eurozone debt crisis.

This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You.

Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621.

What is the relationship between 'vassilis leventis' and 'messini'? Answer:","completion":"Vassilis Leventis and Messini share a connection through their origins and context within Greek politics and administrative divisions. Vassilis Leventis is a Greek politician who was born in Messene, Messenia, in 1951. He is the leader and founder of the Union of Centrists, a political party in Greece that follows a Centrism and Venizelism ideology while supporting Greece's integral part within the European Union.

We are told that from day one. Usually, that statement is followed by some remark about being a loser. If we do not care who wins, then why do we compete? Fun, experience, the chance to meet new people --- these are the reasons we try to outdo each other. People will compete over anything. Every Christmas, my neighbors and I have a little Christmas light competition. It is heaven for the electric company, but I think we give Will Rogers Airport a scare. It is bright enough to land a plane in our front yards. I admit that last year my neighbors won, but only because they bought every strand of lights Wal-Mart had before I could get there. Personal competitions are great, but we get a little carried away. I cannot stand to see coaches shout at kids playing sports. Who cares if someone messes up and the other team advances? I'm tired of people competing just to win. It happens not only in sports, but in music competitions, too. People auditioning for chair placement in certain bands can get really unfriendly. This year I did not audition for a certain band, but I went to auditions anyway. This was the first time I actually had the opportunity to comprehend the whole picture. Other times I've been the person who was nervous and anxious. This time, I sat back and observed everyone else. I came to the realization that the people who aren't so good are terrified of the good people, and the good people are scared stiff that the bad people have taken lessons and can now show them up. Unless a person is on the outside looking in, I don't think anyone realizes _ . Maybe competing is human nature, but we shouldn't let it influence our judgment. Being disrespectful to opponents , letting competition become our life, and becoming so involved that we close ourselves off from friends and family is not the meaning of competition. A little competition is healthy, so it shouldn't hurt anyone. If it does, someone somewhere needs to back off, find the good thing hidden inside, and try it again....
