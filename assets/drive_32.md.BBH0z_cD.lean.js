Question: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

The wind is coming from that quarter. Does the word \\"quarter\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"quarter\\" does not mean the same thing in the two sentences provided. In this context, \\"quarter\\" is used as a homograph. Homographs are words that are spelled the same but have different meanings and may have different pronunciations. Let's take a closer look at the two sentences to understand the different meanings of \\"quarter\\" in them: 1. \\"It's a quarter til 4.\\" In this sentence, \\"quarter\\" is used to indicate a unit of time, which is equal to 15 minutes. Saying \\"a quarter til 4\\" means that the time is 15 minutes before 4 o'clock or 3:45. This use of \\"quarter\\" is often found in relation to time and is intended to give an approximate time based on fractions of the hour. 2. \\"The wind is coming from that quarter.\\" In the second sentence, \\"quarter\\" refers to a direction or point of origin. Here, it is used to define one of the four cardinal points of direction or areas. The four quarters are typically understood as north, south, east, and west. When someone says, \\"the wind is coming from that quarter,\\" they mean that the wind is blowing from a particular direction or a specific segment of the compass. To sum up, the meanings of \\"quarter\\" in the two sentences are distinct from each other. In the first sentence, it is used to denote a unit of time (15 minutes), while in the second sentence, it refers to direction or a specific segment of the compass. These two examples demonstrate how a single word may have entirely different meanings depending on the context in which it appears."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries.They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa.The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor .The diseased children are usually from one to four years old.As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body.The skin changes colour and may break out in open sores.The hair changes colour and starts to fall out.The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time.Stomach liquids are no longer produced. The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat.Their mothers gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins.They found that the addition of milk to the food of children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.

Information: - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea. - The Norwegian School of Economics or NHH is a business school situated in Bergen, Norway. Opened in 1936 by King Haakon VII, it is Norway's oldest business school and has since its foundation been a leading Norwegian teaching and research institution in the fields of economics and business administration. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011. - International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories. It is the exchange of goods and services among nations of the world. In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP). While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries. - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Jan Ingvald Meidell Haaland ( born February 18 , 1956 ) is the rector of the Norwegian School of Economics ( NHH ) . He succeeded Per Ivar Gjærum in August 2005 . Haaland is also professor of economics . His research has mainly focused on questions related to international trade . After growing up in Stavanger , Haaland was an educated siv.øk . from NHH in 1979 and continued on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy from the same institution in 1984 . In addition to working at NHH he has worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , the University of Cambridge and the University of Southampton . Most of his research is regarding international economics and trade , international politics , economic integration and multinational corporations . He is also an associate of the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London . Between 1999 and 2001 he was Dean of the Department of Economics and since 2002 has been a member of the board of NHH . - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science. - The Amber Road was an ancient trade route for the transfer of amber from coastal areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Prehistoric trade routes between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade. As an important raw material, sometimes dubbed \\"the gold of the north\\", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the Vistula and Dnieper rivers to Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, Syria and Egypt thousands of years ago, and long after. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD.

Ash examined Riley closely after they fell down the flight of stairs. Given the context: What will happen to Ash? Possible answers: call for an ambulance, laugh at Riley because they got hurt, sore from the fall","completion":"After witnessing the incident, Ash will likely initially feel a strong surge of concern for their friend Riley, who just fell down the flight of stairs. Assessing the severity of the situation, Ash must decide on an appropriate course of action to ensure Riley receives the proper care and attention needed in the aftermath of their fall. Ash might determine that Riley's injuries are severe enough to warrant immediate medical assistance. In this case, Ash would be prudent to call for an ambulance without delay, notifying paramedics of the situation and the need for emergency care. Ash would then relay vital information about Riley's condition, allowing the medical team to be prepared and respond accordingly. While waiting for the ambulance, Ash could also attempt to comfort and calm Riley, making sure not to move them unnecessarily in case of possible fractures or other serious injuries. On the other hand, if Ash discovers that Riley's fall wasn't too severe, they might find humor in the situation after realizing Riley is relatively unharmed. It's possible that Ash could laugh at Riley for the mishap, especially if they share a close friendship and sense of humor. Lightening the mood by sharing a laugh in an otherwise tense moment might serve to diffuse the stress of the situation, though Ash should still keep an eye on Riley for any signs of injury or discomfort that could be masked by adrenaline. Depending on Ash's position during Riley's fall, they might also find themselves physically affected by the incident. It's possible that Ash could be left sore and aching from the fall, even if they didn't tumble down the stairs themselves. In this case, Ash would have to contend with their own discomfort and possible injuries while still providing care and support for Riley. They might need to assess their own state and potentially seek medical attention or assistance from another friend, should the need arise. In conclusion, Ash's likely response in this situation would greatly depend on the severity of Riley's injuries and the dynamic of their friendship. The most responsible course of action would entail focusing on the well-being of their friend and seeking immediate help in case of serious injuries, though some humor in less severe circumstances could serve as a tension-reliever. Additionally, Ash must also be attentive to their own well-being, seeking aid as necessary to ensure both of them are safe and cared for in the wake of the fall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The lack of action to tackle liver disease in the UK is \\"scandalous\\" according to a group of MPs.","completion":"Title: The Scandalous Inaction in Tackling Liver Disease in the UK: A Growing Concern for Public Health Introduction: In recent years, liver disease has become an alarming public health issue in the UK, causing thousands of deaths and putting immense pressure on the National Health Service (NHS). Despite the severity of the problem, the lack of concrete action by the government to address this health crisis has been criticized by various stakeholders. A group of MPs has recently described the government's response to tackling liver disease as \\"scandalous.\\" This article highlights the current state of liver disease in the UK, the implications for public health, the reasons behind government inaction, and potential solutions on how to best combat this growing epidemic. The Current State of Liver Disease in the UK: Liver disease in the UK has been steadily increasing, and it is now the fifth-biggest killer. According to The British Liver Trust, 11,575 people died from liver disease in England in 2019 alone. This is a 44% increase over the decade, making it one of the biggest causes of premature mortality. There are several factors that contribute to the rise of liver disease, such as alcohol consumption, obesity, and the hepatitis C virus. If left unaddressed, these factors, along with the increasing liver disease deaths, pose a severe threat to public health. Implications for Public Health and the National Health Service (NHS): Liver disease has significant consequences for both public health and the NHS. The cost of treating liver disease is substantial, with hospitalizations related to alcoholic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, and viral hepatitis collectively costing the NHS £1.2 billion annually. These costs put massive pressure on an already strained healthcare system. Additionally, the prevalence of liver disease and its implications on public health points to an urgent need for preventive measures and effective strategies to raise awareness and encourage healthier lifestyles. Reasons Behind the Government's Inaction: There is no single explanation for the government's apparent indifference to the liver disease crisis. However, possible reasons for their inaction may include a lack of public awareness resulting in limited pressure on political leaders, an unwillingness to tackle long-standing societal issues (such as alcohol consumption and poor dietary habits), and budget constraints within the NHS. Potential Solutions and Recommendations: To combat the liver disease epidemic, a multi-faceted approach involving various stakeholders is necessary. Some recommendations for action include: 1. Raising Awareness: Launching public awareness campaigns about the risks associated with liver disease and its prevention is crucial. These campaigns should focus on reducing alcohol consumption, adopting healthier eating habits, and promoting regular exercise to reduce obesity. 2. Screening Programs: The implementation of nationwide screening programs for at-risk groups, such as heavy drinkers, people with obesity, and those with chronic hepatitis, can help detect liver diseases early and improve treatment outcomes. 3. Policy Changes: The government must introduce new policies to control the sale and consumption of alcohol, such as minimum unit pricing and restrictions on advertising. Furthermore, the promotion of healthier food options and discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods through taxes and regulation can help combat obesity. 4. Improved Access to Treatment: Ensuring that patients with liver disease have access to the necessary medical care is vital. Investment in specialist liver disease services, such as dedicated hepatology wards, transplant units, and specialized nurse practitioners, can improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall healthcare burden. Conclusion: The alarming growth of liver disease in the UK requires an urgent, comprehensive, and multi-sectoral response. Political leaders, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders must work together to address this severe public health crisis. It is essential to remember that the success of these efforts will not only save lives but also reduce the immense pressure faced by an already strained National Health Service."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan listen (5 September 1888 - 17 April 1975) was an Indian philosopher and statesman who was the first Vice President of India (1952-1962) and the second President of India from 1962 to 1967. One of India's most distinguished twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy, his academic appointments included professor of Philosophy at the University of Mysore (1918-1921), the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta (1921-1932) and Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at University of Oxford (1936-1952). His philosophy was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary understanding. In April 1909, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the Madras Presidency College. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore, where he taught at its Maharaja's College, Mysore. By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He also completed his first book, The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore. He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the \\"genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit\\". His second book, The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy was published in 1920. In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the Hibbert Lecture on the ideals of life which he delivered at Harris Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as An Idealist View of Life. In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Harris Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by George V in the June 1931 Birthday Honours, and formally invested with his honour by the Governor-General of India, the Earl of Willingdon, in April 1932. However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence, preferring instead his academic title of 'Doctor'. He was the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not public at the time. Further nominations for the award would continue steadily into the 1960s. In 1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU). He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.

Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. Learning that she has posed for Sordi and become the subject of the latest in the artist's series of \\"Dead Red Nudes,\\" he visits her sister Donna (Sandra Knight) to ask her forgiveness. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off. That night, he later follows her through the streets and murders...

Summarize: Elevating your wrist above the level of your heart will help reduce swelling and pain. It’s important to elevate your wrist for at least the first 48-72 hours after having a cast put on. Your doctor may recommend that you elevate it longer. You may also need to keep the wrist elevated while you sleep or during the day. Try propping it up on a few pillows. Icing your wrist can help reduce swelling and ease your pain. Make sure to keep your cast dry while applying ice. Put ice in a zip-top plastic bag. Make sure the bag is sealed properly to avoid leaks. Wrap the bag in a towel to make sure condensation doesn’t get into your cast. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables as an ice pack. Look for veggies that are small and even in size, such as corn or peas. (And obviously, don’t eat them after you’ve used the bag as an ice-pack.) Hold the ice on your wrist for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Apply ice for the first 2-3 days, or as long as your doctor recommends. You may also find it helpful to use a commercial gel-based ice pack. These are reusable, freezable ice packs that won’t melt and leak water onto a cast. You can find them at medical supply stores and most pharmacies. Most wrist pain can be treated with a non-prescription pain reliever. You should talk with your doctor about what type of painkiller is appropriate for you. Some can interfere with medical conditions or other medications you’re taking. Your doctor may recommend a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen/paracetamol to fight pain and reduce swelling. These are more effective together than either one is alone. Ibuprofen is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). These help reduce fever and swelling by inhibiting your body’s production of prostaglandins. Other NSAIDs include naproxen sodium and aspirin, although aspirin has a more prolonged anti-clotting effect than other NSAIDs. Your doctor may not recommend aspirin if you have a bleeding disorder, asthma, anemia, or other medical condition. Aspirin can cause negative interactions with several medical conditions and medications. When administering pain relievers to a child, be sure to use a children’s formula and follow the dosage for the child’s age and weight. Aspirin is not recommended for children under age 18. There is a risk of liver damage when taking acetaminophen, so use only as much as recommended by your doctor. Do not take an OTC painkiller for more than 10 days (5 days in children) unless directed by your doctor. If your pain persists after 10 days, see your doctor. It’s important to exercise any joints that aren’t under the cast, such as your elbow and fingers, to keep circulation flowing. This will help speed your healing process and increase mobility. If you experience pain when moving your elbow or fingers, contact your doctor. You may find that your skin gets itchy under the cast, and you’ll probably want to scratch it. Don’t! This can cause harm to your skin or the cast. Don’t poke or stick anything into the cast. Try raising your cast or blowing on it with a hairdryer on the “low” or “cool” setting instead. Don’t put powders into the cast, either. Anti-itch powders can cause irritation when they’re trapped under the cast. Your cast may rub or irritate your skin where its edges meet your skin. You can apply moleskin, which is a soft fabric with an adhesive backing, directly to the skin where the cast is rubbing. You can purchase moleskin at drug stores and pharmacies. Apply moleskin to clean, dry skin. Replace it when it gets dirty or loses its stickiness. If the edges of your cast become rough, you can use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges. Don’t peel, cut, or break off pieces of your cast. In most cases, your wrist will heal in a few weeks with proper care. You should call your doctor if you experience any of the following: Numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers Cold, pale or blue fingers Increased pain or swelling of the area after the cast has been put on Raw or irritated skin around the edges of the cast Cracks or soft spots in the cast Wet, loose, or tight casts Casts that smell bad or itching that won’t go away","completion":"To reduce swelling and pain, elevate your wrist above the heart level for at least 48-72 hours after getting a cast.

Consult your doctor for appropriate non-prescription pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, taking care with dosage and duration. Exercise uncasted joints like elbow and fingers for better circulation and healing. Avoid scratching under the cast and instead use a cool hairdryer. For cast irritation, apply moleskin on affected skin and file rough edges with a nail file.

UPDATED:. 03:14 EST, 20 March 2013. £4.8bn move: The Chancellor George Osborne will agree to unlock billions in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous junior ISAs. The savings of more than six million children are to be rescued and the remaining elderly victims of one of Britain’s biggest financial scandals compensated in a twin Budget boost for young and old. Chancellor George Osborne will today agree to unlock £4.8billion in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous Junior ISAs. His move follows a long-running Money Mail campaign. The Chancellor will also use his Budget statement to announce that thousands of elderly people who lost up to half their life savings when Equitable Life came close to collapse a decade ago will receive compensation. Policyholders over the age of 60 who bought annuities from the world’s oldest insurer before September 1 1992, who have previously been excluded from a repayment scheme, will receive up to £10,000 each. The Chancellor’s fourth Budget will be delivered against a grim economic backdrop, with flatlining growth putting his deficit-reduction plans under great strain. He is expected to scrap a planned 3p fuel duty rise due in the autumn, and increase the threshold for income tax to £10,000, benefiting 24million basic rate taxpayers. Treasury sources told the Daily Mail that one key move to boost savings will be an announcement that funds will be allowed to be transferred from child trust funds to Junior ISAs. Many parents and grandparents have contributed thousands of pounds to child trust funds on the back of promises from the last Government that they would prove ideal long-term investments for their child. But Coalition austerity measures meant the £250 being paid to every newborn to start a fund was stopped and the trust funds scrapped, to be replaced by Junior ISAs with no state contribution. Pressure: The Chancellor's move to rescue the savings of more than six million children follows a long-running campaign by Money Mail. Those with a child trust fund – children born between September 1, 2002, and January 2, 2011 – have not been entitled to open a Junior ISA or transfer their cash to one. But there have been growing concerns that the £4.8billion in the funds could be condemned to years of poor returns. Experts have warned that investment firms no longer able to attract new customers have little incentive to put their best managers in charge, while banks and building societies have paid derisory interest rates. Crucially, the rates paid on Junior ISAs are much better, and there are thousands of funds to choose from. Mr Osborne will announce a 12-week consultation on how to allow transfers of funds from child trust fund accounts into Junior ISAs. These transfers could be voluntary or mandatory. The Chancellor will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders – the subject of another Daily Mail campaign. Up to a million victims lost out when Equitable Life closed to new business. Victims: Mr Osborne will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders who lost money when the firm collapsed in 2000. The Government was obliged to pay compensation to some policyholders following a series of scathing judgements. Parliamentary ombudsman Ann Abraham concluded there were ten instances of maladministration between 1998 and 2001 at the Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Actuary Department and the Financial Services Authority, which contributed to the firm’s collapse. Currently, policyholders who bought a with-profits annuity from Equitable Life before September 1, 1992 are not included in a compensation scheme announced in 2010. Campaigners have asked that a specific group of 9,000 elderly policyholders should be included. Now, those over the age of 60 will get £5,000, with an additional £5,000 for those in receipt of Pension Credit. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article talks about the following important points: 1.

The user appears to be frustrated and upset, as shown through their use of words and phrases like \\"Nooo,\\" \\"timed out,\\" \\"don't wanna wait,\\" and \\"*flails*\\" which all indicate dissatisfaction and disappointment. The situation described in the tweet, which involves Megavideo timing out and the user being unable to watch their desired content for a significant amount of time (48 minutes), further supports the negative sentiment prediction. The inability to continue watching after only 18 minutes is causing the user distress, and their emotional reaction is evident in their words. Moreover, the use of the term \\"flails\\" is a strong indication of distress and frustration. It is often used to describe a physical action of flailing one's limbs, generally in response to an intense emotional state such as anger, panic, or despair, which further confirms the negative sentiment of the tweet.

Asoka is a child when his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, decides to renounce the throne to become a Jainist monk. Before his departure, Asoka's grandfather finds out that Asoka stole his sword and he confronts him. Chandragupta tells Asoka that his sword is cursed to taste blood whenever it is drawn, and he throws it into a creek. After he leaves, Asoka finds the sword and keeps it. The throne goes to Asoka's father, Bindusara, and the movie skips to Asokas adulthood. Bindusara is about to renounce the throne to his successor. He names his son Susima, who has the support of all his brothers except Asoka. When the movie picks up, Asoka is leading his troops in battle against the Takshila army, who have an advantage in numbers. Asoka prevails and kills the leader of the Takshilas. He comes home alive and unharmed, which angers Susima. Susima had ordered General Shivrath to make Asoka conquer Takshila with half an army, expecting Asoka to die in the struggle. Susima orders Shivrath dead and hires an assassin to kill Asoka while he is bathing. Asoka kills the assassin with ease and goes to visit his mother. His mother expresses concern and tells Asoka to leave the city, threatening to take a vow of silence if he does not. Not wanting his mother to never speak to anyone again, Asoka reluctantly leaves. Asoka wanders around, going under the name Pawan, and encounters a beautiful woman. He is immediately stricken with love, and he follows her. After hearing a request for the capture of Princess Kaurwaki and Prince Arya of Kalinga, Asoka saves the woman from attackers who wanted to collect the reward. He discovers that the woman is Princess Kaurwaki and she is escaping from the capital after the prime minister assassinated their parents.

Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store. P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones.

Helen Folasade Adu was born on 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Her middle name, Folasade, means \\"honour confers a crown\\". Her parents, Adebisi Adu, a Nigerian lecturer in economics of Yoruba background, and Anne Hayes, an English district nurse, met in London, married in 1955 and moved to Nigeria. Her parents separated, however, and Anne Hayes returned to England, taking four-year-old Sade and older brother Banji with her to live with their grandparents near Colchester, Essex. After completing a three-year course work in fashion design, and later modeling briefly, Sade began backup singing with British band Pride. During this time, she formed a songwriting partnership with Pride's guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman; together, backed by Pride's rhythm section, they began doing their own sets at Pride gigs. Her solo performances of the song \\"Smooth Operator\\" attracted the attention of record companies, and in 1983 Sade and Matthewman split from Pride, along with keyboardist Andrew Hale, bassist Paul Denman and drummer Paul Cook, to form the band Sade. By the time she performed her first show at London's Heaven nightclub, she had become so popular that 1,000 people were turned away at the door. In May 1983, Sade performed their first US show at the Danceteria nightclub in New York City. On 18 October 1983, Sade Adu signed with Epic Records, while the rest of the band signed in 1984. Following the record deal, the group began recording their debut album, Diamond Life, which took six weeks to record and was recorded entirely at The Power Plant in London. Diamond Life was released on 16 July 1984, reached number two in the UK Album Chart, sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK, and won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 1985. The album was also a hit internationally, reaching number one in several countries and the top ten in the US, where it has sold in excess of four million copies. Diamond Life had international sales of over six million copies, becoming one of the top-selling debut recordings of the '80s, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. \\"Your Love Is King\\" was released as the album's lead single on 25 February 1984 and was a success in European territories, charting at number seven in Ireland and number six on the UK Singles Chart. The song was less successful in the US, where it peaked at number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The third single, \\"Smooth Operator\\", was released on 15 September 1984 and became the most successful song in the US from the album Diamond Life. The track peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the US Billboard Hot Black Singles, as well as peaking at number one on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In Europe the song fared well, peaking at number 19 in the UK, and reaching the top 20 in Austria, Switzerland, France and Germany.

Answer the following question: - You fill the tray with warm water - You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water - The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid - The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid - Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process of making clear ice cubes is to fill the tray with warm water. Using warm water is beneficial because it allows gases in the water to evaporate, resulting in clearer ice cubes without cracks from trapped gases. This step is crucial for the following reasons: 1. Warm water ensures clearer ice cubes: When warm water freezes, the gases that might otherwise be trapped inside the ice are able to escape more easily. This is due to the increased rate of dissolving of these gases in warmer water. As the water cools down, the solubility of the gases decreases, allowing them to be released as the water temperature drops. The resulting ice cubes are much clearer and free of cracks that can be caused by trapped gases. 2. Facilitates even freezing: Filling the tray with warm water ensures that the water is evenly distributed across the entire ice cube tray. This allows the water in each compartment of the tray to freeze uniformly, contributing to the overall clarity of the ice cubes. 3. Reduces the risk of cloudy ice cubes: Cloudy ice cubes often occur due to the impurities and trapped air bubbles in the water. Using warm water helps eliminate these air bubbles, resulting in clearer and more attractive ice cubes. 4. Enhanced cooling efficiency: Warm water circulates better than cold water due to its lower viscosity. This ensures that the water in the tray is cooled uniformly and efficiently. This also contributes to the clarity of the finished ice cubes. In summary, the first step of the process of making clear ice cubes is filling the tray with warm water. This step ensures that gases are released, facilitating even freezing and reducing the risk of cloudy ice cubes. It also contributes to more efficient cooling and the overall quality of the ice cubes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Cameron played soccer with some friends outside because it was so nice. Given the context: What else will they do? Possible answers: go inside because of the rain, enjoy the sunshine, get the winning goal","completion":"Based on the context provided, it appears that the weather was nice which facilitated Cameron and his friends to play soccer outside. Bearing this information in mind, the most probable scenario of what else they might do shifts towards activities that align with good weather conditions. Here are a few extrapolations: 1. Enjoy the Sunshine: Since the weather is established as being nice, it is quite likely that Cameron and his friends will continue to enjoy the sunshine after playing soccer. They could involve themselves in other outdoor activities - this could range from simply relaxing and catching some sun, having a picnic, or playing other outdoor games. Given that the sun is out and the weather amicable, they could also engage in activities like frisbee, cycling, or even going for a run. The presence of the sun hints at a warm day, perfect to maybe twist open a can of soda, ignite a barbecue, or indulge in some outdoor lunch. 2. Get the Winning Goal: It's mentioned that Cameron and his friends are playing soccer. Therefore, a possible follow-up activity could mean striving to get the winning goal. Soccer games usually infuse competitive spirits within the players, and the idea of shooting the winning goal always holds an appealing aspect. They may continue playing until someone finally scores the final, decisive goal, leading their team to victory. This will not only spike their competitive fervour but also extend the enjoyment of their time outdoors. 3. Gather for Refreshments: Post their friendly soccer match, a common activity could be gathering around for cool refreshments to rejuvenate themselves. This could be a post-match meet-up where they could talk about the highlights of their play, have fun and bond over the shared experience. The scenario of retreating indoors due to rain seems less plausible given that the weather is described as \\"nice.\\" There is no indication of a possible change of weather from the context provided. Hence, the likelihood of them going inside because of rain is quite minimal based on the information currently provided. Based on probabilities, it seems like Cameron and his friends are set to make the most out of the beautiful day, indulging in various outdoor activities and games or simply absorbing the cheerful vibe of a sunny day with friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the grandfather paradox because it is a historical fact that your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived.

A: You know how to read 5 pieces of pizza - This option partly acknowledges that pizza can be read, which is not true, and it adds an arbitrary quantity (5 pieces) that is irrelevant to the statement's impracticality. B: Pizzas are not readable - This option states the fact that pizzas cannot be read, which directly addresses the impracticality of the original statement. C: You can read a book, but pizzas don't run - This option compares reading to running, which is a confusing comparison. It might imply that pizzas don't provide a narrative that can be read like a book, but it doesn't directly address the issue of reading a pizza. After analyzing each option, I choose B: Pizzas are not readable as the most corresponding reason explaining why the statement \\"I want to read that pizza\\" doesn't make sense.

Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles more? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, Usain will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more than Asafa. The reasoning behind this conclusion is rooted in the fact that Usain transitioned from being a competitive swimmer to running very frequently. Both swimming and running are forms of aerobic exercise, which has a direct positive impact on the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles. Aerobic exercises, like swimming and running, help to strengthen the heart by increasing the heart's capacity to pump blood and transport oxygen throughout the body. This, in turn, improves the overall cardiovascular endurance and heart health. On the other hand, Asafa is not inclined towards running, which implies that he does not engage in it as much as Usain. Since Asafa hardly runs at all, he is not providing his cardiac muscles with the same level of aerobic exertion that Usain does, and therefore, he is not building his cardiac strength to the same extent. In conclusion, Usain's transition from competitive swimming to frequent running would lead to a higher rate of cardiac muscle strengthening when compared to Asafa, who does not indulge in running or aerobic exercise as often. This makes Usain the one who will significantly increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more than Asafa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Decoupling illustrated by environmental impacts for 4 factors (greenhouse gases, runoffs of nutrients into the sea, emissions of acidifying compounds and emissions to air) in relation to GDP Make this lower case.","completion":"Decoupling can be defined as the separation of economic growth from the negative effects it has on the environment. This concept has gained significant attention in the last few decades, as it presents a solution to achieving sustainable development without slowing down the growth of economies. To provide a detailed and long explanation, let's examine decoupling through the lens of four environmental factors: greenhouse gases, runoffs of nutrients into the sea, emissions of acidifying compounds, and emissions to air, thereby connecting them to GDP. 1. Greenhouse Gases and GDP. Greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are major contributors to global warming and climate change. They result primarily from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activities. Economic growth has traditionally been dependent on the consumption of abundant fossil fuels, which come with a high environmental cost. Decoupling seeks to break this connection by promoting alternative sources of energy, efficiency improvements, and structural changes in industries. In some countries, a relative decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions from GDP growth has been observed. This means that emissions continue to grow, but at a slower pace than GDP. For example, a country may be adopting renewable energy sources or improving energy efficiency. So, even though the economy is growing, greenhouse gas emissions are not growing proportionally. However, absolute decoupling, i.e., decreasing emissions while the economy grows, is more challenging and is the ultimate aim. 2. Runoffs of Nutrients into the Sea and GDP. Runoff of nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) into the sea, has detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems and water quality. Sources of nutrient pollution include agricultural practices, sewage and wastewater discharge, and industrial emissions. High GDP growth often entails an increase in agricultural production, leading to more use of fertilizers and higher runoffs, impacting marine ecosystems and disrupting the balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability. Decoupling in this context involves finding the balance between economic growth and controlling nutrient pollution. This can be achieved through practices such as precision agriculture that optimizes nutrient application, advanced wastewater treatment systems, and minimizing nutrient losses from industry. By promoting these methods and preventing an increase in runoff as GDP grows, we can achieve a relative, or eventually, an absolute decoupling of nutrient runoffs from GDP growth. 3. Emissions of Acidifying Compounds and GDP. Emissions of acidifying compounds, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia (NH3), result from various industrial, agricultural, and transportation activities. High emissions contribute to acid rain, which negatively affects soil, water systems, buildings, and cultural heritage sites. Acidifying emissions are often linked to GDP growth, as greater economic activities imply an increase in power generation from fossil fuels, transportation, and industrial processes. Decoupling these emissions from GDP growth can be achieved by employing cleaner technologies in industries and transportation, transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, and promoting energy efficiency. Countries or regions that successfully implement these measures can experience a decrease in acidifying emissions while maintaining economic growth, resulting in a relative or absolute decoupling effect. 4. Emissions to Air and GDP. Emissions to air include harmful air pollutants that affect human health, such as particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). As GDP grows, increased consumption of goods and services tends to result in higher emission rates of these pollutants due to industrial production, transportation, and power generation. To achieve decoupling of air pollutant emissions from GDP, it is crucial to adopt cleaner production processes, invest in cleaner energy sources, and implement air pollution control measures. By focusing on these steps, the levels of pollutants may decrease despite increasing GDP, leading to an improved overall quality of life and fostering sustainable development. In conclusion, decoupling environmental impacts from GDP growth is a pivotal aim to ensure sustainable development. By investing in cleaner technologies, alternative energy sources, and stricter regulations, it is possible to minimize the harmful effects associated with greenhouse gases, nutrient runoffs, acidifying compounds, and air pollutant emissions, while still achieving economic growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who had the largest army during the battle? Context: By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice.

Finnish belongs to the Uralic family of languages and it is primarily spoken in Finland where it is one of the two official languages - the other being Swedish. It is also recognized as a minority language in Sweden. Finnish is known for its complex grammatical structures. One of the most distinctive features of Finnish is its extensive use of vowel harmony, which restricts the co-occurrence of vowels in a word to ones from certain harmonic \\"classes\\". Finnish also has an extensive case system for nouns. Nouns and pronouns in Finnish decline in fifteen cases, although rarely all are used in spoken language. The language’s vocabulary has a high level of borrowings from Russian, Swedish, and German. However, the core vocabulary is of Uralic origin. Finnish has also gained a fair amount of international recognition and popularity through the works of Finland’s national author, Aleksis Kivi, and composer Jean Sibelius, who have used the language in their works. Additionally, many fans of the genre of heavy metal might recognize Finnish as the language used by many popular bands from Finland. Finnish language education has been made available in various institutions worldwide due to the interest in the language and culture. In Finland, the language is taught from primary school to university level, and it is also possible to study Finnish language and culture in several universities abroad. Its writing uses the Latin script and the alphabet includes the extra letters ä and ö.

This app is a complete failure and doesn't remotely live up to my expectations, which is why I give it a 1-star rating. First and foremost, the installation process was a hassle. It took multiple attempts to finally get the app downloaded and installed. Once it was installed, the app was incredibly slow, causing a significant lag on my phone. My phone's performance was adversely affected, with an apparent increase in battery drain and frequent app crashes. The UI is confusing and not well-designed, making it difficult to navigate and understand the basic functionalities. I also encountered numerous issues with the app's responsiveness - it would often take multiple taps to register selections, and there were even times when the app would completely freeze on my screen. Also, the app's main purpose - displaying notifications on the lock screen - failed miserably. Notifications would either not be displayed at all or appear inconsistently and in a disorganized manner. The app had a tough time syncing with my other applications, which resulted in missed or delayed notifications. Whenever I reached out to customer support for help, the responses were unhelpful and dismissive. It felt like they didn't really care about the users and their overall experience with the app. Their lack of support, along with the various issues I encountered, led me to uninstall com.achep.acdisplay completely. In conclusion, I would strongly discourage anyone from downloading and using this app. It severely impacted my phone's performance and the overall user experience, resulting in nothing but frustration and disappointment.

Answer based on context: Coming off their AFC West division-clinching win over the Chargers, the Broncos traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday Night Football. The Broncos grabbed the early lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Bengals' cornerback Andy Dalton 33 yards for a touchdown. However, on the first play of the Bengals' third possession, running back Jeremy Hill reeled off an 85-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The Bengals claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. On the Broncos' next possession, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Bengals' safety Reggie Nelson, and the Bengals capitalized, with Dalton connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jermaine Gresham. A 49-yard field goal by Nugent with one minute remaining in the first half increased the Bengals' lead to 20-7. The Broncos had one last possession before halftime, however, placekicker Connor Barth missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt. On the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, return specialist Omar Bolden returned the opening kickoff to the Bengals' 21-yard line. Four plays later, running back C. J. Anderson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. However, the Bengals had a response, as Adam Jones advanced the ensuing kickoff to the Broncos' 27-yard line. Three plays later, Dalton threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Giovani Bernard. The Broncos then scored 14 unanswered points, with Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders &#8212; from 4 and 5 yards out &#8212; to give the Broncos a 28-27 lead. The second scoring play came after Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a fumble off Hill just as the Bengals were attempting to add to their lead. Rain started to fall in the fourth quarter, and on the Broncos' first fourth quarter possession, Manning was intercepted by Jones deep in Broncos' territory, however, a 15-yard taunting penalty on Nelson pushed the Bengals out of field goal range. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next possession, and return specialist Brandon Tate advanced all the way to the Broncos' 9-yard line. The Broncos defense forced the Bengals to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Nugent to give the Bengals a 30-28 lead with 7:53 remaining in the game. The two teams traded punts on their next possessions, and the Broncos attempted a rally, however, Bengals' cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick returned an interception off Manning 30 yards for a touchdown. With the rain intensifying, the Broncos had one last possession, but Manning threw another interception to Kirkpatrick, this one deep in Bengals' territory &#8212; Manning's fourth interception of the game &#8212; to seal the victory for the Bengals. This was Peyton Manning's first loss to the Bengals in nine career games.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true, as they both convey the same fundamental idea. The premise and hypothesis both convey the belief that countries we have helped would eventually pay us back, but that expectation has not been met. To better understand the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, let us first dissect them: Premise: \\"somehow we still i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were eventually going to pay us back and that hasn't happened\\" This statement describes a belief that the countries we have helped would eventually pay us back. It acknowledges some uncertainty (i.e., \\"somehow,\\" \\"I guess\\") but maintains that this belief has existed. It then concludes by mentioning that this has not occurred, suggesting that the expectation of repayment has not been fulfilled. Hypothesis: \\"We believed that the countries we helped would eventually pay us back, but that hasn't happened.\\" This statement is essentially a distilled version of the premise. It asserts the same belief that the countries receiving help would pay us back eventually, and it also states that this has not happened. Comparing the two statements, it becomes clear that they share the same fundamental idea. The premise is a more loosely structured sentence, while the hypothesis is a more focused and concise statement. Nevertheless, both essentially convey that there was a belief in eventual repayment that has remained unfulfilled. In conclusion, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis can be considered true as well, as they share the same core concept. The premise acknowledges the existence of a belief that countries receiving help would eventually repay, and it asserts that this has not happened. The hypothesis succinctly captures this same idea, so if the premise is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis would also be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Search for your question: Before posting a new question, make sure you search for your question using the search bar at the top of the page. Quora might already have an answer to your question, or a similar question might have been asked before. 3. Post a new question: If you cannot find an answer to your question, click on the \\"Add Question\\" button located in the top-right corner on desktop or tap on the \\"+\\" button on mobile devices. A dialogue box will appear prompting you to type your question. 4. Write your question: Frame your question using clear and concise language so that others can understand it easily. Try to be specific and avoid ambiguous wording. 5. Add relevant topics: After writing your question, add relevant topics by typing keywords related to your question in the \\"Add topics\\" field. This will make your question appear in feeds of people who follow those topics and improve its visibility. 6. Review and submit your question: After adding topics, review your question once more, and click on the \\"Add Question\\" button to submit it. Once your question is posted, others in the Quora community will be able to respond with their answers and opinions. Question 2: How many topics can you add to a question on Quora? When you post a question on Quora, the platform allows you to add multiple topics, which help categorize the question and make it more visible to users who are interested in those specific topics. There is, however, a limit to the number of topics you can add. Currently, Quora allows you to add up to 5 topics to a single question. To add topics to your question, follow these steps: 1. Write your question: After clicking on the \\"Add Question\\" button or the \\"+\\" button, type in your question in the dialogue box. 2. Add topics: In the \\"Add topics\\" field, start typing keywords related to your question. As you type, a list of suggested topics will appear below. You can either select one of the suggested topics or continue typing to add a custom topic. 3. Repeat for additional topics: Continue adding topics related to your question, up to a maximum of 5. Remember that adding relevant topics increases the visibility of your question to users who follow those topics. 4. Submit your question: Once you've added the desired topics, review your question, and click on the \\"Add Question\\" button to submit it to the Quora community. By providing two separate answers, it is clear that the information sought in each question is different. The first question requires an explanation of the steps for posting a question, while the second question is about the maximum number of topics one can add to a question on Quora."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tweet: i dont know what to do!!!1 can someone help me please Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"To predict the sentiment of a tweet, it is essential to analyze the language used, the context, and any emojis or punctuation that may convey additional emotion. In this case, the tweet reads: \\"i dont know what to do!!!1 can someone help me please\\" First, let's break down the tweet into key elements: 1. \\"i dont know what to do\\": This statement is an expression of uncertainty or confusion, implying that the individual is feeling lost or unsure about what course of action to take. These emotions typically convey a negative sentiment. 2. \\"!!!1\\": The exclamation marks demonstrate a sense of urgency, further emphasizing the negative emotion and distress expressed in the tweet. The inclusion of a \\"1\\" is likely a typo but does little to impact the overall tone. 3. \\"can someone help me please\\": This part of the tweet suggests that the individual is seeking support or assistance from others. The inclusion of the word \\"please\\" demonstrates politeness and a strong desire for help. Overall, this part of the tweet conveys a sense of vulnerability and desperation, which is also indicative of a negative sentiment. Taking all of these elements into consideration, the sentiment of this tweet appears to be negative. The individual is expressing their confusion, uncertainty, and the need for help in a manner that also communicates a sense of urgency and distress. Although the tweet does not explicitly state any emotions such as sadness, anger, or fear, the language used and context suggest that the individual is experiencing negative emotions, and the tweet conveys these emotions to its audience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

Which student read more about animals carrying out lactic acid fermentation? Hint: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Thomas is a research assistant and has taken samples of rat liver enzymes that need to be stored overnight. He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top. Which sample will be viable for longer, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The sample that will be viable for longer is the one placed in refrigerated storage. Temperature plays a critical role in the stability and functionality of enzymes, which are proteins that act as catalysts to facilitate various biochemical reactions. Enzymes have an optimal temperature at which they perform most efficiently, and as the temperature deviates from this optimum, their activity may decrease. When the temperature is too high, enzymes can become denatured, losing their structure and function. Conversely, when the temperature is too low, enzyme activity slows down, but it typically does not result in denaturation. In the case of Thomas, the research assistant, he has placed one sample of rat liver enzymes in refrigerated storage and left another out on the countertop. The refrigerated storage helps maintain a cooler and more stable environment for the enzymes, preserving the sample's structure and preventing denaturation. On the other hand, the sample left on the countertop is exposed to higher temperatures and potential temperature fluctuations. As a result, there is a higher risk of the enzymes losing their function and becoming denatured. Therefore, the rat liver enzyme sample placed in refrigerated storage will be viable for a longer time compared to the one left on the countertop. It is crucial to store enzyme samples and other temperature-sensitive materials under appropriate conditions to ensure their stability and functionality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lord Robert Cecil was born at Hatfield House, the second son of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury and Frances Mary Gascoyne. He was a patrilineal descendant of Lord Burghley and the 1st Earl of Salisbury, chief ministers of Elizabeth I. The family owned vast rural estates in Hertfordshire and Dorset. This wealth increased sharply in 1821, when he married the rich heiress of a merchant prince who had bought up large estates in Essex and Lancashire. Robert had a miserable childhood, with few friends; he filled his time with reading. He was bullied unmercifully at the schools he attended. In 1840, he went to Eton College, where he did well in French, German, Classics, and Theology; however, he left in 1845 because of intense bullying. The unhappy schooling shaped his pessimistic outlook on life and his negative views on democracy. He decided that most people were cowardly and cruel, and that the mob would run roughshod over sensitive individuals. In December 1847 he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he received an honorary fourth class in mathematics conferred by nobleman's privilege due to ill health. Whilst at Oxford he found the Oxford movement or \\"Tractarianism\\" to be an intoxicating force; he had an intense religious experience that shaped his life. In April 1850 he joined Lincoln's Inn but subsequently did not enjoy law. His doctor advised him to travel for his health, and so in July 1851 to May 1853 Cecil travelled through Cape Colony, Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand. He disliked the Boers and wrote that free institutions and self-government could not be granted to the Cape Colony because the Boers outnumbered the British three-to-one, and \\"it will simply be delivering us over bound hand and foot into the power of the Dutch, who hate us as much as a conquered people can hate their conquerors\\". He found the Kaffirs \\"a fine set of men - whose language bears traces of a very high former civilisation\\", similar to Italian. They were \\"an intellectual race, with great firmness and fixedness of will\\" but \\"horribly immoral\\" as they lacked theism. In the Bendigo goldmine of Australia, he claimed that \\"there is not half as much crime or insubordination as there would be in an English town of the same wealth and population\\". Ten thousand miners were policed by four men armed with carbines, and at Mount Alexander 30,000 people were protected by 200 policemen, with over 30,000 ounces of gold mined per week. He believed that there was \\"generally far more civility than I should be likely to find in the good town of Hatfield\\" and claimed this was due to \\"the government was that of the Queen, not of the mob; from above, not from below. Holding from a supposed right (whether real or not, no matter)\\" and from \\"the People the source of all legitimate power,\\" Cecil said of the Maori of New Zealand: \\"The natives seem when they have converted to make much better Christians than the white man\\".

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: What does the man make his children do now that he is grown?

Riddick is captured by the mercs and flown to the same unsavoury and possibly illegal prison Kyra is in. Turns out Jack is now known as Kyra (Alexa Davalos) and is tough as nails. The mercs and the prison guards can't agree on the bounty to be paid for Riddick. When the guards learn that a Necro ship has followed the mercs to the planet, tension boils over and the guards and mercs shoot it out. Following the battle, Riddick, Kyra, and the other prisoners escape. They realize the guards have deserted them and are attempting to escape the Necros; they head out across the surface of Crematoria hoping to beat the guards to the escape ship. Meanwhile, the Necro Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) speaks with Aerion (Dame Judi Dench), an air Elemental capable of seeing into the future in some limited way but now imprisoned by the Necros. Aerion reveals that The Lord Marshal previously tried to exterminate the race of Furians because of a prophecy which foretold he would be killed by one. Riddick is a Furian. Back on Crematoria, Riddick and his fellow escapees race across the ravaged surface to stay ahead of the sunrise, as the surface termperature of the planet increases to 700F in full daylight, and fight the surviving prison guards on the way. They reach the escape ship only to find Necros and guards already there. A three-way battle ensues between the Necros, the convicts, and the guards; the guards are all killed, Kyra taken prisoner, and Riddick left for dead by Necro Commander Vaako. He is rescued from the sunlight by a Necro who was born a Furian like Riddick, who gives him a message from the Lord Marshal (in case he survived the attack): he will no longer be hunted so long as he stays away from Helion. The ex-Furian gives Riddick a Furian knife, then kills himself. Naturally, Riddick heads to Helion to take on the Lord Marshal and find Kyra. Believing Riddick dead, the Lord Marshal promotes Vaako to first among Commanders. The scheming Dame Vaako realizes Riddick is on Helion, and plots with Vaako to let Riddick attack the Lord Marshal and, if he is at all successful, finish him off and sieze power themselves. Aerion reveals to the Lord Marshal that Riddick is in all probability still alive. Riddick attacks the Lord Marshal. The Lord Marshal tells Riddick to join him, and reveals that Kyra has been turned to a Necro. Riddick fights him instead, and is nearly killed before Kyra - apparently not all Necro yet - spears the Lord Marshal in the back. The Lord Marshal returns the favour and impales her on a spike jutting from the wall. Seeing the opportunity, Vaako grabs an axe and swoops in to finish off the Lord Marshal, but Riddick kills him first with the Furian knife. Kyra, dying, tells Riddick she was always with him. Riddick collapses on the Necro throne, and they all bow to him, their new leader., Question: How did Kyra die?","completion":"Kyra died after being impaled on a spike by the Lord Marshal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: good wheel for the money Review: Bought these wheels to compare to my Sector9 65mm 78a Top Shelf wheels to put on my old school skateboard for general cruising and bombing light hills. Wheels look great and have that classic 70's look. Just got the wheels yesterday, received them very fast. Extremely smooth ride as expected on some very rough roads. Makes pushing much easier. Have not had time for a high speed run but have bombed a very small hill. Wheels seems a lot more stable then the S9's. I have not had any speed wobles yet or make my trucks(Indy 169s) go crazy like the S9's. A little disappointed in the speed of these wheels, my S9 seem faster. I am using Bones Red China Bearings. Maybe these wheels will get faster after breaking in. Either then that, great wheel, would recommend for beginner longboarding,cruising, or light downhill. LATER!!!!!!!! Is the review positive or negative?","completion":"The review is mostly positive. The reviewer praises the wheels for their classic look, smooth ride on rough roads, stability, and recommends them for beginner longboarding, cruising or light downhill. However, the reviewer does express some disappointment in the wheel's speed compared to their other set of wheels.

In November, economists swooned with praise when a Communist Party plenum unleashed a torrent of reform pledges, promising everything from easing the one-child policy to liberalizing capital flows to opening protected markets. Now, as we head into yet another major leadership confab, the National People’s Congress (NPC), which starts Mar. 5, everyone is waiting to see if President Xi Jinping and his team will offer any signs on how they intend to turn those pledges into real policy. As HSBC economists said in a recent note to investors: “All eyes will be on whether the authorities will walk the walk of reform after the talk.” Many China watchers remain bullish that real change is afoot. Economist Jun Ma at Deutsche Bank after calling Xi’s announced reforms “unprecedented” in a recent report, went on to comment that “the leadership is fully committed to forcefully implementing these reforms.” The optimists were encouraged by a February meeting of the Central Leading Group for Overall Reform, formed to oversee the economic policy agenda, where Xi emphasized that “the starting of a race decides the second half of the race, and implementation is the key.” A report from BofA-Merrill Lynch listed out a long series of policies the investment bank expected to be discussed at the NPC, including steps to help local governments handle their excessive debt burden, expand more private ownership of state enterprises and strengthen the feeble pension system. Yet at the same time, there is a widespread feeling that China’s leaders are doing a lot more talking about reform than reforming. Initiatives are being rolled out at a glacial pace; some important experiments, in financial liberalization for instance, are being confined only to a free-trade zone in Shanghai. Though the overall reform plan at last November plenum was bolder than many had expected, it was, at the same time, an outgrowth of the direction China has been following for years. Some of the proposed changes were long overdue (loosening the one-child policy) or have been repeated again and again (freeing up the currency) or were just plain vague (handing the private sector more power). Timetables were nowhere to be found. Beijing has good reasons to go slow. There are dangers in pressing forward too rapidly. Throwing open the unprepared financial sector to the world too quickly would be potentially destabilizing. The history of China’s reform process shows that the leadership usually moves in baby steps and mini-experiments, which eventually add up over time to major change. What China has to do is not simple: Shift the world’s second-largest economy from a state-controlled, investment-led growth model to a private-led, consumption-heavy model. It can’t and won’t happen overnight. My argument, though, is that China is just not making enough progress. The steps being taken are tweaking the existing economic system, not altering it in the fundamental ways that have become necessary. State-owned enterprises, bloated and inefficient, won’t become stronger as long as the government coddles, subsidizes and protects them from competition, for instance. The banks won’t allocate money more wisely – away from state-linked firms and projects and towards the more productive private sector – as long as the financial sector remains wrapped in government controls. But the reforms that would address these issues are crawling along. Despite expectations of change, interest rates are still highly regulated in ways that punish savers and favor investment. Since capital isn’t priced properly, consumption suffers while debt escalates. The longer these problems are allowed to fester, the more new problems will arise. That’s what happened with China’s shaky “shadow banking” sector, seen by many as a potential risk to the nation’s economic stability. Credit from trusts and other forms of alternative lending have exploded because companies and investors are trying to circumvent the overly fettered formal banking sector. Caution is necessary but promises alone won’t ensure China’s growth miracle continues. Many economists expect China’s economy to continue to slow down this year as its current growth model sputters. I’d like to see China’s leaders start reshaping the structure of the economy in ways that will unleash its future potential, instead of just promising to do so. Baby steps are fine, but eventually the baby has to learn to walk on its own. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"In this news article, the author talks about China's need for real economic reform. The most important parts are: 1. China's leaders have been promising many reforms, like changing the one-child policy and opening up markets, but people are waiting to see if they will actually make these changes. 2. Some people think that President Xi Jinping and the Chinese government will make these reforms happen, but others think they are just talking about it and not actually doing anything. 3. The article says that China needs to change its economy from being controlled by the government to being more focused on private businesses and people buying things. This will help the economy grow and be stronger. 4. The author thinks that China is not making enough progress in its economic reforms. They believe that the Chinese government needs to change how it controls businesses and banks to help the economy grow. In simple terms, the article is about how China's leaders are promising to make big changes to improve the country's economy, but some people think they are not doing enough to make these changes happen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The type of whisky that shares the same name as a French royal family is the Bourbon whiskey. Bourbon is a type of American whiskey primarily made from corn and aged in new charred oak barrels. It derives its name from the House of Bourbon, which was a French royal family with a significant influence on European history. The House of Bourbon has its origins in France, dating back to the early 13th century, and its members have held various European thrones, including France, Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma. The connection between Bourbon whiskey and the French royal family started with the Bourbon County in Kentucky, where this style of whiskey was first produced in the late-18th-century. During the American Revolutionary War, the region was named in honor of the House of Bourbon, particularly King Louis XVI of France who provided crucial support to the American colonies in their fight for independence against the British. Bourbon County was part of the newly-formed state of Kentucky, which was renowned for its fertile soil, limestone-filtered water, and favorable climate for corn cultivation. These factors, along with the innovative techniques used by early distillers, contributed to the development of the distinct flavor and characteristics of Bourbon whiskey. Some of these distinctive traits include the rich, amber color derived from the charred oak barrels and the warm, sweet flavors with notes of caramel, vanilla, and toasted oak. The production of Bourbon whiskey is regulated by strict standards and laws to ensure its quality and authenticity. These legal requirements include: 1. The mash bill must be made of at least 51% corn, along with other grains such as rye, wheat, or malted barley. 2. Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels, which impart the unique color and flavor profile. 3. Distillation must not exceed 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume), and it must be stored in barrels at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume). 4. Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume). 5. No additives, such as coloring or flavoring, can be introduced during the production process. While Bourbon whiskey is primarily associated with Kentucky due to its historical origins and the large number of distilleries in the state, it can be produced anywhere in the United States, as long as it adheres to the aforementioned legal requirements. In conclusion, Bourbon whiskey shares its name with the French royal family, the House of Bourbon, as a result of the historical connection between Bourbon County in Kentucky and the support provided by King Louis XVI during the American Revolutionary War. It has since evolved into a unique and popular spirit, celebrated for its rich flavors and distinct attributes that set it apart from other types of whiskey."},{"prompt":"Title: Moving back to Frontline....

First, we have 3 terms with 'x' in them: 226x, 267x, and -429x. Let's put the 'x' terms together. Imagine having 226 apples, adding 267 apples, and then taking away 429 apples. So, (226 + 267 – 429) x = 1216. Let's find the total number of apples (x): (493 - 429) x = 1216 64x = 1216 2. Now we need to find out how many times 64 (apples) fit into 1216 (apples) to get the value of x. To do that, we simply divide 1216 by 64: 1216 ÷ 64 = x x = 19 So x is 19! That means 226 times 19, plus 267 times 19, minus 429 times 19 equals 1216. And we solved the puzzle! Great job!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: Bill Clinton refused to watch the episode","completion":"Based on the provided context, it is not possible to draw the hypothesis that Bill Clinton refused to watch the episode. The context refers to the Whitewater controversy as a political episode, meaning a series of events and investigations, rather than an actual recorded televised episode or series. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be supported by the information given. The Whitewater controversy refers to an investigation surrounding the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton, alongside their associates Jim McDougal and Susan McDougal, in the Whitewater Development Corporation. This venture started in the 1970s and 1980s and eventually failed. The context does not mention anything regarding Bill Clinton's engagement or disengagement with any form of media related to the controversy. Additionally, the term \\"episode\\" can have multiple meanings. In this context, the term \\"political episode\\" does not imply a literal television show or series. Instead, it is a figurative usage to describe a significant event or sequence of events that took place during the 1990s in American politics, involving the Whitewater controversy. It is essential to consider that the context focuses on the investigation into real estate dealings, and not the way Bill Clinton interacted with such a situation in terms of media exposure. In order to draw a different hypothesis from the context, one must examine the specific elements mentioned, such as: 1. The Whitewater controversy began as an investigation into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as their associates. 2. The Whitewater Development Corporation was a failed business venture from the 1970s and 1980s. An example of a hypothesis that could be drawn from this context could be: The Whitewater controversy led to a negative impact on Bill and Hillary Clinton's political image due to investigations into their involvement with the failed Whitewater Development Corporation. However, this hypothesis would also require further research in terms of the impact that the controversy had on their public image and political careers. In conclusion, the proposed hypothesis regarding Bill Clinton refusing to watch the episode is not supported by the context provided.

Given these facts, basal bodies function as organelles involved in what among the following options: - Plants growth - root growth - to move people - permineralization - cell division - Veins and arteries. - movement - Plant reproduction","completion":"Among the given options, basal bodies function as organelles involved in cell division. Centrioles and basal bodies are both cylindrical structures composed of microtubules, specifically arranged in a 9-triplet arrangement. Although they share structural similarities and basal bodies are known to function as centrioles, their roles and presence can differ depending on the cell type or organism. Cell division is a fundamental biological process that ensures the growth, maintenance, and reproduction of living organisms. In animal cells, centrioles play a crucial role during cell division by organizing the microtubules that form the mitotic spindle, which is responsible for the separation of chromosomes into the two daughter cells during mitosis. Centrioles duplicate during the cell cycle and migrate to opposite poles of the cell, anchoring the spindle fibers that pull the chromosomes apart. Basal bodies, on the other hand, are primarily associated with the base of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. Cilia and flagella are hair-like extensions that protrude from the cell surface and are involved in cell motility, sensation, and the movement of substances along the cell surface. Basal bodies share a similar microtubule organization as centrioles and also function as microtubule-organizing centers in cells with cilia or flagella. Furthermore, basal bodies can give rise to centrioles, and vice versa. Though centrioles and basal bodies both play roles in cell division, it is important to note differences across organisms. In plant cells, for example, centrioles and basal bodies are typically not present, as plant cells utilize a unique cell organelle called microtubule-organizing centers that aid in cell division. To sum up, basal bodies function as organelles involved in cell division due to their role as centrioles in animal cells. While other given options, such as plant growth, root growth, movement, or plant reproduction, may involve cellular processes in which cell division occurs, it is the direct involvement of basal bodies in the cell division process that makes this option the most accurate answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A learned expert on Secured Transactions from Mike's firm gave an opening address on the principles of granting and receiving the grantation of security interests. Almost completely irrelevant. The guy up and suggested that for a given transaction, the parties might consider giving a security interest in an office building, ie.real estate, as collateral. 2. A cannabalized EEI Credit Support Annex was tabled by Deedee Russo of Reliant and muddled through. The format was typically: Mike: \\"Okay guys, why don't you explain to me what you want.\\" Member: \\"We think we need this...blah blah blah, \\" Mike: \\"Okay, we'll put that into our next draft and have a conference call in December and a meeting in January and remember, none of this is binding, its all optional.\\" 3. At the very end, a lawyer from PacifiCorp managed to raise the vital issue and Mike got his hackles up very quickly. The PacifiCorp guy was basically saying that the WSPP was becoming more and more like the EEI and that this made it more and more difficult for parties to decide which agreement to use. His implication was that the WSPP should try to remain different or throw in the towel and be just like the EEI. Small reacted from a position of religion, dogmatically and loudly asserting that the two agreements were fundamentally different. Here is where he left himself open to the shining light of rational analysis: if someone, had the time, and we thought it mattered enough, the approach to take would be this: Dispassionate Spokesperson: A question has been raised: is the WSPP agreement becoming more or less like the EEI? To fairly answer this question one needs to look at all the changes that have been made by the WSPP in the last three years, comparing each change to the EEI agreement. (prepare comparison document). If we look at the evidence do we see convergence or divergence? The answer will be overwhelmingly convergence. If this objective study could be placed before the \\"Membership\\" it would speak for itself. Nobody would have to utter a word. The comparison document would do the job. If we are going to bother playing with these guys, this is what we should do. It would take some time, but if we circulated it to the membership and then merely raised the question of future direction, we might deal this tedious process a mortal blow. Believe it or not, the solution to this process is to follow the same process that went on when the King James Bible was put together in 1611. Various scholars took various views on how various Hebrew passages should be translated, and it took a committee of draftsmen, appointed and sent to Geneva by King James to pound out the form that has stood the test of time for centuries. The Joint Drafting Committee's time on the historical stage is finally arriving.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What are the best ways of falling asleep quickly? Question 2: What are some ways to fall asleep faster? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. Both questions are inquiring about strategies or methods that can be used to fall asleep more quickly. I will provide a detailed and long answer addressing the various ways to fall asleep faster. Falling asleep quickly is often a challenge for many people, especially those who suffer from insomnia or have irregular sleep schedules. Adopting good sleep hygiene and practicing various relaxation techniques can be highly effective in helping you fall asleep faster. Here are some of the best ways to achieve that: 1. Create a sleep-friendly environment: A comfortable and conducive sleep environment is crucial for falling asleep quickly. Ensure that your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet, as these conditions promote better sleep. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows that support your body. Eliminate any distractions, such as electronic devices or noise, that may interfere with your ability to relax. 2. Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up at the desired times. 3. Develop a pre-sleep routine: Create a relaxing bedtime routine that signals your body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep. This might include activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation. 4. Limit exposure to screens: The blue light emitted from screens on electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with your circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep. Try to avoid using these devices at least one hour before bedtime. 5. Prioritize physical activity: Regular exercise has been proven to help improve sleep quality. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime, as they may keep you awake. 6. Manage stress and anxiety: High levels of stress and anxiety can make it difficult for your brain to switch off at night. Incorporate stress management techniques such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation into your daily routine to help your body and mind relax. 7. Watch what you eat and drink: Be mindful of your diet, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime. Heavy or spicy meals, caffeine, and alcohol can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. If you're hungry, opt for a light snack rich in sleep-promoting nutrients, such as a slice of whole-grain toast with almond butter or a small bowl of yogurt with berries. 8. Limit daytime naps: Long or late-afternoon naps can make it harder for you to fall asleep at night. If you need to nap, keep it brief (20-30 minutes) and take it earlier in the day. 9. Try relaxation techniques: Engaging in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery, can help you unwind and transition into sleep more easily. 10. Consider sleep aids or supplements: Natural sleep aids, such as melatonin or valerian root, may help some people fall asleep faster. Always consult with a healthcare professional before using any sleep aids or supplements, as they may interact with medications or have side effects. In summary, falling asleep quickly requires creating a sleep-friendly environment, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, and incorporating relaxation techniques into your routine. It's also essential to manage stress, be mindful of your diet and exercise patterns, and consider sleep aids when necessary under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Remember that individual needs may vary, so it's important to experiment with different strategies to find the ones that work best for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's true that many dads in the wild aren't interested in parenting, but there are some that work pretty hard to give their little ones a good start. Maybe one of these dads will make you remember your own dad! The male giant water bug doesn't seem to mind a heavy load on his back for his kids. The female puts about 100 to 150 eggs on the back of the male, and then she leaves. Once the female is gone, the male has to look after the eggs. It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth. The male stickleback looks after all his young -- as many as 100 -- until they can live on their own. A similar example can be found in emperor penguins living in cold areas. The male emperor penguin goes without food while looking after his egg until it hatches. For about 62 to 67 days, the egg stays on top of the father's feet, in very cold temperatures that drop down to -39deg C. As a result, the father may lose nearly 50 percent of his body weight while waiting for his baby penguin to be born! Question: What is the best title for the text? Answer: Pick your answer from: A). Mr. Moms in the Wild. B). Animals Do Have Feelings. C). Nature Loves Us like Our Dad. D). Childbirth in the Animal Kingdom. The answer is:","completion":"A). Mr. Moms in the Wild. This title is the most appropriate since the article pertains to paternal involvement in differing animal species, focusing on the specific duties and sacrifices these animal fathers make for their offspring. It emphasizes on how they step into a more 'maternal' role which is typically associated with mothers in the animal kingdom. Hence, the phrase 'Mr. Moms' aptly captures this role reversal in wild animal fathers. Although the article does touch on aspects like feelings, love and childbirth, these are not its main focus, hence making options B, C and D less suitable for titles. The article mostly circles around the theme of fatherhood and care in animal species which is encapsulated neatly in the suggested title, 'Mr. Moms in the Wild'. This title not only points towards the main content of the text, but also helps to pique readers' interest and curiosity about these lesser-known facts in the animal kingdom."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What will happen to Carmilla if the Baron's descendant mixes blood with a virgin girl?, using the article: Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva.

The precise directions for tape cleaners vary, so refer to your instruction's manual to make sure you're using your cleaner correctly. Close the cleaner and press the clean button. Allow the cleaner to fully rewind the tape, cleaning the film as it goes. Most cleaners will have a button you press to run a cycle. If you're unsure how yours works, refer to the instruction's manual. Once the tape has run one cleaning cycle, remove the tape from the machine. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws from the casing that houses the film. After removing all the screws, separate the casings so you can reach the reels and film found inside. Sometimes, tapes will have a sticker or seal on the side to keep the casing together. If your tape is sealed, use a small knife to gently slice open the seal to open the tape. The majority of tapes can be opened with a Phillips head screwdriver. However, if a Phillips screwdriver does not work, use a flathead screwdriver instead. Store the screws in a safe place as you'll need them later to reassemble your tape. Dip a Q-tip in a small amount of isopropyl alcohol. Swab the sides of the casing and around the empty reel to remove mold, dirt, and debris. Avoid cleaning near the reel that the film is currently wrapped around. Only use your tape cleaner to remove mold from the film itself. You can purchase isopropyl alcohol at most drug stores. After running the tape through the cleaner again, you will clean the other reel. Therefore, do not screw the tape back together yet. Simply place the casings together again so they're loosely secured. Place your tape in the cleaner as you did before. This time, allow the tape to fast forward completely to remove any mold remaining on the film. Simply place the tape in the cleaner and then press the cleaning button. Once the tape runs through the cleaner again, remove it and open it up. Again, dip a q-tip in isopropyl alcohol. Use this to clean the empty real and around the interior of the casings. Remove any lingering mold, dirt, or debris. Remember not to clean near the reel that contains the film. Place the casings back together. Place the screws back in place. Use your screwdriver to securely screw the tape back together. If your tape had a sticker in place as a seal, it is not necessary to reseal your tape after cleaning it. You should always end the cleaning process with a rewound tape. Pop the tape back in the cleaner one last time. Rewind it to the beginning. When you're done, your VHS tape should be clean and ready to watch. Keep in mind, no method is ever 100% successful. Very dirty or damaged tapes may not come completely clean. You may need to consult a professional if your tape remains dirty or will not play after using a tape cleaner.","completion":"To clean a VHS tape, begin by fast-forwarding it to the end and placing it into your tape cleaner.

There, they meet Trip (Todd Kubrak), his girlfriend Chloe (Liz Osborn), and his lesbian friend Bridget (Marja Lewis Ryan). Molly and Bridget bond as they discuss Wuthering Heights and relationships. Molly tells Bridget that she has everything in common with her boyfriend, but Greg lacks passion. Bridget tells Molly that she doesn't have a girlfriend because no one can hold her interest for long enough to bother. Bridget is in fact flatmates with Trip where they always get up at the same time every morning and they both brush their teeth together while standing in front of the bathroom mirror.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Manhattan, cockroaches are spreading the deadly \\"Strickler's disease\\" that is claiming hundreds of the city's children. Entomologist Susan Tyler uses genetic engineering to create what her colleague (and husband) Peter Mann and she call the Judas breed, a large insect that releases an enzyme which causes the roaches metabolism to speed up and starve themselves to death. It successfully kills off the disease. The released population was all-female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, so that it would only last one generation. Three years later, a reverend is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, the \\"special\\" ward of an immigrant subway shoe-shiner named Manny. Two kids later sell a \\"weird bug\\" from the subway to Susan, which she performs test on, and realises is part of the Judas breed. Looking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find a large egg sac and are then killed. Chuy also enters the church to find \\"Mr. Funny Shoes\\" and is abducted. Peter, CDC officer Josh and subway cop Leonard enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get separated from Josh, who is then killed trying to find his way back up. Susan is taken from the train platform by one of the creatures and brought into the tunnels. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, before they barricade themselves in a train car. Susan surmises that the Judas' accelerated metabolism has allowed it to reproduce and that they have evolved to mimic their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels unless they are able to kill the single fertile male.

Given the question: You are given a new situation: Two teams of meteorologists studied environmental changes in Antarctica. Team A studied East Antarctica, while team B studied West Antarctica. They published their findings in a peer reviewed publication. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

In the question, it is stated that the robbers didn't just want the money the tellers had; they wanted to get a bigger load of money. Considering the other given options, \\"bank vault\\" is the most logical and relevant choice. An explanation of each option: 1. Art show: An art show is an event that displays artwork, which doesn't necessarily contain money, much less a significant amount of it. 2. Manager's desk: While it is possible for a bank manager to have money in their desk, it's unlikely to contain a large amount, as most bank funds are kept securely in the vault. 3. Pocket: This option implies that someone carries a large amount of cash in their pocket. In a bank setting, this is highly unlikely, as money is typically stored in more secure locations. 4. Water fountain: A water fountain is used for drinking water and has no relevance to storing or obtaining money, making it an illogical choice. 5. Bank vault: This option aligns with common sense because bank vaults are specifically designed to securely store large amounts of cash, valuable assets, and other items in a bank. Robbers targeting a bank would logically aim for the vault, knowing that it is where they could find the most significant sum of money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style?, what is it ?

Background: Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943 - January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time. Bobby Fischer showed great skill in chess from an early age; at 13, he won a brilliancy known as \\"The Game of the Century\\". At age 14, he became the US Chess Champion, and at 15, he became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship. Context: Bobby Fischer was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943. His birth certificate listed his father as Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, also known as Gerardo Liebscher, a German biophysicist. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was a US citizen, born in Switzerland; her parents were Polish Jews. Raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Regina became a teacher, registered nurse, and later a physician. After graduating from college in her teens, Regina traveled to Germany to visit her brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan to go to the United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945. At the time of her son's birth, Regina was \\"homeless\\" and shuttled to different jobs and schools around the country to support her family. She engaged in political activism, and raised both Bobby and Joan as a single parent. In 1949, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York City, where she studied for her master's degree in nursing and subsequently began working in that field. Question: Did she remarry? Answer:","completion":"There is no information provided about Regina Wender Fischer remarrying after her divorce from Hans-Gerhardt Fischer in 1945. Since the text does not mention any remarriage, we can assume that Regina remained a single parent raising both Bobby and Joan after the divorce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is the life of lab animals. Now consider the needs of these animals. Chimpanzees ,in their natural homes, are never separated from their families. They spend hours together every day. But in a lab, chimpanzees are put in cages alone. There are no families, only cold, hard cages, and loneliness that goes on for so many years that most of them lose their minds at last.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: When I think about the first time I saw a penis, it's like something out of a nightmare, or a really terrible Law & Order SVU episode. Blech. Too private a moment to share? I agree. But unfortunately the moment itself wasn't private – thanks to a grown man who exposed himself to me on a Queens subway platform when I was just 12 years old. I had just started taking the subway to school by myself, and had just barely missed the train, so the station was empty save for me and a man on the far end of the platform. When he started to masturbate, I didn't understand what he was doing. Then he started walking toward me. Luckily, another train pulled into the station before he reached me, and he quickly stopped what he had been doing and boarded. I stood there, frozen in place, as the doors slid shut. My hands wouldn't stop shaking. It would hardly be the first time I was flashed on a New York City subway – over the years, like a lot of young women, I endured ass-grabs, disgusting come-ons and a range of hisses, whistles and stares. For a long time, I thought there was something about me that invited the unwanted attention: it took until adulthood to realize that it was the common cost of being female in public spaces. Now a new report on street harassment supports what I got an inkling of that day on the subway: sexual public harassment and violence toward women is a widespread, national problem. The national study released on Tuesday from the nonprofit Stop Street Harassment shows that 65% of American women have experienced some form of street harassment – and 41% of all women were subject to physically aggressive harassment in public like being flashed or fondled. Men also report being harassed (and men who identified as LGBT were much more likely to be harassed than heterosexual men). No matter who was being harassed, men were most likely to be the harassers. The focus on public harassment feels particularly timely in the midst of #YesAllWomen – the hashtag that took women's grievances with sexism viral. Holly Kearl, founder of Stop Street Harassment, told me that the report backs up the experiences of women sharing their stories on #YesAllWomen: Most women have been the target of unwanted sexual or sexist commentary by men in public spaces and an alarming number have been followed, touched and assaulted by men. This harassment makes most women change their life in some way, like avoiding locations where they had been harassed, no longer going places alone, and even moving neighborhoods or quitting jobs. I was actually surprised that the number of women harassed wasn't much higher than 65% - maybe what we know is harassment has become so expected and commonplace we almost don't identify it as notable anymore. Oh, a penis behind a newspaper? Business as usual. Emily May, co-founder and Executive Director of Hollaback – an organization and online movement to end street harassment – says that what is exciting about the report and hashtag is that \\"this is what movements look like\\". \\"The conversation has just exploded,\\" she told me. But what makes street harassment difficult to tackle in everyday life is that there doesn't seem to be a clear-cut way to deal with it. Other countries have tried to implement female-only train cars to curb harassment, Italy opened a women-only beach to stop the leering and catcalling and now hotels are even offering floors dedicated only to female travellers. The message here is that women should change their behavior, not men. And what happens if women-only spaces become the norm and someone is harassed outside of one – will we blamed for not taking our designated train car? We deserve safety in public spaces, not just in segregated \\"safe zones\\". Until we reach the point where the majority of people get just how bad street harassment is, May says, we need to make people understand that they can intervene when they see it happening. \\"Teaching those bystander intervention strategies is an important step,\\" she added. Other women, like artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh, have taken to the street to make her point. Her series, Stop Telling Women to Smile, features portraits of women and captions that \\"speak directly to offenders, outside in public space\\". Kearl says the report and the uptick in conversations about women and safety, \\"should be a wake-up call to local and national leaders that if we ever want to achieve gender equality in the United States, we must address street harassment and make public places safer for everyone.\\" Whatever the method, something needs to be done. Because while street harassment is just one of many violations that American women endure, its prevalence is a clear message to women and men: there are no safe spaces for women. We need to be able to walk the street and simply be in public without fear. Not just for equality, but because, one day, I'd like my daughter to take the subway to school. ||||| This chart from the “Unsafe and Harassed in Public Spaces: A National Street Harassment Report,” illustrates the prevalence of street harassment among men and women in the United States. (Raquel Reichard) Stop Street Harassment, a nonprofit working to end sexual harassment in public spaces, just released the first national study on street harassment. Titled “Unsafe and Harassed in Public Spaces: A National Street Harassment Report,” it consists of data reported by 2,000 people surveyed by market research company Gfk, and information from 10 focus groups SSH held across the United States between February and March 2014. Many of the study’s findings support what has been suggested through the reader-submitted testimonials that SSH has been collecting since it was founded in 2008. “Across all age[s], races, income levels, sexual orientations, and geographic locations, most women in the United States experience street harassment. Some men, especially men who identify as gay, bisexual, queer, or transgender, do as well,” reads the executive summary, written by SSH’s founder, Holly Kearl. “There is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about what street harassment is. A lot of people think of the stereotype of a woman in a short skirt walking by a construction site, when it’s so much more than that. It really has a negative impact on harassed people’s lives,” said Kearl in a phone interview. “While my Web site and Hollaback‘s Web site collect so many stories, which are powerful, I think that they need to be supplemented by data to show the statistics of how many people are impacted,” she said. According to the study, 65 percent of women and 25 percent of men in the United States have experienced street harassment. Fifty-seven percent of women and 18 percent of men surveyed reported experiencing verbal harassment. Forty-one percent of the women and 16 percent of the men reported experiencing physical forms of street harassment, like flashing or groping. The study, which was funded by individual donors, had its limitations, the main one being diversity. Kearl would like to have gotten more responses from people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and teens to get a better understanding of how individuals’ intersecting identities alter the street harassment they experience. The types of street harassment reported by race. (Raquel Reichard) The study also showed respondents who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender were more likely to have experienced street harassment. “This includes verbal forms (57 percent compared to 37 percent of those who identified as heterosexual) and physically aggressive forms (45 percent compared to 28 percent, respectively),” the study reads. From “Unsafe and Harassed in Public Spaces: A National Street Harassment Report.” (Raquel Reichard) “Some of the demographics I’d like to see more research on include queer men of color, transgender individuals in general, and older gay/bisexual men, since my research identified an age curve for harassment, where the youngest and oldest participants experienced the most harassment. I’d also like to see more research on harassment of queer men by other queer men,” said SSH board member Patrick McNeil. “I’m happy that SSH’s report gave voice to some groups who often are not included, such as immigrant and Native American women,” he said. He said he also was glad that SSH has broadened the conversation about street harassment to include gay and bisexual men, particularly because he believes this form of street harassment is about perception. “Cis, straight men can certainly be perceived as gay, and that can impact the way they navigate public spaces, but it can also impact the way they treat women in order to prove their masculinity to other men,” said McNeil, who became involved with SSH after hearing Kearl speak to his graduate class at George Washington University, where he also studied public policy. He first began writing about street harassment on SSH’s blog, and joined the board this year and wrote his thesis on how gay and bisexual people experience street harassment. “Ninety percent of the men in my research said they sometimes, often, or always feel unwelcome in public spaces because of their sexual orientation. And whether that translates to actual acts of harassment is, in my mind, immaterial. One reason street harassment is so paralyzing is because it affects us even when it’s not actually happening to us,” McNeil said. “I think the biggest takeaway from my research in particular was that — as this report suggests — street harassment has lasting effects long after individual incidents. About 71 percent of the men who took my survey said they constantly assess their surroundings when navigating public spaces, and that should concern us,” he said. That is one of the reasons why SSH identifies street harassment as a human rights issue: It limits the way harassees are able to move about their communities by making them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. One of the other issues was getting study participants to accurately identify harassment. Public, sexual harassment is so normal that harassees do not always mentally flag their experiences as something serious, unless physically aggressive harassment is involved. “Some people would say, ‘I was only harassed once,’ and would recount a physical experience, but as the conversation continued, there were verbal experiences that came up,” Kearl said. Kearl was surprised that out of the 91 percent of the survey participants who believed there are ways to end street harassment, 55 percent of them felt that the best way was to install more security cameras and increase the police presence in their communities, while 53 percent of respondents suggested educational workshops about respectful interactions with strangers. “I wonder if that’s why street harassment is such a big problem, in part, because parents and adults aren’t talking to kids about it. They’re just kind of living the example of what they see out there, and they don’t necessarily understand why this is a problem, so we just have the cycle perpetuate,” said Kearl, who co-authored a national study on sexual harassment among children in grades 7 through 12 in 2011. She believes that talking to children about respect, consent and what is appropriate and inappropriate humor (in another harassment survey, many boys reported harassing other people as a joke) can help to end the cycle. “A national study like this one is so important because it confirms what street harassment writers and researchers — and those affected by street harassment — already knew: that it’s not just a compliment or the price you pay for being a woman or for being gay,” McNeil said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief explanation or outline of the main points of a text, story, or event.

To evade danger, they seek refuge in an abandoned animal hospital, intending to patch up their wounds and plot their next moves. As they enter the eerie and desolate building, our protagonists discover that the animal hospital is not what it seems. The hospital, once an innocuous structure, has now become a stronghold for various mutated creatures who have developed unique abilities due to experiments that were conducted there before humanity's downfall. They soon find out that they are trapped, and the only way to survive is to ally themselves with these strange beings. In their time at the animal hospital, John and Kate learn the importance of trust, building relationships and understanding unspoken bonds with the creatures. They become emotionally invested in the well-being of these once mistreated animals, vowing to protect them from harm. However, unbeknownst to them, the T-X has caught up with their location, and a brutal battle ensues.

Question: Who claimed the entire Delaware River? Is \\"Europeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River opposite the Schuylkill River in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"The statement you provided is partially correct. Europeans, indeed, arrived in the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The Dutch were among the first to establish settlements in the region, including the construction of Fort Nassau on the Delaware River. However, to provide a detailed answer to the question of who claimed the entire Delaware River, it is important to consider the historical context of the colonization and territorial disputes among different European powers in the region. The Dutch, under the Dutch West India Company, were the first Europeans to claim the entire Delaware River when they established the New Netherland colony in 1624. The colony, which included parts of present-day New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Connecticut, aimed to assert Dutch control over the fur trade in the region, particularly along the Hudson River and the Delaware River. In 1626, Peter Minuit, Director-General of New Netherland, purchased the island of Manhattan from native tribes, expanding the Dutch influence in the region. By 1638, the Swedish also entered the region and established the New Sweden colony, which was centered on present-day Wilmington, Delaware. Led by Peter Minuit, who now worked for the Swedish, they built Fort Christina on the banks of the Delaware River, which led to territorial disputes with the Dutch. In 1655, the Dutch, led by Peter Stuyvesant, Director-General of New Netherland, captured Fort Christina, effectively ending Swedish control in the region and re-establishing Dutch control over the entire Delaware River. However, in 1664, the British seized control of New Netherland, and subsequently, the entire Delaware River, when they captured the Dutch port of New Amsterdam (present-day New York City) without bloodshed. The British renamed the settlement New York in honor of the Duke of York, who later became King James II. In 1681, King Charles II of England granted William Penn a land charter for the region now known as Pennsylvania, including what is today Delaware. Penn's objective was to establish a Quaker colony in the Americas. Under Penn's governance, the settlements along the Delaware River grew rapidly, and the city of Philadelphia, founded in 1682, emerged as a major economic and political center in British America. Despite numerous territorial disputes and border changes throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, it is clear that multiple European powers made claims to the entire Delaware River at different points in time. Throughout this tumultuous period, the Dutch were the first to claim the entire river upon the establishment of New Netherland in 1624. However, it is important to acknowledge that the region saw a prolonged struggle for control among the Dutch, Swedish, and English until the American Revolution, which culminated in the United States asserting sovereignty over the Delaware River and its surrounding territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: In infrared photography, infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. Digital cameras often use infrared blockers. Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can \\"see\\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called 'T-ray' imaging, which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.

Among Bring Me the Horizon's earliest influences were bands like At the Gates, Carcass, Pantera, Metallica, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, Norma Jean, Skycamefalling and Poison the Well; and genres death metal, grindcore, and emo have been cited by AllMusic writer Steward Mason. However, as their sound developed, the band started to take influences from progressive rock, post-rock, dubstep and electronica. The band's musical style has been described mainly as metalcore and - though they have since moved on from the genre - their early material was considered deathcore. Across their career the band has also been said to play within the genres post-hardcore, hardcore punk, technical metal, heavy metal, and emo. Bring Me the Horizon have attempted to grow and change with each album, believing they should be different. Raziq Rauf, writing for Drowned In Sound, described Count Your Blessings as possessing \\"Norma Jean-style thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly sludgy doom moments and more breakdowns than your dad's old Nissan Sunny.\\" Metal Hammer described Suicide Season as a \\"creative, critical and commercial success\\" for the band as they started to adopt a more eclectic style, with its \\"crushingly heavy party deathcore\\". Leading up to its release Oliver Sykes described it as \\"100% different to Count Your Blessings\\" and noted the album sounds \\"more rock than metal\\". As time went by, Bring Me the Horizon began rejecting their debut album Count Your Blessings and considered Suicide Season as their \\"Year Zero[...] [their] wipe-the-slate-clean time\\". Bring Me the Horizon then moved even further away from deathcore with their third album There Is a Hell, which incorporated electronica, classical music and pop music into their metalcore style. This required more ambitious production feats, such as using a full choir, a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns that were also toned down, favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks. For the writing of Sempiternal, the band pooled far broader influences such as post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky and from pop music. Bring Me the Horizon has experimented with its music in recent years, mixing pop with metal music, leading the band to be labeled a \\"pop metal\\" act. With the release of That's the Spirit, their sound shifted towards alternative metal and alternative rock, also incorporated other genres such as pop rock and nu metal, while completely abandoning the metalcore sound of their earlier albums. Answer this question \\"Who did they model their style after?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Bring Me the Horizon modeled their style after bands like At the Gates, Carcass, Pantera, Metallica, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, Norma Jean, Skycamefalling, and Poison the Well.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] and the situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Answer the following question: Which lake has more geothermal activity? Answer:","completion":"Deep Lake has more geothermal activity. The background information states that in lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"Based on the content of the provided product review, the portrayal of the trio of films is decidedly unflattering. A negative sentiment is clearly expressed throughout the review, and there are several indications that the reviewer holds an unfavorable opinion of the films. Firstly, the fact that the reviewer mentions they were \\"dragged\\" to the films by their husband implies that they were reluctant to attend the screenings in the first place, possibly anticipating that they would not enjoy the viewing experience. This choice of wording sets a negative tone right at the beginning of the review. Secondly, the reviewer's assertion that they \\"couldn't stand any contrived one of them\\" is a strong statement that underscores the dissatisfaction they had with the entire lineup of films. The use of the term \\"contrived\\" denotes that the reviewer found the movies to be lacking in authenticity and originality. They perceived the plots as overly manufactured and artificial, which is generally regarded as a negative quality when assessing any form of art, especially films. Lastly, the claim that \\"the actors all phoned it in\\" is an accusation that reflects poorly on the cast's performances, suggesting that they did not invest the necessary effort and emotion into their roles. The phrase \\"phoned it in\\" implies that the actors were not fully present and involved in their characters, resulting in a lackluster and superficial portrayal. This further cements the negative nature of the review. In conclusion, the product review at hand paints the trio of films in a highly unflattering light, with a clear dissatisfaction expressed regarding the plots, the lack of originality, and the overall performances of the actors involved. This negative sentiment is conveyed through the reviewer's choice of words, indicating an unfavorable opinion that undoubtedly impacts the perception of potential viewers who come across it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People in the city are less healthy compared to to the people in the countryside, due to the clean air in the","completion":"countryside and the abundance of fresh, unprocessed food. City dwellers seem to be constantly surrounded by pollution, noise, and unhealthy food options that contribute to their increased stress levels, making them more prone to illness. In the bustling city of Metropolia, it's common for residents to spend their days working long hours in the confines of their offices, rarely finding the time to enjoy the outdoor spaces that the city has to offer. The air is heavy with pollutants from cars and industries, and the constant hum of traffic drowns out the soothing sounds of nature. Green spaces are limited, with cramped living conditions and soaring skyscrapers dominating the skyline. In the little free time that city dwellers have, they often choose to spend it inside, either glued to their electronic devices or engaging in unhealthy activities, such as consuming fast-food or indulging in alcohol and drugs. Contrastingly, life in the countryside seems idyllic. Rolling hills, forests, and vast open spaces have a calming effect on those who call the countryside their home. The air is cleaner – the gentle breeze carrying the earthy scent of soil and the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers. Days are filled with outdoor activities like walking, cycling, gardening, and farming. Life revolves around nature's clock, with the rising sun being a cue to begin the activities of the day, and the fading twilight prompting a retreat back into the warmth of home. The people of the countryside have a greater connection to the food they eat. Many still maintain small subsistence farms or local farmers' markets, where fresh, organic produce is grown, harvested, and shared. Family recipes, passed down for generations, utilize these bountiful ingredients, cherishing and respecting the earth's offerings. This deep connection to the land fosters a sense of responsibility to preserve and care for the environment, ultimately leading to a more sustainable lifestyle. City dwellers, Lucas and Jessica, were growing weary of the constant stress in Metropolia. They longed for an escape – an opportunity to experience the simplicity and tranquility promised by life in the countryside. One day, with this craving for change becoming too strong to ignore, they decided to leave their city jobs and purchase a small cottage on the outskirts of a picturesque rural village. Weeks turned into months as Lucas and Jessica fell into a new rhythm of life. They would rise early, tend to their newly-established vegetable garden, and explore the sprawling meadows and trails that surrounded their home. They were welcomed warmly by their neighbors, who taught them the customs and traditions of their new community. With each passing day, Lucas and Jessica felt their stress levels and health concerns dissipating, replaced instead by renewed energy, profound appreciation for their surroundings, and enhanced well-being. As time went by, the couple's passion for their new lifestyle grew into a desire to share its benefits with their friends and family from the city. They began inviting small groups of guests to their cottage, educating them on sustainable living practices and survival skills, while simultaneously giving them a chance to unwind and recenter. Through word of mouth, their informal gatherings began to attract more and more urban dwellers seeking to break free from the shackles of city life even for a short time. Their initiative gradually blossomed into a thriving eco-retreat to promote the benefits of living in harmony with nature.

Article: The journey two naval officers made some time ago to the very deepest point on the earth makes us realize how much of the world still remains to be explored. The two men went down seven miles to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean inside a small steel ball called a \\"bathyscaphe\\" to find out if there are any ocean currents or sings of life. It was necessary to set out early, so that the \\"bathyscaphe\\" would come to the surface in daylight, and so be easily found by the mother ship which would be waiting for it. The drivers began preparations at dawn and soon afterwards, when all was ready, the steel ball disappeared under the surface of the water. In time, the temperature dropped to freezing-point and the men trembled inside the ball. They kept in touch with the mother ship by telephone describing how they felt. Then, at a depth of 3,000 feet, the men were surprised by a sudden, loud noise, even the smallest hole in the ball would have meant instant death. Luckily, though, it was only one of the outer windows that had broken. Soon afterwards, the \\"bathyscaphe\\" touched the soft ocean floor raising a big cloud of \\"dust\\" made up of different kinds of small, dead sea animals. Here, powerful lights lit up the dark water and the men were surprised to see fish swimming just above them quite uncontrolled by the very large water-pressure. But they did not dare to leave the lights on for long, as the heat from them made the water boil. Quite unexpectedly, the telephone began working again and the weak but clear voices of the officers wre heard on the mother ship. After a stay of thirty minutes the men began their journey up, arriving three hours later, _ . Question: The journey to the bottom of the sea helped us to realize that _ .

The article highlights the incredible experience of two naval officers who embarked on a deep-sea exploration to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, reaching a depth of seven miles within a bathyscaphe. This incredible journey not only showcases the sheer depths that remain unexplored within our own planet, but also highlights the challenges and potential discoveries that await us as we continue to survey the world beneath our oceans. Throughout their descent, the officers encountered various challenges, including freezing temperatures and extreme water pressure. Yet, despite these severe conditions, they discovered signs of life at the bottom of the ocean, with fish swimming just above the soft ocean floor. This observation reveals that life can thrive in seemingly inhospitable environments and underscores just how much we still have to learn about the world and its inhabitants. Moreover, the limitations experienced by the officers—such as only being able to use powerful lights for a brief time before the heat causes the surrounding water to boil—demonstrate the technological advancements that are still needed to fully explore and understand our oceans. Their phone communication reestablishing connection after touching the ocean floor points to the ongoing requirement for innovation in communication and data transmission for deep-sea exploration. Ultimately, this journey to the bottom of the sea highlights the fact that there is still much of the world that remains unexplored and further emphasizes the need for continued scientific and technological advancements in order to better understand and appreciate the depths of our planet's oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The more basic a solution is, the closer its pH value will be to 14. Tanya was measuring pH values and recorded a value of 13 for Solution #1. She also recorded a value of 8 for Solution #2. Which solution is less basic Solution #2 or Solution #1? A:","completion":"Solution #2 is less basic compared to Solution #1. To understand this, let's first refresh on the pH scale. The pH scale is a measure of acidity or basicity/alkalinity of a solution and ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 indicates a neutral solution, meaning it is neither acidic nor basic. A pH value below 7 denotes an acidic solution, while a pH value above 7 is considered basic (or alkaline). The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in the acidity/basicity of the solution. A solution with a pH value of 6 is 10 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 7, and a solution with a pH value of 5 is 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 7. Now, let's examine Tanya's results. She recorded a pH value of 13 for Solution #1 and a pH value of 8 for Solution #2. Solution #1 has a pH value of 13, which is very close to 14, indicating that it is a strongly basic solution. In fact, it is 10^5 (100,000) times more basic than a neutral solution with a pH of 7. Solution #2 has a pH value of 8, which is closer to 7. This indicates that it is a mildly basic solution. It is 10^1 (10) times more basic than a neutral solution with a pH of 7. Comparing the two solutions, we can conclude that Solution #2 is less basic than Solution #1 as its pH value is lower and closer to neutrality, while Solution #1 is much more strongly basic, with a pH value closer to the high end of the pH scale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(B). crystal structure is too hard to determine.. (C). crystal size is determined by the environment.. (D). minerals have different recognizable properties..","completion":"Minerals can be identified using hardness, streak, and cleavage because (D) minerals have different recognizable properties. These physical properties serve as critical clues for amateurs and professional geologists alike in the identification and study of various minerals found in the Earth's crust. This is because minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic, and solid substances, with well-defined chemical compositions and ordered internal structures which gives rise to these distinct properties. 1. Hardness: The hardness of a mineral is its relative resistance to scratching or abrasion. It's a measure of the strength of a mineral's atomic bonds. The hardness property is essential for identifying a mineral because different minerals have varying hardness levels. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is a standard method used by geologists to classify and compare the hardness of minerals. On the Mohs scale, minerals are ranked on a scale from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest). For example, talc, with a Mohs hardness of 1, is the softest mineral, whereas diamond, with a hardness of 10, is the hardest. By determining the hardness of an unknown mineral, geologists can narrow down the list of possible minerals it could be. 2. Streak: Streak refers to the color of the powder left behind when a mineral is rubbed or scraped against an unglazed porcelain plate, known as a streak plate. The streak property is helpful for identifying minerals as it remains consistent, regardless of the color variations that mineral samples might possess. Some minerals can have a similar appearance in their solid form, but their streak colors may differ significantly, allowing for better differentiation between the minerals. For example, hematite and magnetite may both appear black or silvery gray, but hematite produces a red or reddish-brown streak, while magnetite gives off a black streak. 3. Cleavage: Cleavage is the ability of a mineral to break along flat, parallel planes, which corresponds to zones of weak atomic bonding within the crystal structure. The cleavage property is essential for identifying minerals because it demonstrates the inherent structure of a mineral's crystal lattice. Minerals with cleavage break in specific directions and commonly exhibit smooth, shiny surfaces when they break. These cleavage patterns can help geologists distinguish between similarly appearing minerals. For example, biotite has excellent cleavage in one direction, whereas muscovite has excellent cleavage in one direction as well, but its cleavage is more flexible than that of biotite. By using these distinct and recognizable properties like hardness, streak, and cleavage, geologists can systematically assess and identify various minerals found amid Earth's diverse geological formations. These properties aid in categorizing and understanding the minerals' formation, composition, and potential applications in various industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Conan's father is killed by dogs, and his sword is taken by Doom to decapitate Conan's mother. The children are taken into slavery; Conan is chained to a large mill, the Wheel of Pain. Years of pushing the huge grindstone build up his muscles. His master trains him to be a gladiator, and after winning many pit fights, Conan is freed. As he wanders the world, he encounters a witch and befriends Subotai, a thief and archer.[10][11] Following the witch's advice, Conan and Subotai go to Shadizar, in the land of Zamora, to seek out Doom.[12] They meet Valeria, a female brigand, who becomes Conan's lover.

Context: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

From the information given, we can deduce that the situation with health insurance in Texas is concerning as it ranks poorly in providing coverage for families, children, and women. Here is a detailed analysis of the paragraph: 1. The speaker acknowledges that they are not certain about all the percentages mentioned by someone else. This implies that there might have been an ongoing discussion or debate on the topic of health insurance. 2. The speaker speculates that the person being addressed did not directly answer a question about the accuracy of certain numbers related to health insurance in Texas. This could be due to the person maybe trying to avoid acknowledging these numbers, or the fact that they are not knowledgeable enough about the topic to give a definitive answer. 3. The speaker then mentions that Texas ranks dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women. These statistics suggest that providing health insurance coverage to families, children, and women appears to be a significant issue in Texas. 4. Since the phrase \\"health insurance has a zzz\\" is not mentioned anywhere in the paragraph, we cannot directly draw any conclusions or make assumptions about its meaning or relevance to the situation in Texas. In conclusion, based on the paragraph, we can infer that the health insurance situation in Texas is concerning due to its low ranking in providing coverage for families, children, and women.

I can not accept your invitation. We accept the idea of universal health care.","completion":"While the verb \\"accept\\" is used in both sentences, the meanings differ depending on the context they are used in. In the first sentence, \\"I cannot accept your invitation,\\" 'accept' has a concrete, physical connotation, where it refers to the act of receiving or taking something that is being offered, in this case, an invitation. Here, 'accept' conveys a notion of consent or agreement to participate in an event, gathering, or activity that has been proposed by someone else. In the second sentence, \\"We accept the idea of universal health care,\\" 'accept' is used in a more abstract, conceptual sense. Here, it means to regard something as true, proper, or normal; to give approval to something or agree with it. In this case, it's about recognizing the concept or idea of universal health care as something valid or plausible. So, while 'accept' in both sentences involves a form of agreement or consent, the context determines whether it applies to a physical or tangible offer (like an invitation) or an intangible one (like an idea or a concept).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: if a solution is blue what color will it show the most response in terms of absorption?","completion":"To answer this question, we need to consider the principles of color and light absorption, as well as the concept of complementary colors. When an object (or a solution, in this case) appears blue, it means that the majority of the wavelengths of light being reflected or transmitted from the solution correspond to blue colors. Color can be described using the visible light spectrum, which ranges from approximately 400 to 700 nanometers (nm). The blue color falls within the range of 450 to 495 nm. The colors that we see are a result of certain wavelengths of light being absorbed by the object while others are reflected or transmitted. When a solution is blue, it means that the majority of the light absorbed by the solution is in the color range opposite or complementary to blue. The visible light spectrum consists of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet colors. Thus, complementary colors are the ones found on the opposite sides of each other within the color wheel. In the case of the color blue, the complementary color is orange, which falls within the wavelength range of approximately 590 to 625 nm. Therefore, if a solution is blue, it will show the most response in terms of absorption in the orange range of the light spectrum. The absorption of the orange light wavelengths primarily contributes to the blue appearance of the solution. To summarize, when a solution appears blue, it shows the most response in terms of absorption for the orange color range (approximately 590 to 625 nm wavelengths). This is due to the principle of complementary colors, where orange is the complementary color of blue. Consequently, the majority of the transmitted or reflected light is blue while orange light is absorbed by the solution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kyle liked the new wallpaper but not Nick because","completion":"Nick thought the design was too chaotic for his taste. The wallpaper was full of vibrant colors, abstract patterns, and swirling shapes that seemed to leap right off the walls. Kyle, on the other hand, thought the design brought energy and excitement to the room, giving it a modern and edgy vibe. Step 1: Assess the characters' opinions. In this situation, it's important to understand the characters' opinions on the wallpaper. Kyle likes the new design, while Nick finds it too chaotic and overwhelming. Knowing this, I can continue the story by portraying their differences and potentially establishing conflict or compromise between them. Step 2: Move the story forward. To progress the story, I'll add dialogue or actions involving the characters and continue developing the plot around their opposing views on the wallpaper. Step 3: Introduce conflict or compromise. As I continue the story, I'll consider elements that could either exacerbate their disagreement or lead them toward a resolution. This could involve other characters or unexpected events, or their personal growth and change. Continuing the story: One day, Kyle invited a few friends over for a small get-together. When they entered the room with the new wallpaper, the reactions were mixed. Some loved the bold patterns, while others agreed with Nick that it was a bit overwhelming. During their conversation, an idea struck Nick. \\"Why don't we try to find a middle ground? We can keep the wallpaper on one wall as an accent piece and paint the rest of the room with a more neutral color,\\" he suggested to Kyle. Step 4: Evaluate the outcome. By introducing other characters with varying opinions, I've helped to create a more dynamic and realistic scenario. Additionally, Nick's suggestion demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could ultimately resolve their differences. Step 5: Wrap up the story. To bring the story to a satisfying conclusion, I'll describe the characters' final decisions regarding the wallpaper and any resulting changes in their relationship or environment. Kyle thought for a moment, then realized Nick had a valid point. \\"You're right,\\" he conceded. \\"We could still showcase the unique design while making sure the room doesn't feel too hectic.\\" They agreed to implement the new plan, bonding over their project's execution. In the end, Kyle and Nick were pleased with their combined efforts. The room showcased both their personalities - capturing the excitement of the abstract design in a more harmonious, balanced setting. This small but significant compromise strengthened their friendship, realizing the importance of considering each other's tastes and preferences when making any decision together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Just as the threat of a siege became evident, the captain of the city, Dom Luís Freire de Andrade ordered the evacuation of women, children and elderly to Goa and barricades be set up in the main streets with artillery. In October, Dom Francisco de Mascarenhas arrived from Goa with 600 men and immediately ordered the digging of an extensive network of ditches, trenches, earthen walls and defensive works around the outer perimeter of the city, fortifying outer households into blockhouses and demolishing others to clear the line of fire for the artillery. In December 15, the vanguard of the army of Ahmadnagar, arrived under the command of an Ethiopian general, Faratecão , and clashed with the Portuguese, who repelled the attack. The Nizam arrived with the rest of his army on December 21. Through a spy, the Portuguese uncovered that the forces of the Nizam Ul-Mulk Shah of Ahmadnagar might have risen up to 120,000 men, including many Turkic, Abyssian, Persian, Afghan and Mughal mercenaries, 38,000 horsemen and 370 war elephants, supported by 38 heavy bombards.

What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake.

Let's break down the details of the premise and critically evaluate the provided statement: Premise: \\"um but i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel and that way i get the little extra exercise\\" The premise outlines three key pieces of information: 1. The person has a towel that sits on the floor. 2. They pick up the towel every time they get up to bowl. 3. This action gives them a little extra exercise. Now, let's evaluate these points in relation to the hypothesis: 1. The presence of the towel on the floor cannot directly support or refute the hypothesis that the doctor believes the person is in desperate need of more exercise. This point alone does not provide any relevant information about the doctor's opinion or the person's current exercise habits. 2. Picking up the towel each time they get up to bowl suggests that the person may be consciously trying to incorporate additional physical activity into their routine. However, this action in itself may not necessarily signify that they are in desperate need of more exercise. It could also indicate that they are simply trying to maintain their current level of physical activity or improve their overall fitness. 3. The premise states that bending over to pick up the towel provides a little extra exercise but does not elaborate on the extent or significance of this extra exercise. It is unclear whether this action alone would be sufficient to fulfill the person's exercise requirements, as prescribed by their doctor. Considering the above points, we cannot conclusively determine whether the hypothesis \\"My doctor said I'm in desperate need of more exercise\\" is true based solely on the premise. While it is evident that the person is attempting to incorporate additional physical activity into their routine by bending over to pick up their towel, there is no explicit or implicit indication that they are enacting this habit specifically because their doctor indicated that they are in desperate need of more exercise. To establish the validity of the hypothesis, additional information would be necessary. For example, we may need to know what the doctor's actual recommendation was, whether the person has a history of sedentary behavior, or if they have any health issues that necessitate increased physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Just WOW, No words to describe it. . Where should I start, Well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game. It was of course FFVII, I was BLOWN AWAY by the game. At the time I was 7 years old. I immediatly bought the game and played it straight through. I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that). Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing. Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it. The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost 29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay 100 for this.

Please answer the following question: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals? Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the hint, the Mobutu pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals. This is because they were following large groups of zebras and other grazers, which are known to create confusion for predators due to their group size and striped patterns. Additionally, the rapid movement of the zebras creates a motion dazzle effect that further complicates the predator's ability to focus on an individual prey animal. On the other hand, the Simba pack was targeting wounded individual prey animals, which would presumably be easier to single out and attack."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Glam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter. Glam artists drew on diverse sources ranging from bubblegum pop and '50s rock and roll to cabaret theatrics, science fiction, and complex art rock. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been described as playing with nontraditional gender roles. - Strawbs (or The Strawbs) are an English rock band founded in 1964. Although the band started out as a bluegrass group they eventually moved on to other styles such as folk rock, progressive rock, and (briefly) glam rock. - Hounslow is the principal town in the London Borough of Hounslow in Greater London and is part of the historic county of Middlesex. It is a suburban district 10.6 miles (17 km) west south-west of Charing Cross. It forms a larger post town in the TW postcode area and is an economic hub within the capital; it has a large shopping centre which adjoins its high street and a large number of restaurants, cafés and small businesses, many of which are associated with product assembly, marketing, telecommunications and London Heathrow Airport. A minority of its workers are employed in Central London, to which the town is connected by rail and tube. Hounslow is part of the TW3 postcode area, though some areas to the west are in TW4 instead. The population of the town, comprising the Hounslow Central, Hounslow Heath and Hounslow South wards, was 41,304 in the 2011 census. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Richard Christopher \\"Rick\\" Wakeman (born 18 May 1949) is an English keyboardist, songwriter, television and radio presenter, and author. He is best known for being in the progressive rock band Yes across five tenures between 1971 and 2004 and for his solo albums released in the 1970s. - Grave New World is a studio album by English band Strawbs . It was the first album to be released after the departure of Rick Wakeman , under circumstances about which band leader Dave Cousins was very bitter . Cousins has admitted that the track \`\` Tomorrow '' was written about Wakeman . Happily their friendship survived and the two have since performed and recorded together , releasing an album Hummingbird in 2002 . Wakeman 's departure to join prog - rockers Yes caused a lot of predictions of Strawbs demise . Cousins was into the I Ching at the time and he asked the book what he should do . The answer was used in the lyrics for the first track on the album , \`\` Benedictus '' . Blue Weaver , late of Amen Corner , was recruited and considered by most fans to be a more than adequate replacement for Wakeman . The album depicts the story of one man 's life . For instance , the track \`\` Hey Little Man '' represents an older man giving advice to his young son . The songs themselves show the continuation of the movement away from Strawbs ' original folk leanings . Founding member Tony Hooper began to be increasingly uncomfortable with this and left after the recording sessions of this album . The original vinyl album had lavish artwork and included a pamphlet showing the lyrics of each track together with details of instrumentation . The front cover is a reproduction of William Blake 's Glad Day . The album reached number 11 in the UK Album Charts . - Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation. The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued. - Dave Cousins (born David Joseph Hindson, 7 January 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex, England) is an English singer and songwriter, who has been the leader, singer and most active songwriter of Strawbs since 1967. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. What object entity has the relation of 'genre' with the subject 'grave new world'?

Should Real Madrid sell Cristiano Ronaldo?","completion":"While the two questions might appear similar at first glance, there are subtle differences that make their implications and scope distinct from one another. 1. \\"2016: Would Real Madrid be better off without Cristiano Ronaldo?\\" This question poses a hypothetical: it asks whether Real Madrid's performance would improve, remain the same, or degrade if Cristiano Ronaldo were not part of the team during the specified year, 2016. The question does not directly imply any action, such as selling or releasing the player. It may also include possible non-financial aspects of the team's performance, such as team cohesion, player development, or the overall impact of Ronaldo's absence on the squad. To answer this question, one could analyze Real Madrid's play style in 2016, its performance record, and its dependence on Ronaldo. One could also examine the potential impact of his absence on the morale and mindset of the team and its supporters. Moreover, it would be important to consider alternative scenarios, such as how different players could fill the void left by Ronaldo or how Ronaldo might have been utilized to strategically enhance Real Madrid's performance in 2016, even if he did not play as many minutes. 2. \\"Should Real Madrid sell Cristiano Ronaldo?\\" This question directly asks whether Real Madrid should take the financial and strategic action of selling Cristiano Ronaldo, thereby potentially changing the team's future performance and trajectory. Answering this question would require an evaluation of potential transfer offers, Real Madrid's financial situation, and the strategic implications of losing the player. An important aspect to consider when answering this question is whether Real Madrid could find a suitable replacement for Ronaldo, who represented a significant portion of the team's goal-scoring and attacking prowess. Assessing the possible financial gains and losses from selling the player, such as earnings from the transfer fee in comparison to the financial impact of losing a star player, would also be crucial. Additionally, the question invites a broader assessment of Real Madrid's goals, priorities, and future plans, as selling Ronaldo could have a significant impact on the team's brand image and global presence. In conclusion, the two questions differ in the way they are framed and the issues they encompass. The first question focuses on a hypothetical scenario of a Ronaldo-less Real Madrid in the specified year, 2016, and could consider both on-field performance and off-field intangibles. The second question revolves around the rationale for selling Ronaldo, encompassing aspects such as transfer fees, player replacement, and the future strategic direction of the club. While both questions ultimately pertain to Cristiano Ronaldo's role on the Real Madrid team, they are not the same due to their different base perspectives and implications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Italy Quake Destroys £200m Worth Of Cheese Oriano Caretti, the owner of parmigiano factory in San Giovanni, inspects some ruined cheese An earthquake in northern Italy has destroyed more than 300,000 wheels of cheese worth an estimated 250 million euros (£200m). The magnitude-6.0 earthquake killed at least six people, injured dozens and damaged historic buildings including a famed medieval castle early on Sunday, waking terrified citizens and sending thousands running into the streets. The tremor has also devastated the region's cheese industry, destroying tonnes of Parmesan and Grana Padano. The quake was Italy's strongest in three years \\"The earthquake was very strong and heavily damaged the structures of many warehouses as well as thousands of tonnes [of the two cheeses]\\", said Stefano Berni, head of a consortium that protects the Grana Padano designation. \\"It's a very heavy loss, but there have been no casualties, which is a great relief at this worrying time,\\" he told the ANSA news agency. The initial estimate of 250 million euros is \\"very conservative\\", Mr Berni said, adding that he hoped no further tremors would \\"further aggravate the state of the already highly damaged and fragile structures\\". A wheel of the cheese can weigh up to 40kgs (90lbs), meaning up to thousands of tonnes of the product was destroyed. The epicentre of the quake, Italy's strongest in three years, was near Modena in the Emilia-Romagna region of the Po valley. A series of strong aftershocks hit the area, two of which had a magnitude of 5.1. ||||| Story highlights An aftershock with a magnitude of 3.2 causes buildings to shake Up to 11,000 people are displaced, with survivors huddling in tents and cars Italian PM Mario Monti cuts short his NATO summit trip after earthquake It's Italy's third big quake since 2009 Northern Italy was shaken by an aftershock Monday morning, a day after a magnitude-6.0 quake killed at least seven people and left thousands of survivors huddling in tents or cars overnight. Monday morning's aftershock caused buildings to sway in the town of Finale Emilia, in Italy's industrial heartland. The tremor had a magnitude of 3.2 and hit near the site of the original quake, according to the Italian Seismic Service. The head of Italy's Civil Protection Department, Franco Gabrielli, said 11,000 people had been displaced by the first quake around 4 a.m. (10 p.m. Saturday ET) on Sunday morning. The government put 3,000 people up in tents or hotels, but could not shelter everyone who was displaced. Although a moderate rain fell on the area Monday, the local weather forecast called for partly cloudy skies and dry conditions to prevail by Tuesday. In Finale Emilia, about 35 kilometers (21 miles) north of Bologna, 75 people were sleeping in cars in a public park. One of them was Filomenna Gatti, who planned to cram into a Fiat Punto with her husband and three children under 6. 3 photos: Earthquake in Italy: Before and after 3 photos: Earthquake in Italy: Before and after Earthquake in Italy: Before and after – A magnitude 6.0 earthquake shook northern Italy on Sunday, killing at least seven people and destroying centuries-old landmarks including the clock tower in Finale Emilia.

Monti said Sunday he was leaving the conference early, vowing, \\"All that is necessary will be done as soon as possible\\" to help the survivors. The quake was centered about 4 kilometers outside Camposanto, northwest of Bologna, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. In addition to the seven reported fatalities, 50 people were injured in the quake, Gabrielli said. iReport: Watch the earthquake aftermath unfold The stricken region is part of Italy's industrial heartland, and the dead included two people killed in a ceramics factory in Sant'Agostino di Ferrara, about 30 kilometers from the epicenter, civil protection agency spokeswoman Elisabetta Maffani said. Workers were still digging through rubble in hopes of finding survivors in Sant'Agostino, where the quake knocked down a church bell and a magnitude-4.8 aftershock brought down part of its city hall Sunday evening. \\"We have just lost our history. Four generations of my family lived here, and now it's gone,\\" 72-year-old Luciano Frendo said as he walked through Finale Emila. \\"Our history has collapsed.\\" The civil protection agency said it expects to get more reports of injuries as rescue workers make their way to remote villages in the mountainous area. Heavy rain was expected to continue into Tuesday after hampering rescue efforts and efforts to spot survivors from the air. Other deaths included one person killed when a work shed collapsed in nearby Ponte Rodoni di Bondeno, Maffani said. In addition, a woman in Bologna died of a heart attack during an evacuation, a Moroccan national died when the factory he was working in collapsed and a sixth victim was found dead under rubble in Sant'Agostino, she said. The body of a seventh victim was located under a collapsed house, according to Alessio Bellodi of the civil protection branch in Bologna. The same area was struck by a 5.3-magnitude quake in January. And a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the central Italian city of L'Aquila, more than 400 km to the south, in 2009, killing more than 300 and causing widespread destruction. |||||Summary:","completion":"An earthquake happened in northern Italy and it destroyed a lot of cheese, more than 300,000 wheels of cheese.

Pic of escaped prisoner wearing corrections uniform surfaces Published: Thursday, June 11, 2015, 5:20 PM Updated: Thursday, June 11, 2015, 5:52 PM A bizarre photo of escaped killer Richard Matt surfaced Thursday showing him wearing a corrections officer’s uniform shirt and holding a nightstick. “Who said I can’t escape this place!” he wrote in the caption at the bottom of the picture. The disturbing image obtained by Inside Edition was taken in 1986 while Matt was imprisoned at the Elmira Correctional Facility. Matt, who busted out of the Clinton Correctional Facility over the weekend with cop killer David Sweat, mailed it to a retired detective who is now terrified the convict might come after him. \\"I know what you did and I'm not going to forget it,” Matt wrote David Bentley. Bentley, who knew Matt as a kid, was the lead detective who got him convicted for killing and dismembering a former boss — and one of the men responsible for Matt being sent up to the maximum security prison up in Dannemora. Despite that, Matt often sent Bentley letters, including one in 2000 when he predicted he would one day get the death penalty. “I am not scared to die anymore,” he wrote. “I am almost going to welcome death.” Matt, 48, and Sweat, 34, are now the subject of a nationwide manhunt that’s now in its sixth day.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto, when her father (Ken Ogata) would write characters of good fortune on her face. Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt (Hideko Yoshida) reads a list of \\"beautiful things\\" from Sei Shnagon's the book of observations. Nagiko's aunt tells her that when she is twenty-eight years old, the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old, and that she, Nagiko, will be the same age as Sei Shnagon when she had written the book (in addition to sharing her first name).

Q: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Let's analyze the context and break down the details in the original statement: 1. Several nature trails are marked out through the nearby forests: This implies that the area has a number of designated pathways for visitors to explore. The existence of these trails can make it easier for visitors to navigate through the forests while enjoying the natural surroundings. 2. The wealth of wildlife: The reference to the abundance of wildlife indicates that the area is rich in biodiversity. This aspect can significantly add to the overall experience and enjoyment for individuals who are interested in observing animals in their natural habitats. 3.

Solve -524*c + 479*c + 180 = 0 for c.","completion":"To solve the equation -524*c + 479*c + 180 = 0 for c, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the c terms. We have two c terms: -524*c and 479*c. We add them together to simplify the equation: (-524 + 479) * c + 180 = 0 Step 2: Compute the sum. -524 + 479 = -45, so our equation becomes: -45 * c + 180 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the c term. To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term (180) on the left side of the equation. We can accomplish this by subtracting 180 from both sides of the equation: -45 * c + 180 - 180 = 0 - 180 -45 * c = -180 Step 4: Solve for c. Now that we have isolated the c term, we can find the value of c by dividing both sides of the equation by -45: (-45 * c) / -45 = -180 / -45 c = 4 So the solution to the equation -524*c + 479*c + 180 = 0 is c = 4."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - Telugu cinema, also known by its sobriquet Tollywood, is a part of Indian cinema producing films in the Telugu language, based in the Hyderabad neighbourhood of Film Nagar in the Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England. One of Portland's most popular destinations, the popular attraction Portland Bill Lighthouse is found in the area. The surrounding coast of Portland, namely Portland Bill and Chesil Beach, have been notorious for the many vessels that became shipwrecked in the area over the centuries. The dangerous coastline, which features shallow reefs and the Shambles sandbank, was proven more hazardous due to the strong tidal race known as the Portland Race. - Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning. Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \\"clay-mation\\". Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. Stop motion using objects is sometimes referred to as object animation. - Norman Rossington (24 December 1928 21 May 1999) was an English actor best remembered for his roles in \\"The Army Game\\", the \\"Carry On\\" films and the Beatles' film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". - The Adventures of Portland Bill was a British stop motion animated children 's television series made in 1983 . It was set in a fictional lighthouse on the Guillemot Rock , just off the coast from the fictional village of McGuillycuddy . Norman Rossington provided the voice of all the characters , with Portland Bill acting as the narrator of each episode . - Object animation is a form of stop motion animation that involves the animated movements of any non-drawn objects such as toys, blocks, dolls, etc. which are not fully malleable, such as clay or wax, and not designed to look like a recognizable human or animal character. - Children's television series are television programs designed for and marketed to children, normally broadcast programming scheduled for broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake.

The purpose of the shows is mainly to entertain and sometimes to educate. - Chesil Beach , sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain. Its toponym is derived from the Old English \\"ceosel\\" or \\"cisel\\", meaning \\"gravel\\" or \\"shingle\\". - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Clay animation or claymation is one of many forms of stop motion animation.

Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift?

News article: What Silicon Valley Learned From the Kleiner Perkins Case Kleiner Perkins’s victory Friday in the gender discrimination suit brought by Ellen Pao could be seen as an affirmation of the Silicon Valley old boys club. But venture capitalists have said that the trial has already put the tech industry on notice: It can no longer operate as a band of outsiders, often oblivious to rules that govern the modern workplace — even if that has been a key to its success. Silicon Valley has always prided itself on doing business differently. Forget bureaucracy and the traditions of bigger, older companies, the thinking goes. Instead, wear jeans to work, bring your dog, don’t ask permission to try something new, and embrace failure. That nimble approach has helped create more world-changing ideas and wealth than any other industry in recent years. But it can have a flip side — a sometimes blatant disregard for the policies that apply to big businesses, whether it’s obeying regulations, paying taxes or treating employees fairly. The broad themes of the trial extended far beyond Silicon Valley’s casual workplaces. Just as Anita Hill once helped shine a light on overt sexual harassment, Ms. Pao, in suing Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, might have done the same for subtle sexism. The trial was riveting in part because many women could relate to the slights described on the witness stand, like men interrupting women in meetings or assuming they were too preoccupied for a big role because they had children. Studies indicate that a lax approach to gender and diversity issues is worse in an industry dominated by men. Just 6 percent of partners at venture capital firms are women, and 77 percent of firms have never had a female investor. The data show how this affects women, and how a more modern approach to gender dynamics in the workplace could help. In venture capital, a firm invests money from its joint fund, and the partners make investment decisions together. But individuals are responsible for each investment, by finding new start-ups in which to invest and advising them from perches on their boards. Female venture capitalists’ financial performance is about 15 percent lower than that of their male colleagues, according to a study by Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School. The entire difference in performance, the study found, is that women do not benefit from their male colleagues, while men help one another. When there are several female investors at a firm, however, women benefit from their colleagues’ contributions. The performance gap also disappears, the researchers found, in older, larger firms that have formal mentoring, performance reviews and explicit processes for making investment decisions. “For women, at times, it’s, ‘Carry your own water,’ but this is a business that you can learn a lot from people who have been around the block,” Mr. Gompers said. “I don’t think it’s conscious gender discrimination, but I do think in many of these firms, it just happens because our natural tendency is to associate with people who are like us.” Mr. Gompers was a paid witness in Kleiner Perkins’s defense during the trial. The researchers analyzed all venture capital investments from 1975 to 2003, using data from VentureSource. They controlled for characteristics like investors’ education and work experience and the industries in which they invest. Jennifer Fonstad, a founder of Aspect Ventures and former partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, said that the results did not necessarily match her experience, and that the data was probably skewed by the small number of women, the years covered and the difficulty of attributing investments to certain partners. “There are things happening in real time in the field much more quickly than in the data, and there is much more success on the venture side than the data shows,” she said. Still, in surveys with 93 female venture capitalists for the Harvard study, 59 percent said they felt they had been disadvantaged because of their gender. About a third said they received less informal feedback than their male colleagues did, and about a quarter said they had not benefited as much as men from mentorship. They were less likely to go fly fishing or biking with a colleague, or get advice during a casual office chat. But women at larger, older firms or at those with other female investors were less likely to feel disadvantaged, particularly in the area of informal feedback from colleagues. The dynamics, of course, vary by firm. Kleiner Perkins is an older, larger firm. Several people testified in the Pao trial that Kleiner Perkins did not have enough formal policies, including one on sexual harassment, and that women were excluded from informal meetings. Though the study showed the benefits of formal processes, venture firms and start-ups sometimes view these as a waste of time. Small firms often have no human resources employees, and when they do, they are focused almost solely on recruiting. Yet as heretical as it might sound in Silicon Valley, bureaucracy serves a purpose. Studies have found that women generally perform better in companies with more formal processes, and that women in science have better prospects for employment at start-ups that are more bureaucratic. Informal changes can be just as important — and harder to make. These are about being aware of subtle slights and unconscious biases. Does a man notice that he asks only other men to grab a drink after work, or that he interrupts women in meetings? The Kleiner Perkins trial, despite the firm’s victory, already seems to be having an effect. One lesson learned, after Kleiner Perkins emails were read during testimony: Be careful what you write. “The idea that your behavior can be one way internally and another way externally and you can get away with it is evaporating,” a venture capitalist said. “Forwarding around sexist emails, which has happened in our industry and every industry, stopped overnight.” Another venture capitalist said she was making sure her firm had a human resources employee and explicit policies. A third said he was rethinking whether he had turned away female entrepreneurs too quickly in the past. Most would speak only on the condition of anonymity, in part because of the many overlapping business connections. Yet there are also concerns that the trial could have the opposite effect. “I really worry more that there will be a chilling effect on the risk-taking appetite toward getting diversity into venture,” said Peter Fenton, a partner at Benchmark. He said he worried that others might resist hiring a woman because they could think, “Kleiner took the risk and look what happened.” Mr. Fenton, though, said he was pushing for his firm to hire its first female partner. Another investor said he was concerned that the trial might have turned away the next generation of female venture capitalists. If tech companies want to remain a band of risk-taking, fast-moving outsiders, the biggest risk they could take might be hiring more women and then creating company cultures where they can succeed.

It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant. Question: What is a probably cuppa joe? Options: A. not enough information B. A cup of tea. C. A cup of hot cocoa. D. A cup of coffee. === The correct answer is A:","completion":"D. A cup of coffee. A \\"cuppa joe\\" is an informal term for a cup of coffee, originating from the United States. It is believed that the term traces its roots back to the early 20th century when \\"joe\\" was a slang term for a fellow or a guy, which then led to it being used as a colloquial term for the popular beverage. Since then, its usage has become widespread, and a \\"cuppa joe\\" is now widely recognized as referring to a cup of coffee. Food and beverages, such as a cuppa joe, play a significant role in the daily and social lives of people across different cultures. They serve as a conduit for connection, an opportunity for people to come together during a break from their daily routine, and a chance to engage in meaningful exchanges with others. In the context given, the reference to a cuppa joe demonstrates how something as simple as a cup of coffee can hold much more significance than merely providing sustenance. It is a symbol of togetherness, and can act as the focal point around which social interactions are centered. From business meetings to casual catch-ups with friends, a shared \\"cuppa joe\\" (or other food and drink) allows people to bond, build relationships, and create memories. The importance of food in social settings extends beyond casual get-togethers, with meals playing a significant role in formal events, celebrations, and ceremonies. The act of breaking bread together is an ancient and enduring tradition across cultures, signifying trust and goodwill. In many cases, the sharing of food is more than just an enjoyable pastime; it is a crucial means of forging connections and understanding between individuals and communities. Whether offering a simple cup of coffee or hosting an elaborate dinner party, food and drink enable us to communicate in ways that transcend language and cultural barriers. They are intrinsically linked to our expressions of identity, love, and friendship, and create spaces where memories can be made and life can be celebrated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Below, you will find details about each aspect of these replacement tasks. 1. Roof replacement: Roof replacement involves the removal of an existing roof system and installing a new one. It is a crucial task, as the roof is responsible for protecting your home from various external factors, such as rain, wind, and sun. The process of roof replacement includes: - Inspection: Conduct a thorough evaluation of your current roofing system to determine the extent of damage and the need for a full replacement. - Roofing material selection: Choose a suitable roofing material based on your budget, preferences, and climate. Popular choices include asphalt shingles, metal, slate, and clay tiles. - Removal of old roofing system: Remove the existing roof structure, including shingles, underlayment, and other damaged areas. - Installation of new roofing: Install a new roofing system with appropriate underlayment, ventilation, and a layer of new shingles, tiles, or panels, based on your chosen material. - Cleanup and disposal: Properly discard the old roofing material and clean up the worksite. 2. Window replacement: Replacing windows can significantly boost your home's energy efficiency and curb appeal. The steps involved in window replacement are: - Assessment: Evaluate your existing windows to determine if a complete replacement is required or if simple repairs will suffice. - Window style and material selection: Choose a window style, such as double-hung, casement, or sliding, and select a suitable material, such as vinyl, wood, or aluminum. - Measurement: Precisely measure the window opening to ensure a proper fit for the new windows. - Removal of old windows: Carefully remove the old windows while preserving the surrounding structure, if possible. - Installation of new windows: Install the new windows, making sure they are level, plumb, and properly sealed to prevent any air or water infiltration. - Finishing touches: Add trim, caulk, and paint to complete the installation process. 3. Other replacement tasks: Though you asked about roof and window replacement, you also mentioned \\"etc.,\\" which implies there could be other related tasks. These may include: - Siding replacement: Replace damaged or outdated siding with new material, such as vinyl, wood, or fiber cement, to improve your home's appearance and protect it from external elements. - Gutter installation or replacement: New gutters can help better manage rainwater, preventing water damage to your property. - Door replacement: Replace entry and exterior doors to enhance security, thermal efficiency, and appearance. When planning such home improvement endeavors, remember to consider factors like budget, materials, necessary permits, and a professional contractor's services to ensure efficient execution and satisfactory results."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Bipasha Basu (born 7 January 1979), also known by her married name Bipasha Basu Singh Grover, is an Indian film actress and model. Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. One of the judges of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her alongside his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she felt she was too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined. In 2001, Basu finally made her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in Vijay Galani's Ajnabee. The film, directed by Abbas-Mustan, was inspired by the American film Consenting Adults. It was a moderate box-office success and attracted unfavorable reviews from critics. However, Basu's performance in a negative role was appreciated by critics and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In 2002, Basu starred in the year's most successful thriller, Raaz. Directed by Vikram Bhatt, it established Basu in the Hindi film industry. Her portrayal of a woman who is pursued by a spirit received positive reviews. One review in The Tribune noted, \\"... it is Bipasha Basu who steals the show with her fine performance.\\" She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Raaz. She was appreciated in a supporting role in Sanjay Gadhvi's Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a moderate critical and commercial success. However, in David Dhawan's Chor Machaaye Shor, was her first commercial failure. She appeared in a supporting role opposite Mahesh Babu and Lisa Ray in the Telugu film, Takkari Donga.

Is the following review positive or negative? Friend raved about the margaritas here, so we checked out Arriba's for dinner last night. I'd called ahead to ask if Arriba's makes their sour mix from scratch- it does. I also inquired about happy hour-- from 3p to 7p, and reverse HH from 9p to closing, 12 oz. house margaritas are 0.99 each! There's a short list of apps at 50% off, as well. He wanted to try the \\"margarita for two\\" on the rocks, as he's tried the house margarita on previous occasions. Presentation was nice, and it tasted very good- not obnoxiously strong and not cloyingly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw#ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw 7 during happy hour, which I thought was a steal, since the last time I shared a margarita that big (with sister) was at one of the restaurants on the San Antonio's touristy River Walk-- the margarita was 14! Our drink last night had a LOT of ice, though, so we'll have to request for less ice next time, and there will BE a next time. :) Our server also suggested guacamole and chips, or a queso fundido app, so I chose the latter. We both loved the cheese dip, despite the fact that my friend hates tomatoes and there were tomatoes mixed into the fondue. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw#fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw The fondue/fundido also came with a dollop of chorizo. I appreciated its spiciness, but found it too salty. Due to my corn allergy, I requested for fried flour tortilla chips for dipping, and thankfully, the kitchen obliged! Awesome service, so far, which reminds me kudos to our server Chance! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ#F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ Friend didn't enjoy the flour tortilla chips as much as I did, so he asked for regular corn tortilla chips, and again, Chance and kitchen gratified. My friend was going to order the enchiladas, and I told him I was going to try Arriba's pollo con queso. He's had it before, so he decided that we'd just share the entree. Fine by me, since I don't ever finish an entree at the restaurant, anyway. (I always take leftovers home.) The entree was a deep-fried chicken burrito, split three-ways, and smothered with three different cheeses. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA#hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA I don't know what kind of cheeses, and the menu online does not state what they are, but I liked the white variety the best- it's a softer cheese, which equals meltier, creamier, more sensual cheese to me! He liked one of the dark yellow cheeses. Will have to get more info on our next visit. I wonder if I may order this dish with just the one type of cheese? Hmm... further investigation of the menu is needed! ;) My friend doesn't have a sweet tooth, and none of the desserts really caught my eye last night, except perhaps the ones with ice cream; However, Arriba uses Good Humor ice cream, and these contain corn syrup, so I must say no.

Here is an article: The occupation of a federal wildlife refuge near Burns, Ore., took a violent turn on Jan. 26, when a shooting unfolded during a traffic stop. One member of the armed group was killed and eight were arrested, including leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) It's safe to say the news coming out of Oregon -- one man dead, another wounded during an arrest attempt -- is not what the government wanted to happen when a group of armed people took over a wildlife refuge in rural eastern Oregon earlier this month. Despite what some of the armed occupiers allege about government's intentions, in standoffs like these, officials prioritize the safety of everyone involved. One life lost -- on either side -- is one life too many. And there's a reason for that besides the obvious: The protesters feed off the idea of a martyr for the cause. Indeed, they have built their cause by emphasizing that they'll die for it. There are also long-lasting consequences to this violent confrontation that could make current and future anti-government uprisings -- the most recent ones in Nevada in 2014 involving cattle rancher Cliven Bundy and in Oregon this month involving two of Bundy's sons -- more difficult to solve peacefully. The arrest-gone-wrong inflames an already very tense relationship between the government and a small but headstrong group of people who don't respect it or recognize its authority. The standoff sympathizers are already issuing calls for reinforcements for the wildlife refuge they've occupied for for 26 days and counting. In a Facebook post on the Bundy Ranch page, a central communication point for these armed occupiers and their supporters, people circulated a photo of the man who died, LaVoy Finicum, saying he \\"stood for your children's liberty\\" and asking who stands with him and the occupiers. LaVoy has left us, but his sacrifice will never be far from the lips of those who love liberty. You cannot defeat us. Our blood is seed. Posted by Bundy Ranch on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 In short, the movement has a martyr, and the occupation continues, perhaps more determined than ever. [What the armed occupiers really want, in 1 paragraph] \\"This most recent confrontation would probably give them what they believe is further justification and rationale for taking extreme actions,\\" said Bob Abbey, a former head of the Bureau of Land Management, the agency that owns and manages large tracts of land out West and is deeply intertwined with this current standoff. [How the Bundys won in Nevada and what the government needs to do differently in Oregon] Hours after the arrests and confrontation, the government moved to seal off the refuge where the rest of the occupiers remain. Federal agents' presence there will likely make it more difficult for occupier reinforcements to come, although it's also possible their maneuvering could escalate the situation even further. Finicum had told CNN earlier this month he'd rather die than go to jail -- a statement that highlights the level of disdain and disrespect that many of these armed occupiers feel toward the government. We don't know the details of who fired on whom, but it looks like Finicum got his desired outcome. The shots were fired as officials made a move to arrest the occupiers when they were apparently on their way into town to attend a community meeting. Here's the FBI's official statement on it: Almost immediately, armed occupier sympathizers, like controversial Nevada state Assemblywoman Michelle Fiore (R), pointed the finger at the government. Authorities \\"ambushed\\" the occupiers, she said, calling for the shooter to be prosecuted. The play-by-play she shared of what happened has not been confirmed by authorities, and Fiore, whose political career is built on anti-government sentiment, has a vested interest in shaping the narrative against the government. But for the purposes of showing how this incident is being framed by occupation sympathizers as an us-versus-them situation, here's Fiore's full statement: Despite what Fiore alleges, it's fair to say that in this standoff and the Nevada one, the government has taken great pains to avoid this kind of conflict. For proof, look no further than Nevada 2014, where federal agents backed down as a roundup of Cliven Bundy's cattle that had been illegally grazing on federal land turned into an armed standoff with the Bundy family and anti-government supporters who came from as far away as Massachusetts to point guns at federal agents. A Justice Department investigation is ongoing, but more than two years later, charges have yet to be filed. Bundy told me on the standoff's first anniversary that he planned to have a party. In Oregon, authorities attempted to negotiate with the occupiers for the past three weeks. Abbey, who has been critical of how the government handled the Nevada situation, said he thinks authorities did their best to resolve this one peacefully. He doesn't blame the government for trying to arrest the occupiers as they were apparently on their way into town for a community meeting. \\"There comes a time when even patience has to give way to appropriate action,\\" Abbey said. But really, there are few good outcomes in these types of situations. How do you negotiate peacefully with people who don't respect or even recognize the law and are willing to die for their version of it? The best officials could have hoped for was for the occupation to fizzle out, as past ones have. Now, that seems less likely than ever. In fact, this latest turn in the century-long drama between ranchers and the federal government appears to be going in the opposite direction of a long-term solution, Abbey said. \\"If we want true change relating to public lands management,\\" he said, \\"we really do need to put our weapons down and start talking.\\" Given the latest developments in Oregon, that isn't likely to happen anytime soon.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Identify the organization responsible for monetary policy in the United States. 2. Explain the role of the organization in controlling monetary policy. 3. Describe the decision-making process within the organization. Step 1: Identify the organization responsible for monetary policy in the United States. The Federal Reserve System, often referred to as the Fed, is the central banking system of the United States and is responsible for implementing and controlling the nation's monetary policy. Step 2: Explain the role of the organization in controlling monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's primary role in monetary policy is to promote stable prices and maximize employment in the economy. It does this by influencing interest rates, controlling the money supply, and managing inflation. The Fed can use various tools such as open market operations, adjusting the reserve requirements for banks, or modifying the discount rate to influence the financial conditions of the economy. Step 3: Describe the decision-making process within the organization. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — a key component of the Federal Reserve System — is responsible for making decisions related to monetary policy. The FOMC consists of 12 members, including the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and 4 out of the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents who serve rotating terms. The FOMC holds eight scheduled meetings each year and any additional ad-hoc meetings as needed to assess the current economic conditions and make decisions regarding monetary policy adjustments.

Das frühere Suharto-Regime hat in der Vergangenheit über 8 Millionen Indonesier aus überbevölkerten Gebieten in Regionen mit geringer Bevölkerungsdichte umgesiedelt. Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The former Suharto regime has, in the past, relocated over 8 million Indonesians from overpopulated areas to regions with low population density. In addition to providing the translation, here's a more detailed and long explanation about the Suharto regime and the transmigration program in Indonesia. Suharto was the second President of Indonesia, ruling from 1967 to 1998. One of the key policies of his administration was the transmigration program, which aimed to alleviate the issues of overpopulation in heavily populated regions, such as Java, Bali, and Madura, by relocating people to less populated regions like Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. This program was initially introduced during the Dutch colonial era but was expanded significantly under Suharto's regime. The main objective of the transmigration program was to reduce the high population pressure on limited resources in certain areas, provide opportunities for economic development, and promote national integration. The government provided land, housing, tools, and agricultural inputs for the relocated families, helping them establish new lives in these less populated regions. Although the transmigration program had some success in reducing the population density in overpopulated areas and improving the living conditions of the relocated families, it also faced several criticisms and challenges. Some of the issues include: 1. Environmental concerns: The transmigration program led to deforestation, habitat loss, and other environmental issues as lands were cleared for settlements and agriculture. In many cases, this resulted in the depletion of natural resources and loss of biodiversity in the less populated areas. 2. Cultural conflicts: The resettled population often had different cultural and religious practices than the indigenous people in the less populated areas. This sometimes led to interethnic tensions, social conflicts, and even violence between groups. 3. Inequality and lack of land rights: Many indigenous communities, particularly in Papua, were displaced from their ancestral lands due to the transmigration program. This often resulted in land disputes and social inequality as the relocated Indonesian families were provided with facilities, while the indigenous communities were left with inadequate resources and opportunities. The transmigration program was eventually scaled back in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to these issues and financial constraints. However, the legacy of the Suharto regime's policies continues to have an impact on current social, economic, and environmental issues in Indonesia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It had some sort of warmth. We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch. Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth. Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge. Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.

Plot: Eric Jacobs, a well-respected archaeologist, is found dead under mysterious circumstances in the heart of the Mojave Desert. Detective Alex Monroe is assigned to the case and soon discovers that there is more to Jacobs' death than meets the eye. As Monroe delves into Jacobs' past, he uncovers that the deceased archaeologist had recently made a groundbreaking discovery: the long-lost City of Elat, an ancient treasure trove buried deep within the desert's sands. Eric, along with a small team of experts, had been secretly working on excavating the city, unraveling its hidden mysteries, and searching for its legendary cursed treasures. As the investigation deepens, Monroe becomes entwined in a web of deception, betrayal, and hidden dangers. As the detective attempts to solve the murder, he encounters suspicious characters at every turn: an ambitious student with a hidden agenda; a shady fellow archaeologist jealous of Eric's success; and a wealthy businessman who seems to know more about the City of Elat than he should. With each new discovery, the legend of Elat's curse looms larger, as those connected to the case begin to suffer equally mysterious and dangerous accidents. Detective Monroe starts to question whether the ancient curse is fact or superstition as he becomes more and more obsessed with uncovering the truth and protecting the remaining team members. As tensions and stakes rise, Monroe ultimately faces a choice to leave the desert's mysteries undisturbed or risk his own life to uncover Jacobs' killer and the secrets buried beneath the Sands of Solace."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: \\"What city obtained strategic importance after the Byzantine invasion of 554\\" Context: \\"A few centuries later, coinciding with the first waves of the invading Germanic peoples (Suevi, Vandals and Alans, and later the Visigoths) and the power vacuum left by the demise of the Roman imperial administration, the church assumed the reins of power in the city and replaced the old Roman temples with religious buildings. With the Byzantine invasion of the southwestern Iberian peninsula in 554 the city acquired strategic importance. After the expulsion of the Byzantines in 625, Visigothic military contingents were posted there and the ancient Roman amphitheatre was fortified. Little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology, excavations suggest that there was little development of the city. During Visigothic times Valencia was an episcopal See of the Catholic Church, albeit a suffragan diocese subordinate to the archdiocese of Toledo, comprising the ancient Roman province of Carthaginensis in Hispania.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The city that obtained strategic importance after the Byzantine invasion of 554 is Valencia. Located in the southwestern Iberian peninsula, Valencia's strategic importance increased due to its geographical position and the ongoing conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Germanic tribes, such as the Visigoths. After the Byzantines were expelled in 625, the Visigoths fortified the city and posted military contingents there. During this period, the church played a significant role in the governance of Valencia, as the Roman imperial administration had weakened, and Valencia became an episcopal see of the Catholic Church. However, it was a suffragan diocese subordinate to the archdiocese of Toledo, comprising the ancient Roman province of Carthaginensis in Hispania.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Peter Forsberg was born in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden, the son of Kent Forsberg, a former coach of Modo Hockey and the Swedish national team. Forsberg was coached by his father for a significant part of his career: the two teamed up from 1991-94 with Modo and later for the national team in the 1996 World Cup, 1998 Olympics and 1998 World Championship, which Sweden won. Forsberg played minor hockey alongside boyhood friend Markus Naslund, who was also born in Ornskoldsvik. Born ten days apart, the two were well-acquainted while playing on separate youth teams before joining together on the regional Angermanland all-star team for the under-16 TV-pucken national championship in 1988. Forsberg debuted in 1990 with the junior squad of Modo Hockey, the club of his hometown Ornskoldsvik. During the course of the season, he debuted with the senior team that played in the Elitserien, the highest-level professional ice hockey league in Sweden, and scored an assist in his only game. In 1990-91, he scored 102 points in 39 games with the junior team and 17 points in 23 games with the senior team. At the end of the season, Forsberg was drafted sixth overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, the first European player taken that year. The draft pick was surprising because Forsberg was expected to be selected later in the draft. The Hockey News had ranked Forsberg as the 25th best draft prospect in its 1991 draft preview, saying he was \\"a solid second rounder who could move into the first.\\" The pick was criticized by the Philadelphia media, prompting Flyers' General Manager Russ Farwell and the team's chief European scout to reply that time would prove them right. Eric Lindros was the main attraction of the draft. He was drafted first overall by the Quebec Nordiques but refused to sign a contract and, on advice from his mother, began a holdout that lasted over a year. Forsberg was included in a deal that sent five players, two first-round draft picks, and US15 million to the Quebec Nordiques in exchange for Lindros. In hindsight, the Lindros trade is seen as one of the most one-sided deals in sports history, and the deal became a major foundation for the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise's success over the next decade. Forsberg remained in Sweden, playing for Modo for the following three years. In 1993, the team was eliminated in the playoffs quarterfinals against Malmo, and Forsberg won the Guldpucken for Player of the Year and the Guldhjalmen for Most Valuable Player of the Elitserien, an award decided by the players. He won both prizes again in 1994, when, after barely making the playoffs, he led his team to their first final since winning the Elitserien playoffs in 1979. In a five-game series again against Malmo, Forsberg scored in overtime in game two to put his team one win away from the title. However, he suffered from the flu,(influenza v) and Modo lost the remaining games of the series and the title. By this point, Forsberg was thought to be the best player in the world outside the NHL. During the summer of 1994, Forsberg decided to play in the NHL after he signed a contract with the Quebec Nordiques in October 1993. The contract was a four-year deal worth 6.5 million, including 4.275 million given as a signing bonus. However, a lockout delayed his NHL debut until 1995, and Forsberg returned to Modo to play 11 more games before going back to North America. Did he play well for the Flyers?","completion":"Forsberg never actually played for the Philadelphia Flyers.

A food lover's guide to the borough's top restaurants Sunday, October 23th 2005, 2:13AM The Yankees may not have come through this year but the Bronx still has a lot to cheer about: The new Zagat restaurant guide bumped up the borough, doubling its 2006 listings to 25 spots. That's delicious news to Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion - a former caterer - who spent the past year loudly urging his neighbors to vote for local favorites (the guide is compiled from online surveys). Still, he's not stopping his dining drive. \\"There are far many more,\\" says Carrion of undiscovered Bronx restaurants he feels should make Zagat's list. In 2007, he'll try to double the numbers again, adding not just Arthur Avenue Italian or City Island seafood, but the best of the West African, Asian, Caribbean, Albanian and Latin American cafes that share so many Bronx thoroughfares. Tim Zagat, the guide's founder, will be waiting: \\"I think there are more restaurants in the Bronx,\\" he told the Daily News last week. \\"It's high on our radar screen.\\" So, for all those ready to help the cause - and eat well - here are 10 of our Bronx favorites: five that were in this year's Â­Zagat guide and five, with luck, that will make it into the next one. 1. BRUCKNER BAR AND GRILL Travelers on the FDR may have spotted this South Bronx gastropub's chic neon sign, signaling the fledgling artists' nabe they're calling SoBro. While the rest of the area has a ways to go, the burgers, guacamole and vibe at this stylish corner spot are already winners. 1 Bruckner Blvd., near the Third Ave. Bridge, (718) 665-2001 Gourmet pizza may have blanketed the city like fresh mozzarella, but this Morris Park spot is still worth a trip: It's one of the few city shops grilling their pies. The pizzas (and paninis) are crispy thin, perfectly charred and gone in a second. Toppings, everything from fontina to smoked provolone and Nutella, change frequently. 1888 Eastchester Road, at Morris Park Ave., (718) 823-7002 Tucked into a bustling shopping street just west of Bronx Park, this tiny Albanian shop specializes in bureks - those round, flaky pies stuffed with savory beef, spinach or soft creamy cheese. Once you try a giant 3 wedge topped with tangy homemade yogurt, you'll see why they're a southeastern European favorite. 758 Lydig Ave., between Holland and Wallace Aves., (718) 822-8955 4. EL MOLINO ROJO II Just across from the Bronx courthouse and Yankee Stadium, this Puerto Rican standby touts its cuchifritos - golden fried Puerto Rican snacks. They're great here, as are the soups, but definitely don't miss the roast pork. 101 E. 161st St., at Walton Ave., (718) 538-9642 Another fave for courthouse employees, this Caribbean cafe is known for topnotch jerk pork, curry goat and oxtail. (If you think you don't like it, says boro prez Carrion, this place will change your mind.) You can get your Jamaican patty and fresh juice fix here, too, at the takeout shop next door. 892 Gerard Ave., at E. 162nd St., (718) 293-5025 Not much has changed at this old-school seafood cafeteria on the very tip of City Island, where masses line up for a 10 pile of freshly fried clams and fries. There's a full bar and a vast patio where you can gaze at the Throgs Neck Bridge (and break the rules by tossing your fries to the friendly seagulls). 2 City Island Ave., at the water, (718) 885-2086. 7. LE REFUGE INN zagat food 25* Just up the road from Johnny's is a decidedly different dining experience. This Zagat-ranked bed-and-breakfast offers fine French dining (canard Ã l'orange, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e) in a renovated Victorian mansion. Stay the night and check out the morning sea breeze with croissants. 586 City Island Ave., between Beach and Cross Sts., (718) 885-2478 8. MADISON'S zagat food 21 One of the first sophisticated (yet affordable) restaurants to open in the beautiful north Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale, the Zagat-rated Madison's was quickly successful. Regulars still praise its mix of well-crafted American standards, from pastas to steaks and salads. 5686 Riverdale Ave., at 259th St. (718) 543-3850 9. RIVERDALE GARDEN zagat food 22 A labor of love from Michael and Lisa Sherman, this seasonally adaptive bistro has an ever-changing menu and a locally renowned deck overlooking the backyard garden. Enjoy it while you can with dishes like Long Island duck with wild rice or pan-roasted chicken with greens and sage-cheese grits. 4576 Manhattan College Parkway, near Broadway, (718) 884-5232 10. ROBERTO'S zagat food 27 This classic red sauce Italian - just off Arthur Ave. - is a perennial citywide favorite, earning the highest Zagat rankings for food and popularity and the No. 2 spot for Italian overall. (And while you're there, don't miss the food shops and overstuffed sandwiches in the Arthur Avenue Market around the corner.) 603 Crescent Ave., at Hughes Ave., (718) 733-9503 * Zagat food rating out of possible 30 What was this article about?","completion":"This article, published on October 23, 2005, provides a guide to the top restaurants in the Bronx, New York City.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \\"deeply moved\\", and \\"at once saddened and ashamed\\" that he could not accept it.

Given the question: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. Two regions, region A and region B, shared a common border, a river. Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. Which region had more sulfate reduction? The answer is:","completion":"Region A had more sulfate reduction. There are a few reasons why Region A had more sulfate reduction than Region B. First, let's understand the main characteristics of the bacteria present in both regions and the environmental factors that affect their growth. Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) obtain their energy by reducing sulfate (SO4) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in anaerobic conditions. They use organic compounds such as lactate, acetate, and other simple organic molecules as electron donors. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, on the other hand, are capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3) using the enzyme nitrogenase. This process is essential for the biosynthesis of amino acids, proteins, and other nitrogen-containing compounds. In contrast, Region B was more favorable for the development of non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. Non-respiratory anaerobes rely on fermentation to generate energy, employing organic molecules as their terminal electron acceptor instead of utilizing external electron acceptors like oxygen or sulfate. As a result, they produce metabolic waste by-products such as ethanol, lactic acid, and hydrogen gas. Facultative anaerobes are microorganisms that possess the ability to switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors, depending on the oxygen availability in their environment. When oxygen is present, they use it as their terminal electron acceptor, while under anaerobic conditions, they can switch to other acceptors or rely on fermentation. Given the distinct bacterial composition in each region, it is evident that Region A had more sulfate reduction due to its favorable environment and the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. These bacteria thrive in anaerobic, sulfate-rich conditions, such as those in sediments, waterlogged soils, or other reducing environments. In contrast, Region B's bacterial composition mainly consists of non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes, which do not primarily rely on sulfate reduction for energy generation. While facultative anaerobes can switch to sulfate reduction under certain conditions, their specialist counterparts in Region A significantly contribute to higher sulfate reduction rates. In conclusion, Region A, with its suitable conditions and higher concentration of sulfate-reducing bacteria, experienced more sulfate reduction than Region B, where non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes dominated the bacterial composition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When you’re stressed, your cortisol levels can skyrocket, leading to more fat storage in your midsection. To avoid this, make time for activities that help relieve your stress. Reading, playing an instrument, or hitting the golf course, for example, are all great options for stress-relieving activities. Sleep has a huge impact on your ability to fight belly fat. When you don’t get enough sleep, you likely have a harder time controlling your appetite, cravings, mood, and motivation. By getting enough sleep, you’ll have the energy to stay motivated to stick to your diet and exercise plan and get rid of your muffin top. Getting enough sleep also helps keep your cortisol levels down, which helps fight belly fat by helping your body manage stress. Sleeping also helps decrease late night snacking, which can derail your progress and contribute to muffin top. When you add muscle mass and lose belly fat, the number on the scale may stay the same or even increase. Instead of relying on your weight to track your progress, take time to assess how you feel and how your clothes fit. This will be a much more accurate indicator of whether your muffin top is shrinking or not. While losing belly fat can make you feel better and help your clothes fit better, it can also play a big role in improving your health. Having excess belly fat can increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease.

Article: In 1995,Oseola McCarty gave a present of 150 000 to the University of Southern Mississippi. She wanted to help poor students. It was a very generous thing to do. But her friends and neighbors were surprised. McCarty was a good woman. She went to church. She was always friendly and helpful. But everyone in her town knew that McCarty was not rich. In fact,she was poor. How did a poor 86-year-old woman have so much money? Oseola McCarty was born in 1908 in Hattiesburg,Mississippi. She had to leave school when she was eight years old to help her family. She took a job washing clothes. She earned only a few dollars a day. Oseola washed the clothes by hand. Then she hung the clothes to dry. She did this for nearly 80 years. In the 1960s,she bought an automatic washer and dryer. But she gave them away. She did not think they got the clothes clean enough!At that time,many people started to buy their own washers and dryers. McCarty did not have much work, so she started to iron clothes instead. McCarty never married or had children. Her life was very simple. She went to work and to church. She read her Bible . She had a black-and-white television. But she did not watch it very much. It had only one channel. McCarty saved money all her life and eventually had about 250 000. When she was 86,a lawyer helped her make a will. She left money to the church,her relatives,and the university. McCarty just wanted to help others. She did not think she was a special person. But then people found out about her present to the university. She received many honors . She even flew in an airplane for the first time!Oseola McCarty died in 1999. She was a shy and ordinary woman who became famous. ,. Question: From the story we know _ . Options: A: McCarty was born in a poor family near the University of Southern Mississippi B: everyone was surprised because they thought McCarty had no education C: washers and dryers brought a change in McCarty's life D: McCarty gave half of her money to the church and her relatives A:","completion":"A: Based on the story provided, the correct answer would be A: McCarty was born in a poor family near the University of Southern Mississippi. Justification for the answer: The story tells us that Oseola McCarty was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi in 1908. She had to leave school when she was eight years old to help her family, indicating that she came from a financially struggling environment. Additionally, Hattiesburg is close to the University of Southern Mississippi. Thus, the statement in A fits perfectly with the details provided in the story. Let's evaluate other options. B: The story does mention that McCarty had to drop out of school at a young age, but her donating a large sum to the university was the cause of surprise, not solely her lack of formal education. Therefore, option B is partially correct but does not encapsulate the surprise factor properly. C: According to the story, McCarty did buy washers and dyers in the 1960s, but she didn't find them effective enough and gave them away. This indicates that the introduction of these appliances didn't bring significant change to McCarty's hand washing routine. D: The story mentions that McCarty left money to the church, her relatives, and the university in her will. However, it doesn't specify that she donated half of her money to the church and her relatives. Therefore, this option cannot be confirmed from the information provided in the story. Ironically, McCarty, born in a poor family, initially washed clothes to help her family, and later to earn a living. Despite the hardship, she managed to save about 250,000 throughout her life. Her story has been described as inspiring, as it illustrates how frugal living and long term saving can accumulate significant wealth, even from a little earning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: This will allow at the salt and sugar to become evenly distributed throughout the flour. If you do not have a food processor, then put everything into a bowl and stir it briskly with a fork. You can also use plain flour instead of all-purpose flour. Start with ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of water; you will be adding the rest later, depending on how dry the dough is. Most food processors should have a spout at the top where you can pour ingredients through without taking the lid off. After a while, the dough should start to come away from the sides of the food processor. If the dough is still too dry and has floury clumps in it, add the rest of the water, one tablespoon at a time. Do this until the dough clumps together and comes away from the walls of the food processor. If you do not have a food processor, make a hole in the middle of your flour mixture, and pour the lemon juice and water in. Stir it with a fork until the dough clumps together. The lemon juice will help make the dough more elastic and easier to roll out. You won't taste it once you bake the pastry. The square should measure 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) on each side. Do not make the square too thin. This will make the dough easier to work with later. During this time, you can start preparing the butter. Make sure that the butter sticks are touching each other and that the flour is spread evenly across them. Keep doing this until the flour becomes ingrained in the butter. Once you are done mashing, remove the top parchment sheet. The square should measure 8 inches (20.30 centimeters) on each side. Leave it there for one hour. This will allow the butter to cool back down and become more manageable later. You want to end up with a square that it is about 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) on each side. Unwrap the butter and position it so that the corners are touching the flat sides of the dough square. Then, lift the corners of the dough and fold them towards the middle of the butter, creating a square-shaped packet. Do not make it too thin, and make sure that the rectangle is three times longer than it is wide. Life the bottom third up and bring it just past the middle of the rectangle. Press it down. Next, lift the top third and bring it down onto the rest of the dough, creating a square. You can turn it to the left or right. If the packet does not turn easily, the dough likely soaked up the flour. Gently lift the packet up and spread a thin layer of flour onto your work surface. Set the packet back down and try turning it again. Roll the dough out into a rectangle and fold it into thirds again. You are doing this to create thin layers of dough and butter. Let it there until it becomes firm; it should take about 20 minutes depending on how cold your fridge is. After you roll, fold, and rotate the dough two times, put it into the fridge for 20 minutes, then roll, fold, and turn it two more times. At this point, you can start using your dough in your recipe.","completion":"The text describes the process of making a pastry dough with or without a food processor. The ingredients, such as flour (plain or all-purpose), salt, sugar, and water are combined to create a malleable dough. If needed, water can be gradually added to reduce dryness.

The dough along with butter is then folded to make a square-shaped packet. It is advised to keep the dough not too thin and make sure it is three times longer than it is wide.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the names of the two towns that have become known as Weymouth? ? Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower. The architect Sir Christopher Wren was the Member of Parliament for Weymouth in 1702, and controlled nearby Portland's quarries from 1675 to 1717.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Tak'alik Ab'aj first started to flourish in the Preclassic period, around the 9th century BC."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This overlong, narcissistic, self-relecting, but astonishing and frequently funny film follows a fictional NASCAR racing driver, a psychologically damaged manchild named Ricky Bobby, who lives his life according to the adage that \\"If you're not number one, you're last.\\" This ideology causes problems with his best friend and co-racer (Cal Naughton, Jr., played by the wickedly talented John C.

Article: Although Americans are well known for getting down to business, Indians working in overseas teams, MNCs, and BPOs should know the importance of small talk. While Indians have a true interest in talking to Americans and getting to know them, they also hesitate to do so for some reasons. Americans engage in less personal small talk than Indians. And the topics and questions used in English vary widely based on language differences and cultural differences. Here are three things to keep in mind while you are trying to make small talk with your American clients and colleagues. Amencans love to ask about, and then complain about the weather. They may talk about how the weather prevented them from having fun or how the weather supported their outdoor events. You can talk about the weather with them to begin a conversation. While talking, they always try to follow up on their answer by asking another open-ended question or make a statement, such as \\"Wow, that sounds like fun ! \\" or \\"You went to St. Louis. In which state is that?\\" Be creative in your questions. Feel free to ask one or two, but not very personal ones about relations. Stick to the facts or events that were already referred to. Sometimes, some words used in India will totally confuse an American. For example, Americans use the word \\"weekend\\" instead of \\"holiday\\" for Saturdays and Sundays ( non-working days) , and use the word \\" vacation\\" or \\" days off\\" instead of \\" out-of-station\\" . Always be interested, optimistic and happy. Talk with a smile! Vary the sound of your voice. Do not sound like a computer. If you are unsure how you sound, a good tip is to record yourself and listen to it later. Doing this helps you know how your voice sounds, and if you don't sound as you want to be heard, it may be time to work on _ your voice. Question: What's the writer's purpose in writing the passage?

Specifically, the member is worried about the possibility of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec increasing its stake in Air Canada to such an extent that it could potentially gain control over the company. From this standpoint, it seems that the member is taking a stance that goes against the broader direction of his own party. However, it is essential to consider the broader context and motivations behind this disagreement before concluding that this person is 'fighting' against his party members. First, it is important to recognize that a diversity of opinions and perspectives is to be expected within a political party.

These differences can arise from the unique backgrounds, experiences, and values of party members or their constituents. Second, it is possible that the member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges is motivated by concerns for the broader public interest or the interests of his constituents. He may believe that an increase in the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec's stake in Air Canada could have negative implications for the company's operations, employees, or travelers.

Sentence 1: When Inglis vows to serve only two Senate terms, Hollings crows about his experience. This sentence tells us two things: 1) Inglis is vowing to serve only two Senate terms. 2) Hollings is talking about his experience in response to Inglis' vow. Sentence 2: Hollings' experience undermines Inglis' vow to only serve two Senate terms. This sentence suggests that Hollings' experience somehow negates or weakens Inglis' vow to serve only two Senate terms. Now, let's see if the second sentence is true given that the first sentence is true. Based on Sentence 1, we know that Inglis is making a vow, and Hollings is discussing his experience. However, this information doesn't necessarily imply that Hollings' experience is undermining Inglis' vow. We do not have enough information about the nature of Hollings' remarks or how they might affect Inglis' vow.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"Predicting the sentiment of this tweet is a multifaceted process, as it requires understanding the various aspects of the language used, context, and tone. To understand the sentiment, it is essential to break down the tweet into different components and analyze them individually. Then, we can infer the underlying sentiment by considering the combined meaning and addressing potential misleading components due to sarcasm or irony. The tweet starts with the phrase \\"it's raining men!!!\\" which is an idiom originally from the 1982 song by The Weather Girls. Typically, it represents a positive sentiment, as it denotes a large number of attractive men in a particular location. When using this phrase, people might express excitement, joy, or eagerness. However, it is important to consider the rest of the tweet to discern the sentiment in this specific situation. Continuing with the tweet, the phrase \\"I wish\\" indicates that the author desires something different. In this context, the wish refers to \\"it's just raining...and a lot at that...\\" which implies that instead of raining men, the author would prefer that it is actually raining. By breaking down this part of the tweet, we can observe a longing for the natural occurrence of rainfall. Considering the tweet as a whole, the sentiment can be identified as a mix of humor, sarcasm, and appreciation of the rain. The author has used a well-known idiom to express their true desire for it to rain, with a sarcastic twist. In general, the sentiment of this tweet can be classified as light-hearted and playful, using humor to communicate a specific preference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories. Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After some time passes, he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and chosen an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about Mac and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott (Betty Buckley), a country music star who is performing nearby. After the story is printed, the neighborhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local countryâwestern band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).

Input: Image copyright Spl Image caption The association between genes and violence was strongest for repeat violent offenders A genetic analysis of almost 900 offenders in Finland has revealed two genes associated with violent crime. Those with the genes were 13 times more likely to have a history of repeated violent behaviour. The authors of the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, said at least 5-10% of all violent crime in Finland could be attributed to individuals with these genotypes. But they stressed the genes could not be used to screen criminals. Many more genes may be involved in violent behaviour and environmental factors are also known to have a fundamental role. Even if an individual has a \\"high-risk combination\\" of these genes the majority will never commit a crime, the lead author of the work Jari Tiihonen of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden said. \\"Committing a severe, violent crime is extremely rare in the general population. So even though the relative risk would be increased, the absolute risk is very low,\\" he told the BBC. We're all products of genetics and the environment but I don't think that robs us of free will or understanding right and wrong Dr Christopher Ferguson, Stetson University, Florida The study, which involved analysis of almost 900 criminals, is the first to have looked at the genetic make-up of so many violent criminals in this way. Warrior gene Each criminal was given a profile based on their offences, categorising them into violent or non-violent. The association between genes and previous behaviour was strongest for the 78 who fitted the \\"extremely violent offender\\" profile. This group had committed a total of 1,154 murders, manslaughters, attempted homicides or batteries. A replication group of 114 criminals had all committed at least one murder. These all carried a low-activity version of the MAOA gene, which previous research has dubbed the \\"warrior gene\\" because of its link to aggressive behaviour. Crime genes The two genes associated with violent repeat offenders were the MAOA gene and a variant of cadherin 13 (CDH13) The MAOA gene codes for the enzyme monoamine oxidase A, which is important for controlling the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the brain CDH13 has previously been associated with substance abuse and ADHD Those classified as non-violent offenders did not have this genetic profile A deficiency of the enzyme this controls could result in \\"dopamine hyperactivity\\" especially when an individual drinks alcohol or takes drugs such as amphetamines, said Prof Tiihonen. The majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime in Finland do so under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Free will For now, a person's genetic information should not have any influence on conviction outcomes in criminal courts, Prof Tiihonen added. \\"There are many things which can contribute to a person's mental capacity. The only thing that matters is the mental capacity of the individual to understand the consequences of what he or she is doing and whether or not the individual can control his or her own behaviour.\\" Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University in the US state of Florida agreed. He said it must be remembered that there was not \\"one or even two genes that by themselves code for violence or crime\\". \\"To some extent we're all products of genetics and the environment but I don't think that robs us of free will or understanding right and wrong.\\" Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Researchers say genetic profiling should not yet be used in criminal courts Despite this view, echoed by many other scientists, there have been several instances of defence lawyers using genetic information to reduce sentences. In 2009, a court in Italy reduced the sentence of a criminal with genes linked to bad behaviour. In a similar case in the US a murderer's genetic profile was highlighted as a contributing factor for his crime. Commenting on the latest study, Dr Ferguson said it added to our understanding of the factors involved in violent crime. \\"Studies like this really document that a large percentage of our behaviour in terms of violence or aggression is influenced by our biology - our genes - and our brain anatomy. \\"It's important to conceptualise crime and violence, where it comes from, even if we would not want to radically change the criminal justice system.\\" Brett Haberstick from the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US, said the work illustrates that \\"finding genes for criminal behaviour is going to be difficult\\", despite a long tradition of biological work in the area of criminology. He said it would be important for others with similar data to replicate the study. \\"It is worthwhile to look for biological contributions to criminal or antisocial behaviour as their impact on individuals, communities and society in general is sizeable. What I think, however, is that it is vital that environmental influences are considered as well,\\" he told BBC News. Jan Schnupp at the University of Oxford was critical of the work. He commented that up to half the population could have one of the genes involved. \\"To call these alleles 'genes for violence' would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime.\\" Follow Melissa on twitter ||||| A new genetic study linking two genes to extreme violent behavior is raising serious questions as to what makes a criminal and whether or not these genes could be used to screen — or even let off — potential offenders. A Karolinska Institute research team led by Jari Tihonen found that prisoners in Finland with mutated forms of the two genes — the MAOA gene (sometimes called the \\"warrior gene\\") and a variant of cadherin 13 (CDH13) — were 13 times more likely to have a history of repeated violent behavior. According to the study, which now appears in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, at least 5 to 10% of all violent crime in Finland is attributable to individuals with this particular genetic profile. That's obviously quite significant, but there's more to it than that. \\"Substantially Higher Frequency\\" For the study — the largest of its kind to date — nearly 900 Finns imprisoned for both violent and non-violent crimes underwent a genetic analysis. Each criminal was assigned a profile based on the nature of their offences. In all, the group committed a total of 1,154 murders, manslaughters, attempted homicides, or batteries. A replication group consisting of 114 criminals was also studied. After comparing the genetic profiles of these offenders to those in the general population, the researches found a \\"substantially higher frequency\\" of the implicated genes in violent offenders. What's more, \\"No substantial signal was observed for either MAOA or CDH13 among non-violent offenders, indicating that findings were specific for violent offending,\\" noted the researchers in the study. The scientists also considered environmental factors, like whether or not people had a history of substance abuse, antisocial personality disorders, or childhood maltreatment. But these co-factors, say the researchers, did not alter the outcome. Rather Common Importantly, the study wasn't designed to explain the association. In fact, the scientists involved in the study are quite certain many other genetic variants play a role — either directly or indirectly — in the cognitive molecular cascade that's known to influence behavior. Moreover, the two mutated gene versions are \\"rather common.\\" In fact, as many as one in five people have them — the vast majority of whom never commit extreme violent crimes such as rape, assault, or murder. At the same time, people without the variants were also found in the ultra-violent trial group. \\"Although the high-risk genotype combination of MAOA and CDH13 has a risk of about 13-fold compared with the 'usual' genotype combination, still the vast majority (of) high-risk genotype individuals do not commit severe violent crimes,\\" noted Tihonen in an AFP article. The Molecules of Hate As noted, other genes may be responsible for violent behavior, and despite screening for environmental factors, it's a safe bet that social and economic factors play a non-trivial role in facilitating violent behavior. That said, given the association, it's important to look at the two genetic variants to see how a person's brain could be primed for such behavior. The MAOA gene is linked to the metabolism of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter that's known to play a role in addiction and the ability to experience pleasure. A deficiency in this enzyme results in \\"dopamine hyperactivity\\", which is pronounced when a person drinks alcohol or takes drugs. And in fact, the majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime in Finland were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As for CDH13, it's thought to be involved impulse control. It may also play a role in ADHD. A Finding That Can't Be Taken Too Far Tihonen agrees that a person's genetic information should not have any bearing on conviction outcomes in criminal courts. Speaking to the BBC he added: There are many things which can contribute to a person's mental capacity. The only thing that matters is the mental capacity of the individual to understand the consequences of what he or she is doing and whether or not the individual can control his or her own behaviour. Indeed, these two genes aren't hindering an individual's capacity to function as a responsible individual in the real world, or to impair their ability to discern right from wrong. That said, some courts are reducing sentences of criminals with genes linked to bad behavior. For better or worse, studies like these are poised to change the way criminals are sentenced and how we assess accountability. Read the entire study at Molecular Psychiatry: \\"Genetic background of extreme violent behavior\\". Supplementary sources: AFP | BBC ||||| Two separate genetic traits have been linked to violent crime in a study that raises the possibility of there being an innate, biological basis for serious criminality. Scientists in Finland said that between five and 10 per cent of severe violent crime in the Scandinavian country could be attributable to both sets of genes, each of which can modify the activity of the brain. The findings are not the first to link criminal tendencies to genes and they have already generated critical comments from other experts who point to the limitations of the work and the complexity of human behaviour. However, Professor Jan Tiihonen of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who led the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, said that there is mounting scientific evidence pointing to the influence of genes on violent criminality. “One way of putting it is that if these two genes did not exist, there might be between five and 10 per cent less violent crime in Finland, but we cannot be sure of what the mechanism is that causes this,” Professor Tiihonen told The Independent. “We’ve observed two genes that have a relatively big effect on violent behaviour but there are possibly tens or hundreds of other genes that have a smaller effect. This is why a ‘test for criminality’ is not possible from this study,” he said. The study analysed the genomes of 895 offenders in Finnish prisons and found that a variant of a gene for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme in the brain that “mops up” the neurotransmitter dopamine, was significantly more prevalent in the most violent criminals who had committed 10 or more serious offenses compared to the rest of the population. About 60 per cent of these repeat offenders carried the low-activity version of the gene, compared to a prevalence of 40 per cent in the general population. Professor Tiihonen said this suggests the gene plays a role in determining or controlling extremely violent behaviour. A second gene, called cadherin 13 (CDH13), which is involved in communication between brain cells and has already been linked to the control of impulsive behaviour, was also found to be linked with extreme criminal violence. “A conservative estimate implies that five to 10 per cent of all severe violent crime in Finland is attributable to specific MAOA and CDH13 genotypes,” the study concludes. A study published in 2002 on more than 400 men found that boys who inherited the low activity version of the MAOA gene and who were subjected to childhood abuse were twice as likely as non-abused carriers of the gene to become violent criminals. However, Professor Tiihonen said that the Finnish study was unable to establish whether there was a similar interaction between upbringing and genetic inheritance, although clearly 40 per cent of people with the gene variant did not become violent criminals. “When interpreting these results it is very important to put them in the right perspective,” said Jan Schnupp, professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study. “The thing that should be mentioned again and again is that half the population have low-activity MAOA enzymes, but only a tiny fraction of these carriers end up behind bars for violent crimes,” Professor Schupp said. “To call these ‘genes for violence’ would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime,” he said. Malcolm von Schantz, a molecular neuroscientist at Surrey University, said that the findings do not suggest that a genetic explanation will replace the concept of free will and criminal responsibility for a person’s behaviour. “But I think findings such as these may make it possible, in future, to screen people with vulnerable backgrounds and identify those who are at greater risk of becoming offenders, so that they can get appropriate help before they commit any serious violent crimes,” Dr von Schantz said. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices.

Please answer this question: where is the story of joseph in the bible found?","completion":"The story of Joseph is found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) within the book of Genesis, specifically from chapters 37 to 50. The narrative provides a detailed account of Joseph's life, beginning with his birth and early years, his sale into slavery, his rise to prominence in Egypt, and culminating in his reconciliation with his family. Joseph is introduced in Genesis 37 as the favored son of Jacob, born to his father's beloved wife, Rachel. He was gifted with a special ability to interpret dreams, which led to his father bestowing upon him a \\"coat of many colors.\\" Joseph's brothers, however, were envious of Joseph's special status and their father's favoritism. This envy amplified when Joseph shared two dreams he had, in which his brothers would eventually bow down to him. Out of jealousy, Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery to a group of Midianite merchants, who then took him to Egypt. After being sold, Joseph became a servant to a high-ranking Egyptian officer named Potipar. Joseph proved himself to be a trusted and capable servant, gaining Potipar's favor as he was placed in charge of the entire household. Unfortunately, Joseph faced a major obstacle when Potipar's wife falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. As a result, he was thrown into prison. While in prison, Joseph continued to demonstrate his gift for dream interpretation by correctly interpreting the dreams of two fellow prisoners: a cupbearer and a baker. Both dreams served as prophetic, accurately predicting the prisoners' futures. Later, when the Pharaoh of Egypt experienced two troubling dreams that no one could interpret, the cupbearer (who had been released from prison) remembered Joseph's ability and recommended him to the Pharaoh. Joseph interpreted the Pharaoh's dreams, which revealed that Egypt would face seven years of abundant harvest followed by seven years of severe famine. Impressed by Joseph's wisdom, the Pharaoh appointed him as the highest ranking official in the Egyptian government and his personal advisor. Joseph's role was to manage the collection, storage, and distribution of grain throughout Egypt during the years of abundance to prepare for the coming famine. When the famine arrived, it affected not only Egypt, but also the surrounding regions, including the land of Canaan where Joseph's family lived. Joseph's brothers traveled to Egypt in search of food without realizing that their brother was now the overseer of the country's grain supply. Through a series of encounters, Joseph tested his brothers' loyalty, eventually revealing his true identity to them. Their reunion was emotional, with Joseph forgiving his brothers for their past mistakes and inviting them to bring the entire family to live in Egypt under his care and protection. This resulted in the migration of Joseph's father, Jacob, and the entire family to Egypt, where they were reunited and settled in the land of Goshen. Joseph's story concludes in Genesis 50, when he dies at the age of 110, after witnessing the birth of his great-grandchildren. Joseph's journey from his early life as a favored son to being sold into slavery, rising to power in Egypt, and eventually reconciling with his family symbolizes themes of forgiveness, humility, and God's redemptive plan throughout the Bible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton (; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold 3 million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records. Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million, which sold 3 million copies in the United States and more than 8 million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \\"Try Again\\". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this goal. \\"Try Again\\" also earned Aaliyah a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. After completing Romeo Must Die, Aaliyah filmed her role in Queen of the Damned, and released her self-titled third and final studio album in 2001. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in the Bahamas after filming the music video for the single \\"Rock the Boat\\".

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose double triumph in piano and voice resulted in being awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival? ? In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps,...

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process. In an anaerobic environment, oxygen is scarce or non-existent. As a result, the body needs to adapt its metabolic processes to survive. When oxygen is scarce, cells in the body resort to an anaerobic (without oxygen) process to break down glucose and produce energy, also known as anaerobic respiration or fermentation. This process is less efficient and produces lactic acid as a byproduct instead of carbon dioxide. This means that the body would need to break down more glucose to produce the same amount of energy it would produce under normal oxygen conditions.

In Romanian language nouns are usually used with articles (definite or indefinite) attached to them. Because \\"future\\" refers to a specific future (the future of the union), we use the definitive article. Thus, \\"the future\\" translates as \\"viitorul\\". 2. \\"of the Union\\" is translated as \\"Uniunii\\". In Romanian, the preposition \\"of\\" is often conveyed through the use of the genitive case, which indicates possession. Therefore, the genitive case of \\"Uniune\\" (Union in Romanian) is \\"Uniunii\\". 3. The word \\"is\\" would be translated as \\"este\\". 4. \\"currently\\" translates to \\"în acest moment\\" in Romanian. It could also be translated as \\"momentan\\" or \\"curent\\", but \\"în acest moment\\" is a more formal way to express this concept, which fits with the tone of the sentence. 5. Finally, \\"in the balance\\" translates to \\"în echilibru\\". The phrase \\"in the balance\\" is an idiomatic expression in English. It refers to a situation where an outcome is uncertain and could go either way. The closest equivalent in Romanian would be the term \\"în echilibru\\".

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process in the life cycle of a butterfly is the laying of eggs by the female butterfly. This process is crucial to the continuation of the species and reproduction. The female butterfly starts by searching for a suitable host plant, usually a specific type of plant that is compatible with the needs of the larvae, predominantly regarding available food. Upon finding an appropriate host plant, the female butterfly inspects it to ensure its quality and suitability before proceeding to lay her eggs. Usually, the eggs are laid individually or in clusters, depending on the species of the butterfly. The eggs are small and come in various shapes and colors, such as spherical, conical, or cylindrical. They possess a hard exterior, known as the chorion, that provides protection from external threats. The eggs also have tiny openings called micropyles, which facilitate the entry of sperm during the fertilization process. Once the eggs are laid, the developmental and maturation process starts as the future larvae or caterpillars begin to form inside the eggs. This process is known as embryogenesis and lasts anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the specific butterfly species and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. In summary, the first step in the life cycle of a butterfly is the female butterfly laying eggs on a suitable host plant. This initial phase sets the stage for the entire metamorphosis journey – from egg to larva, pupa, and ultimately, adult butterfly. The process is a delicate and intricate one, showcasing the marvels of nature and the complexities of species survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is roughly the same story told a few different ways, and the outcome is obvious from the beginning. The usual villain appears in each book, and it is clear from the ending of this one that this individual will continue to cause much the same trouble as he has thus far.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Hydrofit - Revolutionizing the Fitness Industry and Banishing Cellulite with Innovative Water Workouts Subtitle: A luxurious fitness solution that combines the best of aquatic therapy and exercise to create a game-changing workout experience. Introduction: The fitness industry is in a constant state of evolution, with emerging trends and technologies continually reshaping the way we stay in shape. Enter Hydrofit, a revolutionary new exercise concept that's taking the fitness world by storm in the United States and has now comfortably landed in the luxurious surroundings of a Chelsea gym. As more and more Brits look for effective and enjoyable ways to get fit and maintain their motivation, Hydrofit offers an innovative and uniquely appealing workout that could very well transform their exercise habits for good. What is Hydrofit? At the core of the Hydrofit workout is a cutting-edge exercise pod that houses a choice of either a high-quality exercise bike or treadmill, both of which are submerged in water. The combination of water resistance and the submerged equipment creates an innovative and effective workout environment that burns at least 300 calories in just 30 minutes. In addition to the calorie-burning benefits, Hydrofit users also enjoy the added bonus of power jets carefully positioned to massage their legs as they exercise, targeting cellulite and improving circulation. This aspect of the workout caters to individuals seeking not only an effective exercise but also one that can address aesthetics and support their overall wellbeing. The Origins and Evolution of Hydrofit: With its roots in the United States, the Hydrofit craze has quickly spread across the Atlantic to the UK, where health-conscious individuals are always on the lookout for the latest and most effective fitness solutions. Many members of luxury gyms in affluent areas, such as Chelsea, have already adopted the Hydrofit workout, making it a sought-after offering for those in the upper echelons of the fitness industry. The Science and Benefits behind Hydrofit: The Hydrofit workout is based on the scientifically proven concept of hydrotherapy – a therapeutic treatment that harnesses the natural power of water to create an environment that is nurturing, refreshing, and invigorating. Hydrotherapy has long been known for its numerous health benefits, and now the Hydrofit system takes these benefits even further by incorporating state-of-the-art exercise equipment into the aquatic environment. Working out in water presents numerous advantages that make the Hydrofit experience truly unique: 1. Increased Resistance: Water offers 12 times the resistance of air, meaning that the effort required to exercise in water is greater, leading to a more effective workout and faster results. 2. Low Impact: The buoyancy of water reduces the strain on joints and muscles, making it an ideal workout for people of all ages and fitness levels, as well as those who are recovering from injuries. 3. Enhanced Calorie Burning: The water's resistance also means that more calories are burned during a Hydrofit session compared to a similar workout on land – at least 300 calories can be burned in just 30 minutes. 4. Improved Circulation: The massaging effect of the power jets encourages blood flow to the targeted areas, promoting better circulation and aiding in cellulite reduction. 5. Reduced Stress: The soothing nature of water is well-known for its ability to reduce stress, and the Hydrofit workout adds to this calming effect by offering an invigorating workout that leaves users feeling reinvigorated and ready to face life's challenges. Conclusion: Hydrofit is undoubtedly a game-changer in the world of fitness, catering to a growing demand for effective, enjoyable, and innovative workouts. By seamlessly combining the therapeutic benefits of water with the calorie-burning potential of exercise equipment, this revolutionary method of working out is set to have a lasting impact on the fitness industry for years to come.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Brown village extracted fossil fuels such as coal from their mountains, while Yellow village was mostly focused on extracting gold the old fashioned way. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature? A:","completion":"Brown Village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature. This is because they are extracting and likely using fossil fuels such as coal, which release carbon dioxide when burned.

Article: For 21 years,Georges Bwelle watched his ill father traveling to hospitals,which could not offer him all necessary help. Jamef Bwelle suffered only a broken arm at first,but it finally developed into a hematoma. That would affect him for the rest of his life. Bwelle spent years taking his father to overcrowded hospitals. It was not easy. They would leave home at 5 a.m. and ran to the hospital to be the first. There were a lot of patients. Some people could die because they were waiting. The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002. In Cameroon,there is one doctor for every 5,000 people while in the United States there is one doctor for every 413 people. And even if they could see a doctor,many Cameroonians couldn't afford it. When he saw his father and so many of his countrymen suffer,Bwelle decided to do something about it. He became a doctor himself.And he started an organization,ASCOVIME. It travels into the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care. Since 2008,he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. Almost every Friday,his team jam into vans and travel to villages in need. In each trip they receive 500 people. Patients come on foot from 60 kilometers around the village for free treatment. The next morning,the team will do simple operations in a schoolhouse,town hall or home,and work into the early hours of Sunday morning. On Sunday,the team heads back to the city,tired but proud of their work. They know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help. For his devotion to his country and people,Georges Bwelle becomes one of the 2013 Heroes voted throughout the world. Question: The passage mainly tells us _ . Answer: Options: (a). why Bwelle decided to become a doctor (b). what bad conditions Cameroonians are in (c). that doctors are badly needed in Cameroon (d). how Bwelle has become an admired doctor A:","completion":"The passage primarily narrates the story of how Georges Bwelle became an admired doctor. The chronic lack of medical services in Cameroon created a significant amount of suffering and hardship for patients, including Bwelle's father. Witnessing this, Bwelle decided to become a doctor, and ultimately created a traveling medical service, ASCOVIME, which has since provided free care to nearly 32,000 people in rural areas. Each week, the team travels to underserved villages and performs simple operations on hundreds of patients, using locations like schoolhouses or homes for makeshift operating rooms. For his unwavering dedication, Bwelle was recognized as one of the 2013 Heroes recognized worldwide, a testament to his incredible impact on his community and a testament to his choice to devote his life to bettering healthcare in Cameroon. However, we must note that the other options also provide valid aspects of the narration. Firstly, Bwelle's decision to become a doctor was indeed triggered by the state of healthcare in Cameroon and the suffering it caused, including to his own father. Secondly, the article does highlight the poor conditions and serious healthcare disparities faced by Cameroonians, providing context to Bwelle's decision and subsequent work. Lastly, it certainly emphasizes the critical need for more doctors in Cameroon - a central issue that prompts Bwelle's actions. Still, the main narrative thread throughout the passage is the journey of Bwelle; his transformation from a son helplessly watching his father's suffering to an admired doctor making a tangible difference in his community. It's a story of personal growth, resilience, and profound impact.

In fact, the two sentences present contrasting perspectives on the nature of artifacts and ruins in archaeology. The first sentence suggests that archaeologists are continually intrigued by the mysteries and unanswered questions surrounding the ruins and artifacts they study, such as the enigmatic smile of the Sphinx. It portrays the field of archaeology as one that provokes curiosity and a desire to unravel the complexities of the past. This perspective emphasizes the idea that some aspects of archaeological findings can be elusive and may lead to an ongoing fascination for archaeologists. On the other hand, the second sentence claims that artifacts and ruins provide easy answers and do not give rise to any further questions. This perspective is markedly different from the first sentence, as it asserts that there is a definitive and straightforward understanding of these archaeological discoveries. From this viewpoint, it appears as if the study of artifacts and ruins leads to clear and unambiguous interpretations, with no room for mysteries or additional queries.

The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.

Dan and Jim were interested and read more on the subject. Dan read more about predatory and parasitic protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore and decomposer protozoa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student read less about protozoa that consume dead organic matter? Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Answer:","completion":"Dan read less about protozoa that consume dead organic matter. Justifying my answer, the paragraph tells us that Dan read more about predatory and parasitic protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore and decomposer protozoa.

Does \\"A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the \\"taste of tears\\").\\" correctly answer the question of What is the WHO's recipe for ORS?","completion":"Yes, the statement provided does correctly answer the question of what is the World Health Organization's (WHO) recipe for Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS). The WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS recipe to address dehydration, particularly for those suffering from diarrhea, cholera, and other illnesses that cause fluid loss. The ORS solution is designed to help replenish fluids and electrolytes, helping the body to maintain proper hydration levels and restore electrolyte balance. Here is a detailed and long answer on the WHO's recipe for ORS and its importance: The WHO's recommended ORS recipe consists of the following ingredients: 1. One liter (1000 ml) of clean drinking water 2. One teaspoon (3 grams) of salt 3. Two tablespoons (18 grams) of sugar Mix these ingredients thoroughly and ensure they are completely dissolved in the water. The homemade ORS solution should have a slightly salty taste, often described as similar to the \\"taste of tears.\\" This ORS solution contains essential electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, that help the body restore its hydration balance when fluids are lost due to vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive sweating. The sugar in the solution serves as an energy source and facilitates the absorption of sodium and water in the intestine. This precise balance of electrolytes and glucose enables the body to maximize the effectiveness of the rehydration process. The homemade ORS solution is particularly beneficial in developing countries or remote areas where pre-packaged ORS solutions might be inaccessible or unaffordable. The recipe is simple and utilizes commonly available household ingredients. As a result, the WHO's ORS recipe has played a crucial role in reducing dehydration-related complications and deaths, particularly in young children and vulnerable populations. It is important to remember that prevention and proper management of the underlying cause of dehydration, such as diarrheal diseases, should also be addressed. Consultation with a healthcare professional is essential for appropriate treatment, especially in severe cases. In addition to providing ORS, supportive care and any necessary medications should be administered as recommended by a healthcare professional. While the homemade ORS solution can be a lifesaving tool in certain situations, it is not a substitute for professional medical care and evaluation. Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for the best course of action regarding dehydration and related health conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Projects include a tie-up with London Moorfields eye hospital, which will see it using one million eye scans to train its artificial intelligence system to diagnose potential sight issues, and development of an app to help doctors spot kidney disease. Google's entry on to the healthcare scene has been welcomed by some, notably doctors who are desperate to apply some cutting-edge technology to antiquated NHS systems. But less so by privacy groups and some patients, who have been surprised and concerned that their data - in some cases not anonymised - can be shared with the tech giant's AI division. So what does Google want with our health data and should we be worried? In May it was revealed that Google's DeepMind, had been given access to the healthcare data of up to 1.6 million patients from three hospitals run by London's Royal Free Trust in order to develop an app, called Streams, that would notify doctors should someone be at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). The deal had been announced in February but at the time got little press attention. The biggest question mark was over why so much data was being shared, especially as only a tiny percentage of people would actually benefit from the app. Some were also bemused when it became apparent that the deal with Google's AI firm would not actually involve any artificial intelligence. The reality, explained Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind co-founder, is that AI is simply not yet ready for direct patient care. \\"Finding a fit between an algorithm and training data is difficult. People expect the algorithm to do too much,\\" he said. But, he added, DeepMind wanted to do the project because it wanted to try to make a difference in the NHS, particularly when it came to one of the most fundamental issues it faces - sharing and storing data. \\"The system is crying out for more innovation and hopefully that is something we can pioneer,\\" he said. And, he noted, it was the hospital that sought out DeepMind rather than the other way round. Dr Chris Lang, a kidney doctor, approached the firm to see if a collaboration was possible. \\"We went for coffee and ended up chatting for four hours.\\" Although it has got far more publicity than any others, in fact this deal is a pretty standard one in the NHS. It emerged that the organisation has similar deals with 1,500 different third parties. The NHS claims that it would not be practical to ask every patient to consent to every one of these arrangements. In the tie-up with Moorfields, the data was anonymised and the rules here are that data can be shared for \\"ethically approved projects\\". Patients can opt out of any data-sharing system by emailing their NHS Trust's data protection officer. In the case of the Royal Free, the BBC understands that 148 people have withdrawn their consent, a tiny fraction of the patients involved. Mr Suleyman stressed that none of the data would be shared with other parts of Google. For DeepMind, yes but Google has been looking at healthcare for much longer. From Calico, Alphabet's research and development company whose mission is to \\"tackle ageing\\", to Verily which is currently developing a smart contact lens that can help diabetics monitor glucose levels, the search giant is investing heavily in healthcare. According to Mr Suleyman, \\"making the world a better place\\" has always been part of DeepMind's somewhat lofty ambition to \\"solve intelligence\\". Two years ago he decided that it was a good time to \\"make good the second part of that mission\\" and set about looking for ways where the company could make a difference. \\"We looked at nano-materials, synthetic biology, renewable energy, transport trying to figure out how tech could make a difference and I realised that healthcare - it we could get it right - then the margin for beneficial impact was enormous.\\" The firm seemed genuinely surprised when the announcement created some negative headlines and often reminded journalists that the point of the project was to help save lives. On reflection, Mr Suleyman realises that there was bound to be a backlash. \\"I can completely understand why there was surprise about what we were doing. We have learned a lot and there is a lot we can do to improve - we take that feedback,\\" he said. DeepMind had already been in the process of setting up a panel of independent reviewers, nine technical and clinical experts who have the right to scrutinise what the firm is doing and interview members of the team. \\"We recognise there is still more that we can do,\\" said Mr Suleyman and so the firm has decided to host a patient engagement forum. It will be held on 20 September and will be streamed on YouTube with a Twitter Q&A. It plans to host four such meetings every year. Although Google has always loved experimenting with projects that benefit humankind, it is ultimately in the business of making money and its healthcare work is no exception. It is currently in discussion with the NHS about how to do that and will remain doing so for \\"several years\\", said Mr Suleyman. \\"Right now it is about building the tools and systems that are useful and once users are engaged then we can figure out how to monetise them,\\" he said. The firm has some radical ideas about how it can shake up the commercial relationships between the NHS and third parties. \\"The vast majority of payments made to suppliers in healthcare systems are not often as connected to outcomes as we would like. \\"Ultimately we want to get paid when we deliver concrete clinical benefits. We want to get paid to change the system and improve patient outcomes.\\" Summary:","completion":"Google's DeepMind project has been given access to the healthcare data of up to 1.6 million patients from hospitals run by London's Royal Free Trust in an attempt to develop an app called Streams.

Question: Process: - A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest - The bird makes its own nest. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are less trays left happens, how will it affect LESS birds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned appears to have a slight disconnect - you mention \\"less trays left\\" which does not seem to directly relate to the process of a bird's life cycle. However, it seems that you are trying to understand the impact of a perturbation (a change or disturbance) on the bird population or their life cycle. Assuming you meant \\"less resources or food available\\" as the perturbation, let's analyze how it might affect the process and result in fewer birds. 1. A bird hatches from an egg: The availability of resources or food might affect the number of eggs laid by adult birds. If the adult birds are not able to find enough food, they might not lay as many eggs, leading to a reduction in the number of birds hatching. 2. The bird is nurtured by its parents and is fed food for growth: With less food available, the parents might have difficulty providing enough nourishment to their offspring. As a result, some young birds might not receive adequate nutrition necessary for proper growth, leading to stunted development or even death in some cases. 3. The bird grows and begins to learn how to fly: The lack of sufficient nutrition might affect a bird's ability to grow and develop, resulting in delayed or impaired flying abilities. This might make the birds more vulnerable to predation, reducing their chances of survival. 4. The bird matures and leaves its nest: With limited resources, some birds might take longer to reach maturity, which could affect their ability to fly and find their own territory, further impacting the overall population. 5. The bird makes its own nest: Older birds that have left their nests and started their own families will also face reduced resources and might lay fewer eggs or struggle to provide enough food for their own offspring. Overall, the supposed perturbation (less food or resources) does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of a bird's life cycle. These effects contribute to the reduced survival rate and successful reproduction of birds, ultimately leading to a decreased bird population."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He came into the spotlight with the launch of the Affordable Care Act but told Politico that he felt 'pretty burnt out' and has now left to work as a reporter. In his latest piece for The New Republic, the 32-year-old zones in on the East Wing, where Michelle Obama's initiatives are so intricately planned and plotted- in his view, to their own detriment. 'Unlike her husband, who derives visible satisfaction from his ability to improvise, Mrs. Obama depends on structure to support her public warmth—the ease with which she’ll pick up a hula-hoop, say, or do the Dougie with school kids,' he writes. '(The) first lady’s office can be a confining, frustrating, even miserable place to work. Jealousy and discontentment have festered, as courtiers squabble over the allocation of responsibility and access to Mrs. Obama, both of which can be aggravatingly scarce.' As examples of the inefficiency, he cites. Let's Move launch campaigns that were met with less than overwhelming. receptions and successful initiatives like Mrs Obama's partnerships with. celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and NBA star LeBron James that were. almost waved off before they even started. Close: Reid Cherlin, seen here with the President and his former advisors Stephanie Cutter and another advisor, left the White House in 2011 and has launched a career in journalism. Former East Wing employees explained that the First Lady's nationwide popularity extends into the guarded compound at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as well. 'They don’t want to work for her; they want to be friends with her,' the unidentified individual said. Another explained how 'every meeting was like an identity crisis' as they stressed about whether they were being invited to the daily meetings in Mrs Obama's private office. Cherlin gives examples of how Mrs Obama is seemingly aware but unmotivated by the attention from underlings, opting to place most of her trust in just a few people who have been working with she and her husband for years. 'Chief among the decision-makers are (White House chef Sam) Kass and (advisor Valerie) Jarrett—old family friends who enjoy rare access to the president and first lady’s ultra-secluded living quarters, and to Mrs. Obama’s private thinking,' Cherlin writes. That dependence on longer-term staffers to stick around because of their connection with Mrs Obama has led to some territorial infighting issues as well. He cites the June departure of Kristina Schake, the First Lady's former communications director who thought up the celebrity partnerships that proved so successful. When the West Wing got word of the positive effect of Ms Schake's initiative, President Obama's staffers began to approach her about possibly transferring to their side of the building. Careful planning: Mrs Obama's team has had some less-than-stellar public launches for some of her Let's Move initiatives, and some criticize her for being overly cautious (seen on Tuesday during her trip to China) When rumors about her possible. 'promotion' hit the East Wing water coolers, people were reportedly not. supportive of the step up but immediately skeptical, questioning whether. or not Ms Schake had asked the First Lady's permission to be perusing. other options. In the end, she left politics altogether and now works as the head of communications at L'Oreal. The. article describes how parts of Mrs Obama's personality conflict with. the way that the office is run: while she is known to be very. detail-oriented and demanding when it comes to having every aspect of. her public appearances planned, the same level of scrutiny does not. extend to the way that the East Wing is run. One. former aide described the mentality in the office as being one of 'how. can we be the caliber that we’re expected to be with no attention and no. resources and being an afterthought?' For their part, the East Wing issued a statement saying that the First Lady has been pleased with her successes in the areas of military family support and improved nutrition, even though they used a now-discredited statistic about a drop in obesity rates to justify her work. 'The First Lady is laser-focused on moving the needle wherever and whenever possible,' the statement reads.","completion":"A former White House assistant press secretary, Reid Cherlin, has publicly criticized the office of the First Lady, Michelle Obama. He wrote an article discussing how Mrs. Obama's schedule is too structured and how she interacts with her team. He also mentioned there are problems because there is no clear leadership, which sometimes results in important tasks being forgotten. He mentioned that the smallest mistake, like wearing the wrong outfit, can be seen as a big problem. He also commented that the First Lady's events are very carefully planned, which he thinks isn't always good. He explained that this has caused issues, as not everyone is happy about how work and time with Mrs. Obama are divided. He gave examples of successful activities, like teaming up with famous people like Jimmy Fallon and LeBron James, that were almost stopped before they happened. Lastly, he said that Mrs. Obama prefers to trust and work closely with a few people who have been with her for a long time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What happens when there is too much happening at once?\\" Context: \\"Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \\"time slice\\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"When there is too much happening at once, a computer may experience slowdowns due to the increased demands on its resources. However, because most programs spend a significant amount of time waiting for input/output devices, many programs can run simultaneously without severe speed loss. This is because programs waiting for user input or other events do not consume many resources during these idle periods, allowing other programs to use the available system capacity effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ryback is taking his estranged niece Sarah Ryback (played by a then-unknown Heigl) to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Ryback's brother, who was Sarah's father. They board a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los Angeles. As the train proceeds through the Rockies, two people wave it down. The driver and an engineer step out and are killed. A group of mercenaries led by computer genius Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) and mercenary leader Penn (McGill) hijack the train. Dane is a satellite programming expert who worked on a top secret satellite laser weapon called \\"Grazer One\\". Dane was fired and faked his death. They herd the passengers and staff into the last two train cars and cut the train's phone lines. Two of Dane's former Department of Defense colleagues are on board the train, hiding their romantic relationship that goes against DoD regulations. Dane has them brought to him and threatens to have one of his mercenaries insert a burning needle into their eye, causing it to explode, unless they give him the codes needed to take over Grazer One.

(CNN) -- China's plan to guarantee its economic future depends on empowering and enriching the most downtrodden of its citizens: migrant workers. These are the approximately 250 million people from the countryside that now live and work in Chinese cities but they cannot access government healthcare, education and other social services once they leave their home villages and towns. These migrants are handcuffed by the Soviet-inspired \\"hukou\\" system of housing registration. Introduced in the 1950s, it aimed to prevent farmers and peasants from flooding into the cities and during the Mao years such a move was nearly impossible.

Evaluate the potential rental income: To estimate the rental income, we would need to research the average rental prices per square foot in the area and compare them with the cost per square foot per plot ratio. This will help us understand if the rent prices will be competitive and profitable. 3. Analyze the cost of development: Besides the cost of purchasing the land, GUOCOLAND will also need to invest in the construction and development of the condominium.

He' 11 know it is all right to make mistakes and that he can share with you anything. Appreciate at least one quality in your child every day:Each day look at what qualities your child possesses and appreciate him, maybe for his caring attitude, his dance skills or his observation power. Tell him how proud you are of him because of those qualities. Become his age before bedtime:Jump on the bed, have pillow fights, act silly, dance--become a child with your child for sometime. You' 11 forget all your day's stress. Try these minor things; you' 11 see the love deepen and the relationship blossom. Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE?

It is part of the region of Attica. The capital of the regional unit is the town of Pallini. The regional unit covers the eastern part of the agglomeration of Athens, and also the rural area to its east. - Aegean Airlines S.A. (\\"Aeroporía Aigíou Anónime Etairía\\" ) is the largest Greek airline by total number of passengers carried, by number of destinations served and by fleet size. A Star Alliance member since June 2010, it operates scheduled and charter services from Athens and Thessaloniki to other major Greek destinations as well as to a number of European and Middle Eastern destinations. Its main hubs are Athens International Airport in Athens, Thessaloniki International Airport in Thessaloniki and Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus. It also uses other Greek airports as bases, some of which are seasonal. It has its head office in Kifisia, a suburb of Athens. Although the airline is the largest airline in Greece, it is not a flag carrier. - Kropia is a municipality in East Attica, Greece. It is located 16 km southeast of Athens at the fringes of the Athens metropolitan area, and has a land area of 102.0 km. Its population was 30,307 at the 2011 census. The seat of the municipality is in the town of Koropi (pop. 19,164). In descending order of population, its other villages are Kítsi (pop. 4,788), Agía Marína (3,765), Karellás (1,579), and Ágios Dimítrios (1,011). - An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines utilize aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. - A passenger (also abbreviated as pax) is a person who travels in a vehicle but bears little or no responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle. - A codeshare agreement, sometimes simply codeshare, is an aviation business arrangement where two or more airlines share the same flight. Sharing, in this sense, means that each airline publishes and markets the flight under its own airline designator and flight number as part of its published timetable or schedule. A seat can be purchased on each airline's designator and flight number, but is operated by only one of these cooperating airlines, commonly called the operating carrier or more precisely (and in line with definitions in IATA Standard Schedules Information Manual): \\"Administrating carrier\\". The term \\"code\\" refers to the identifier used in flight schedule, generally the two-character IATA airline designator code and flight number. Thus, XX123 (flight number 123 operated by the airline XX), might also be sold by airline YY as YY456 and by ZZ as ZZ9876. Airlines YY and ZZ are in this case called \\"Marketing airlines\\" (sometimes abbreviated MKT CXR for \\"marketing carrier\\"). Most of the major airlines today have code sharing partnerships with other airlines, and code sharing is a key feature of the major airline alliances. Typically, code-sharing agreements are also a part of the commercial agreements between airlines in the same airline alliances. - Olympic Airlines (\\"Olympiakés Aerogrammés\\" OA), formerly named Olympic Airways for at least four decades, was the flag carrier airline of Greece with their head office in Athens. They operated services to 37 domestic destinations and to 32 destinations world-wide. Their main base was at Athens International Airport, with hubs at Thessaloniki International Airport, \\"Macedonia\\", Heraklion International Airport, \\"Nikos Kazantzakis\\" and Rhodes International Airport, \\"Diagoras\\". Olympic Airlines also owned a base at London Heathrow International Airport. By December 2007, the airline employed about 8,500 staff. - Athens International Airport \\"Eleftherios Venizelos\\" (\\"Diethnís Aeroliménas Athinón \\"Elefthérios Venizélos\\"\\") , commonly initialized as \\"AIA\\", began operation on 28 March 2001 and is the primary international airport that serves the city of Athens and the region of Attica. It is Greece's busiest airport and it serves as the hub and main base of Aegean Airlines as well as other Greek airlines. The airport is currently in Group 2 of Airports Council International (10-25 million) and as of 2016, Athens International is the 28th busiest airport in Europe. - Koropi is a town in East Attica, Greece. It is the seat of the municipality Kropia. It is home of the new training facilities of Panathinaikos football club since the summer of 2013. - Olympic Air S.A. is a regional airline, a subsidiary of the Greek airline carrier Aegean Airlines. It was initially formed from the privatization of the former Greek national carrier Olympic Airlines, a company that carried the name Olympic Airways from 1957 to the beginning of the 21st century. Olympic Air commenced limited operations on 29 September 2009, after Olympic Airlines ceased all operations, with the official full-scale opening of the company taking place two days later on 1 October 2009. Its main hub is Athens International Airport, with Rhodes International Airport serving as secondary hub. The airline's headquarters are in Building 57 at Athens International Airport in Spata, and its registered seat is in Koropi, Kropia, East Attica. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - As of 7 November 2015 , Greek regional airline Olympic Air serves the following 27 destinations : - Spata, is a town east of Athens, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Spata-Artemida, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Q: Passage: The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism. Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, \\"Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The 1740 Batavia massacre (Dutch: Chinezenmoord, literally \\"Murder of the Chinese\\"; Indonesian: Geger Pacinan, meaning \\"Chinatown Tumult\\") was a pogrom in which Dutch East Indies soldiers and native collaborators killed ethnic Chinese residents of the port city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies. The violence in the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October, with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived. In September 1740, as unrest rose among the Chinese population, spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force. On 7 October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar River and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area. The following year, attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre. The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature, and is also cited as a possible...

The easiest way to grow a new ficus is with a cutting from an established plant. The best cutting will be a small sprig that's at least 6 inches (15 cm) long, and with a few leaves on it.","completion":"Step 1: Prepare the cutting Carefully remove the selected cutting from the parent plant by making a clean, diagonal cut just below a leaf node (where a leaf meets the stem). This diagonal cut will help in absorbing more water and rooting hormone, creating ideal conditions for the cutting to grow roots. Remove the lower leaves from the cutting, leaving only a few leaves at the top. Step 2: Apply rooting hormone (optional) For a higher chance of successful rooting, you can dip the cut end of the cutting in a rooting hormone. This step is optional, but it can help accelerate the rooting process and encourage stronger root development. Step 3: Prepare the growing medium Fill a small pot or container with a well-draining potting mix, preferably a mix specifically designed for propagating cuttings. Moisten the potting mix before placing the cutting in it. You can use perlite, vermiculite, or a mixture of peat and sand as a growing medium. Step 4: Plant the cutting Create a hole in the center of the moistened growing medium with a pencil or your finger, deep enough to accommodate at least 2-3 nodes of the cutting. Gently insert the cut end of the cutting into the hole, and firm the growing medium around the cutting to hold it in place. Make sure the remaining leaves are not touching the growing medium to prevent rotting. Step 5: Create a humid environment Cover the pot with a plastic bag or a clear plastic container to create a mini greenhouse that retains humidity. This step is crucial, as it will keep the cutting moist and help prevent it from drying out before it has a chance to grow roots. Step 6: Place the cutting in a suitable environment Place the pot in a warm, bright location with indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight can be too intense and cause the cutting to dry out or get scorched. Step 7: Monitor and care for the cutting Check the cutting regularly for moisture and growth. Make sure the growing medium remains moist but not soggy. If any leaves become yellow or fall off, remove them from the pot to prevent rot or mold growth. Step 8: Check for root development After 4-6 weeks, gently tug on the cutting to check for resistance, indicating root development. Once roots have formed, you can remove the plastic covering and gradually expose the plant to regular indoor conditions. Step 9: Transplant the cutting Once the rooted cutting has grown stronger and shows new growth, it's ready for transplanting into a larger pot with regular potting soil. This step usually occurs 8-12 weeks after planting the cutting. Step 10: Care for the new ficus benjamina Provide the new ficus benjamina plant with proper care, including adequate water, sunlight, and fertilizer, to ensure its continued health and growth.

KATY ISD Superintendent Alton Frailey addresses the media. (Photo: KHOU 11 News) KATY, Texas - Katy ISD's superintendent and the school principal addressed the media for the first time Wednesday afternoon after a seventh grader claimed a teacher forced her to deny God's existence as part of a graded class assignment. Superintendent Alton Frailey praised the student, Jordan Wooley for speaking up when she felt she was being forced to choose between a class assignment and her faith. While Frailey said interviews with several students and the class teacher aren't backing up Wooley's story, some other parents are. \\"Highly inappropriate, has not been used again, will not be used,\\" said Frailey. \\"In fact, it's literally in the trash can.\\" That was Frailey's reaction to the class assignment that's grabbed national headlines and even garnered support from Gov. Greg Abbott on Twitter. \\"(Were) the students told they had to deny God?\\" said Frailey. \\"No one corroborated that.\\" The firestorm started after Wooley, a student at West Memorial Jr. High, told the Katy ISD School Board Monday night she received a graded class assignment earlier in the day that made her answer whether the statement \\"There is a God\\" was a fact, opinion, or common assertion. \\"I said it was fact or opinion,\\" said Wooley. But Wooley said her reading teacher told her both her answers were wrong and that she had to admit God wasn't real. \\"I didn't really know what to do,\\" said Wooley, who told her mother, Chantel Wooley immediately after school. Chantel Wooley told KHOU 11 News shortly before Wednesday's press conference that even after the school's principal called her on Tuesday afternoon, she didn't believe the district was taking responsibility. \\"They're just making it sound like an assignment that shouldn't have gone out, but they're not really talking about how the teacher berated and bullied the children in class,\\" said Chantel Wooley. \\"The Principal talked with at least eight students in class of 22, those assertions were not corroborated by the other students,\\" said Frailey. However, two parents joined Chantel Wooley on an online radio station Wednesday afternoon and disputed the district's claim that the assignment was ungraded. \\"What she said the teacher told them in her class period is also what she told them in my son's class period,\\" said a woman named Deanna, who told Resurrect the Republic Truth Radio that her son received the same assignment. \\"They were always under the assumption that this was for a grade and they were told if they put anything besides myth on that question that it would be wrong.\\" The district also disputed claims by the parents that the same assignment was used in a different class the next day. As for the teacher, Frailey would only say that she's at home Wednesday on her own choosing and that the situation has been \\"addressed appropriately by the principal.\\" Frailey added the assignment was designed by another teacher and handed down. However, Chantel Wooley says she's still trying to move her daughter out of that teacher's class Read or Share this story: http://on.khou.com/1MjOIv7 ||||| Katy ISD Superintendent Alton Frailey and others addressed the media Wednesday afternoon for the first time regarding the claims of a local junior high student who says her teacher forced students to deny God. The firestorm began when West Memorial Junior High 7th-grader Jordan Wooley went before the school board Monday night and said that she believes lesson content involved in her reading class on Monday was inappropriate and overstepped its bounds. She said students were told to identify several statements as fact, opinion or a common assertion in the assignment, and one read ‘There is a God.’ “We were asked to take a poll to say whether God is a fact, opinion or myth, and she (the teacher) said anyone who said it was fact or opinion was wrong and that God is only a myth,” Wooley told the board. Katy ISD said the assignment was meant to test critical thinking skills and not slight anyone’s religious beliefs, but has acknowledged that the statement was inappropriate and “unnecessary in achieving the instructional standard.” According to Wooley, she named the existence of God as both a fact and opinion, but her teacher insisted it was simply a common assertion or myth. When other students argued, it allegedly resulted in a classroom argument which ended with a student slamming everything off their desk in aggravation. Wooley told the school board she countered and attempted to prove her point by citing the Bible and accounts of people who went to heaven and returned to tell their stories, but her teacher allegedly stated that those were not facts and that those people were simply trying to get attention. “She started telling kids that they were completely wrong and when kids would argue, she had told them they would get in trouble,” she said. “I felt like this was really wrong,” she added. “I didn’t feel like it was fair for my faith or my religion to have anything to do with what I am learning about in school.” Wooley also alleged that one of her friends also answered the question as being a fact, but says the teacher crossed it out several times when the student turned it in saying the answer was wrong. However, despite several parents supporting Wooley’s assertions, district officials said at Wednesday’s press conference that Wooley’s statements were not backed up by other students accounts. “The principal talked with at least eight other students in the class of 22 and the teacher as well. In the investigation those assertions were not corroborated by other students. Was the activity graded? No. Was it 40 percent of their grade? Absolutely not. Were the students told they had to deny God? Nobody corroborated that,” Frailey said “She believes what she believes, but other students did not share the same beliefs,” he added. KISD also disputed the claim that the “highly inappropriate” activity was used even the day after the alleged incident. The district says it is no longer in use by the teacher or campus, and appropriate personnel action has been taken. The teacher in question, who the district previously said is “distraught by this incident,” is currently at home by her own volition. Frailey praised Wooley’s courage to take a stand when she truly felt her faith was being challenged. “I applaud Jordan’s courage, and as a parent of three I understand the desire to keep our children safe and not have their beliefs questioned,” Frailey said. “If I had any reason to believe in any evidence to support it, that the teacher did do what has been alleged, I will stand with Jordan as well.” According to the district, the assignment was borrowed from another teacher. Frailey says it is unclear at this time which instructor created the activity. Video of Jordan’s testimony and the district’s press conference can be found at katyisd.org. ||||| Katy student contends school activity called faith into question School superintendent praises student's courage, disputes claim The seventh grader's head barely reached above the podium Monday night as she told Katy ISD board members about a classroom exercise that she felt wrongly called her religious faith into doubt. Two days later, during a Wednesday afternoon news conference held in the same meeting room, Superintendent Alton Frailey praised the student's courage but said a school investigation could not corroborate aspects of her description. By that time, news of Jordan Wooley's four-minute, video-recorded testimony from the meeting had spread like wildfire across Facebook and other social media platforms. \\"Today I was given an assignment in school that questioned my faith and told me that God was not real,\\" she begins in the remarks. On Monday afternoon, in a classroom at West Memorial Junior High School, a teacher had presented Jordan and her classmates with a task: to decide whether certain statements were fact, opinion or commonplace assertions, a category Wooley described as \\"myth.\\" \\"The fastest land dwelling creature is the Cheetah,\\" read the first prompt on the worksheet used for the exercise, according to a screenshot provided by the district. \\"There is a God,\\" read the second. As a Christian, Jordan found the second statement to be fact. But the teacher, also a Christian, said those who thought God's existence was fact or opinion were wrong, as Jordan recounted it. \\"When I tried to argue, she told me to prove it,\\" Jordan said, explaining that her attempt to cite the Bible was discounted. Jordan described the effects of the exercise on her classmates. A friend who went home and began to cry. Another friend who was so aggravated she \\"wound up slamming everything off of her desk,\\" Jordan said. A third of her peers, who asked the teacher if the students could include what they believe on the assignment, and was told, \\"You can if you want to get the problem wrong... You'll fail the paper if you do,\\" Jordan said. The school's investigation, however, found that students were neither forced to deny God nor threatened with a lower or a failing grade if they did not, Frailey said Wednesday. He maintained that the assignment was neither graded nor used by any other teachers. The investigation included interviews with 11 students, including Jordan, according to a news release late Wednesday. Another finding listed in the news release said \\"the activity did not result in any arguments in the classroom.\\" Frailey declined to discuss any action that may have been taken against the teacher, but said she was at home of her own volition. This is the teacher's first year in the school district, he said. Frailey said he would continue to place confidence in the district's teachers regarding the materials used in their classrooms but said the statement regarding God's reality should not have been included on the worksheet. \\"No student in Katy ISD will have their faith denounced,\\" he said. The classroom exercise was \\"designed to encourage critical thinking skills and dialogue,\\" according to a statement from the district, not to \\"question or challenge any student's religious beliefs.\\" \\"The teacher is distraught by this incident, as some commentary has gone as far as to vilify her without knowing her, her Christian faith, or the context of the classroom activity,\\" continued the statement, which did not identify the instructor. \\"Still, this does not excuse the fact that this ungraded activity was ill-conceived and because of that, its intent had been misconstrued.\\" Jordan had reported the incident to her mother, who contacted the school and on the same day brought her daughter to testify to the board. \\"I didn't feel like it was fair for my faith and my religion to have anything to do with what I'm learning about in school,\\" Jordan told the school board. News reports emerged nationwide, and tweets abounded, including one from Gov. Greg Abbott's personal Twitter handle: \\"I'm proud of this 7th grader's unyielding commitment to God. She's Texas tough.\\" Frailey lamented the firestorm. \\"It's unfortunate because there's been a lot of piling on since the time this happened,\\" he said. \\"And you have a teacher under that pile ... a seventh-grade student under that pile, and a parent, a principal and school.\\" Dylan Baddour contributed to this report ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A seventh-grade student in Katy, Texas, claimed that a teacher forced her to deny God's existence as part of a graded class assignment, sparking debate and making headlines.

Its a shame really, as I quite like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer. I was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together!! I think I need to repeat this - The two lead actors (who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together!!!! They did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time. Just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertisement. The dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and un-human like. The scenarios were far fetched, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor mans Tim from The office), nobody was likable, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off, as I couldn't bear to watch, or listen to them any longer.

More young people see opportunity in farming MILWAUKEE – A Wisconsin factory worker worried about layoffs became a dairy farmer. An employee at a Minnesota nonprofit found an escape from her cubicle by buying a vegetable farm. A nuclear engineer tired of office bureaucracy decided to get into cattle ranching in Texas. While fresh demographic information on U.S. farmers won't be available until after a new agricultural census is done next year, there are signs more people in their 20s and 30s are going into farming: Enrollment in university agriculture programs has increased, as has interest in farmer-training programs. Young people are turning up at farmers markets and are blogging, tweeting and promoting their agricultural endeavors through other social media. The young entrepreneurs typically cite two reasons for going into farming: Many find the corporate world stifling and see no point in sticking it out when there's little job security; and demand for locally grown and organic foods has been strong enough that even in the downturn they feel confident they can sell their products. Laura Frerichs, 31, of Hutchinson, Minn., discovered her passion for farming about a year after she graduated from college with an anthropology degree. She planned to work in economic development in Latin America and thought she ought to get some experience working on a farm. She did stints on five farms, mostly vegetable farms, and fell in love with the work. Frerichs and her husband now have their own organic farm, and while she doesn't expect it to make them rich, she's confident they'll be able to earn a living. \\"There's just this growing consciousness around locally grown foods, around organic foods,\\" she said. \\"Where we are in the Twin Cities, there's been great demand for that.\\" Farming is inherently risky: Drought, flooding, wind and other weather extremes can all destroy a year's work. And with farmland averaging 2,140 per acre across the United States. but two to four times that much in the Midwest and California, start-up costs can be daunting. Still, agriculture fared better than many parts of the economy during the recession, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts record profits for farmers as a whole this year. \\"People are looking at farm income, especially the increase in asset values, and seeing a really positive story about our economy,\\" said USDA senior economist Mary Clare Ahearn, citing preliminary statistics. \\"Young people are viewing agriculture as a great opportunity and saying they want to be a part of it.\\" That's welcome news to the government. More than 60% of farmers are over the age of 55, and without young farmers to replace them when they retire the nation's food supply would depend on fewer and fewer people. \\"We'd be vulnerable to local economic disruptions, tariffs, attacks on the food supply, really, any disaster you can think of,\\" said Poppy Davis, who coordinates the USDA's programs for beginning farmers and ranchers. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has called for 100,000 new farmers within the next few years, and Congress has responded with proposals that would provide young farmers with improved access to USDA support and loan programs. One beginning farmer is Gabrielle Rojas, 34, from the central Wisconsin town of Hewitt. As a rebellious teen all she wanted to do was leave her family's farm and find a career that didn't involve cows. But she changed her mind after spending years in dead-end jobs in a factory and restaurant. \\"In those jobs I'm just a number, just a time-clock number,\\" Rojas said. \\"But now I'm doing what I love to do. If I'm having a rough day or I'm a little sad because the sun's not shining or my tractor's broken, I can always go out and be by the cattle. That always makes me feel better.\\" Rojas got help in changing careers from an apprenticeship program paid for by the USDA, which began giving money in 2009 to universities and nonprofit groups that help train beginning farmers. The grants helped train about 5,000 people the first year. This year, the USDA estimates more than twice as many benefited. One of the groups that received a grant is Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service, or MOSES. The Spring Valley, Wis., chapter teaches farming entrepreneurs how to cope with price swings and what to do in cases of catastrophic weather. MOSES also organizes field days, where would-be farmers tour the operations of successful farms to learn and share tips. Attendance is up 20% this year, director Faye Jones said, and some outings that used to attract 30 or 40 people have drawn as many as 100, most between the ages of 18 and 30. \\"I think for many people, farming has been a lifelong dream, and now the timing is right,\\" she said. Among the reasons she cited: the lifestyle, working in the fresh air and being one's own boss. If farming is beginning to sound like an appealing career, there are downsides. The work involves tough physical labor, and vacations create problems when there are crops to be harvested and cows to be milked. In addition, many farmers need second jobs to get health insurance or make ends meet. As the USDA notes, three-fifths of farms have sales of less than 10,000 a year, although some may be growing fruit trees or other crops that take a few years to develop. None of those factors dissuaded 27-year-old Paul Mews. He left a high-paying job as a nuclear engineer last year to become a cattle rancher in Menard, Tex. His wife's family has been ranching for generations, and Mews decided he'd much rather join his in-laws and be his own boss than continue shuffling paperwork at the plant. \\"When you're self-employed, it's so much more fulfilling. You get paid what you're worth,\\" he said. \\"It's really nice that what you put into it is what you're going to get back out.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"An increasing number of young people in their 20s and 30s are turning to farming as a way to escape the corporate world and enjoy a more fulfilling career. They often cite a lack of job security and a stifling corporate environment as their reasons for leaving, and feel the demand for locally grown, organic produce is a strong enough market for them to sell their products. With enrollment in university agriculture programs rising and more young farmers promoting their work on social media, this shift is welcome news for the government due to the fact that more than 60% of farmers are over the age of 55.

Question: Mike's soda can will roll at a greater rate of speed on the driveway then in the hallway. This means the _____ has more friction (A) driveway (B) hallway Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is (B) hallway. To clarify this, we must first understand the concept of friction - it is the force that resists the motion of an object. According to the laws of physics, in an ideal environment, the only thing that would naturally slow down a rolling object would be friction. A greater rate of friction slows the object more, while less friction allows the object to move more freely and potentially at greater speed. Drawing a comparison between a driveway and a hallway, two distinct scenarios are presented: the rolling of a soda can on a driveway and the rolling of the same soda can in a hallway. Here, it has been observed that the can rolls at a significantly higher speed on the driveway than in the hallway. What can we infer from this? If the soda can rolls more quickly on the driveway, it indicates that there is less friction on the driveway. When the can is rolling in the hallway, and it rolls more slowly, it's because more friction exists there to slow the can's motion. This slowed rolling speed is precisely due to the higher frictional force in the hallway. Hence, among the options of (A) driveway and (B) hallway, it would be accurate to say the hallway has more friction. If you recall the rule - 'slower motion indicates higher friction' - you might find similar questions easier in the future. Also to note is the fact the friction not only depends on the nature of the surfaces in contact but also on the weight of the object. In our situation, the weight of the can remains constant, so the variance in speed is purely due to the difference in friction on the different surfaces. The composition, texture, and other physical factors of hallways and driveways may vary, which can significantly impact the amount of friction each surface exerts on objects in contact with them. Driveways, generally being outdoor spaces, are often designed for easier movement of vehicles, with smoother, harder surfaces that may be less frictional than the indoor surfaces of hallways, which are often covered in carpet or other more frictional materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Where did Ruisdael live for over 25 years? is inside the article: During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

If you purchased your ticket online online, you will need to make sure it got delivered to the correct airline. Answer:","completion":"a. Check that confirmation to make sure the flight is still scheduled to take off on time. If your flight time has changed, make sure to adjust your travel plans accordingly. The other options don't make sense in the context that we're given. We're talking about how to check in at the airport, right? Option b suggests that simply receiving an email means your flight will be successful, but it doesn't say anything about checking in at the airport. Option c starts off talking about confirmation emails, which is fine, but then it suddenly brings up a video game console (ps2) and a gaming network (psn), which don't have anything to do with flying! Option d talks about mailing in a reservation or sending a confirmation email only after landing. But we haven't even left the ground yet! We're still figuring out how to check in, remember? So that's why option a is the right choice. It directly explains what to do with the confirmation email in preparation for your flight and how it relates to the check-in process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the context: What does Riley need to do before this? Possible answers: listen to Riley's poetry, see everyone's reaction to the poetry, ask Kendall how they felt Answer:","completion":"Before Riley can express Kendall's feelings through poetry and recite it in front of everyone, they must undergo a series of important steps to ensure that the poem truly reflects Kendall's emotions and that the audience receives it well. Firstly, Riley needs to have a deep conversation with Kendall about their feelings and emotions. They should ask open-ended questions that encourage Kendall to elaborate on their emotions and experiences. This conversation will provide the foundation and inspiration for the poem. Next, Riley should research various poetic styles, techniques, and forms that might best suit the emotions they want to convey. They should consider using metaphors, similes, imagery, and other language techniques to create a vivid and evocative piece of poetry. Once a general idea is formed, Riley can proceed to write the poem. They should be mindful to capture Kendall's feelings authentically while also using their own creative voice as a poet. During this process, they might need to revise and edit the poem repeatedly, refining it to make sure it resonates with both Kendall's emotions and the intended audience. After completing the poem, Riley should share it with Kendall and ask for their feedback. This step is essential to ensure that Riley has accurately captured Kendall's feelings and that Kendall is comfortable with their emotions being shared in this format. If needed, Riley can make any necessary adjustments to the poem based on Kendall's suggestions. Once Kendall approves, Riley can practice reciting the poem. This will involve Riley rehearsing the correct tone, pacing, and delivery to effectively communicate the emotions embedded within the poetry. They might consider incorporating subtle body language or facial expressions to further heighten the emotional impact during the recitation. Before the public recitation, Riley could hold a private reading with a small, trusted group to get feedback on the poem and the recital. By observing the audience's reaction, they can make any final tweaks to their delivery and presentation. This step will also help to build Riley's confidence in sharing the poem with a larger group of people. Finally, when Riley is satisfied, they're ready to recite Kendall's feelings through poetry in front of everyone. The attention to detail in the preparation process will ensure that the poem accurately represents Kendall's emotions and provides a powerful and meaningful experience for the audience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New York (CNN)An art enthusiast paid 5,212 in 2013 at a London auction for a painting of an 19th-century English landscape. That price was well above Christie's auction house estimated value of 760 to 1,200. This week, however, the painting's price jumped dramatically -- 1,000 times its previous value -- at a Sotheby's auction in New York. It sold Wednesday for 5.2 million. The discrepancy in the value of \\"Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows\\" is due to a difference of opinion by art experts at the rival auction houses. Christie's analyzed the painting in 2013 and declared that it was the work of a follower of John Constable -- not a creation of the famed English Romantic landscape artist himself. \\"We are aware that OPTIONS: - CNN's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - Christie's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - English's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - English Romantic's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - John Constable's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - London's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - New York's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement. - Sotheby's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement.","completion":"- Sotheby's have sold this work as by Constable,\\" the auction house said in a statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: New Orleans, Louisiana. While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a decapitated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, suggesting that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge.At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting. The folded ribbon adorning the casket seen inside the hearse bears a name tantalizingly similar to Devereux's own.

News article: Melissa McCarthy: I’ve Dated ‘So Many’ Gay Guys Melissa McCarthy, 43, has been married to Ben Falcone since 2005, but her love life was a bit complicated before that. The “Mike & Molly” star opened up to “Advocate” about growing up having many gay friends – and gay boyfriends. When questioned if she’d ever dated a gay guy before, she responded quite candidly: “Just one?” She continued: “There were so many. In my early 20s, I was like the last stop before a guy said, ‘Yep, it’s official: I’m gay.’ I’d be like, ‘Really?!’ I’d think, ’But he’s so funny, so charming and such a good dresser.’ I never saw it coming.” Besides dating a string of men that would never love her the way she loved them, McCarthy also questioned her own sexual preferences at one point. “Growing up with so many gay friends, I was always in the minority as a straight girl, so there was definitely a time when I was like, “Boy, everywhere we go, I’m not meeting any fun guys. … Am I looking in the wrong place?” the actress said. “But then I met Ben and [sighs] I liked him.” After dating gay men and wondering if she, herself, was gay, the former “Gilmore Girls” star is now married to Falcone and they have two accepting daughters, Vivian and Georgette Falcone. “I love that my girls see no difference between those same-sex couples and the male-female couples that we hang out with,” McCarthy said. “I’m more proud of that than anything.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Duh...Pick from: 1). negative 2). positive I think the answer is","completion":"Negative. This review clearly communicates the author's dissatisfaction with their experience. The sentiment is predominantly negative due to several reasons: 1. Bad service: The use of 'bad' directly indicates a negative experience. When it comes to restaurant reviews, great service forms an integral part of a positive dining experience. The word 'bad' reveals dissatisfaction with how they were treated or served at this establishment. 2. Edible pizza: At first glance, describing a pizza as 'edible' may seem neutral, as it simply implies the food was fit for consumption. However, in the context of a review, it is negative because it suggests the pizza was just bearable to eat and not enjoyable. 'Edible' is a low standard for food in a dining establishment, suggesting that while the food was not so poor that it was inedible, it wasn't good either. 3. Lazy staff: 'Lazy' is another negative adjective used here. It suggests that the staff lacked enthusiasm, were slow, or did not take proper effort in delivering service. This once again points to a poor dining experience. 4. Got everything but chicken and crust wrong on my pizza: This indicates that the author's order was misunderstood or mishandled, apart from chicken and crust. Given that this is usually a fundamental part of a restaurant's service, getting it wrong negatively impacts the diner's experience. 5. Use of 'Duh': This word often implies annoyance, sarcasm, or disbelief, reinforcing the negative sentiment of the reviewer. Overall, the author seems disappointed with both the service and the product (pizza), implying an overall negative sentiment. This dissatisfaction might be likely to discourage other potential customers from trying this restaurant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tweet: storm clouds incoming by the looks of it... sad times for frisbee later Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet appears to be mildly negative. To understand this sentiment, let's break down each part of the tweet. 1. \\"storm clouds incoming\\": This phrase indicates that the weather is changing, with storm clouds approaching. Generally, storm clouds are associated with gloomy, unfavorable weather conditions, which might cause people to feel negative emotions such as disappointment or sadness. 2. \\"by the looks of it\\": This part suggests that the tweeter is making an observation or basing their statement on visual evidence, even if not confirmed. They may not be certain about the incoming storm clouds, but they strongly believe that is what they see based on their observation. 3. \\"sad times for frisbee later\\": This is the part where the tweeter is explicitly expressing a negative emotion—sadness—regarding their later plans to play frisbee. The anticipated storm clouds make it likely that they will have to cancel or postpone their outdoor activity. This creates a feeling of disappointment as they may have been looking forward to playing with others, having fun, and possibly enjoying a moment of relaxation. By analyzing these components of the tweet, it becomes apparent that the overall sentiment is negative, albeit mildly so.

He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

By 1916, \\"successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousands.\\"General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), an elderly member of the French General Staff, arrives from Paris at the headquarters (a magnificent chateau) of his subordinate, General Paul Mireau (George Macready), to inform him that a major offensive is planned for General Mireau's sector and, in preparation for this offensive, General Broulard wants Mireau's division to capture a well-defended German position nicknamed the 'Anthill'. Mireau balks at the idea, claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the Anthill, much less capture it. Broulard reluctantly mentions that, in a completely unrelated matter, he was thinking that Mireau was due for a promotion, not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the Anthill. After explaining to Broulard at great length that the men he commands mean more to him than \\"all the stars and decorations in France,\\" the ambitious Mireau concludes that an attack on the Anthill just might work.Mireau undertakes an inspection of the front line trenches with his loyal and cynical staff officer, Major Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson). The general stops to ask several soldiers (who later become major characters) the question, \\"Ready to kill more Germans?\\" When one soldier (Fred Bell) fails to answer, merely staring straight ahead, his comrades reply that the soldier is suffering from shell shock. Mireau says there is no such thing as shell shock.

Context: Eventually, when it was more common for electric recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, making it possible to improve the damping of spurious resonances. Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the march that Con Whalen said was \\"a waste of time\\" though he enjoyed every step? ? Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

Possible answers: listen to preachers who deny miracles, become a strong prayer warrior, go to Sunday school for the 1st time Answer:","completion":"Before Carson can raise another dog up from the dead when he hears that Jack's dog had died, he would need to develop strong spiritual abilities or powers, which may involve engaging in activities that strengthen his faith and spiritual connection. Of the possible answers provided: 1. Listening to preachers who deny miracles would not necessarily help Carson in his quest, as their beliefs likely contradict the idea of raising a dog from the dead. In fact, this might deter or demotivate him from attempting such an act. 2. Becoming a strong prayer warrior could be beneficial, as it implies that Carson would be developing a deep spiritual connection and possibly enhancing his understanding of faith and divine power. Through prayer, he might be able to ask for the ability or guidance to perform such extraordinary acts. 3. Going to Sunday school for the first time may not directly enable Carson to raise the dead, but it could be the beginning of his spiritual journey. Through attending Sunday school, he would learn about religious teachings, moral values, and potentially stories of miracles and divine power.

Process: - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You have less strong genetic makeup happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If an individual has a weaker genetic makeup that affects liver function, it could potentially lead the liver to work harder in order to properly process and clean the blood. This could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects: A weaker genetic makeup could result in the liver having fewer or less efficient enzymes to process toxins and other chemicals found in the blood. This would mean the liver would need to work harder or longer to complete the same tasks it would normally accomplish with ease. Over time, this additional workload could cause the liver to become strained and potentially lead to liver damage or a decreased overall liver function. Indirect effects: A liver that has to work harder might indirectly affect other bodily processes or organs. For example, if the liver struggles to remove toxins from the blood effectively, these toxins could potentially accumulate in the body and cause damage to other organs or systems. Additionally, since the liver is also responsible for metabolizing drugs and hormones, a decrease in its efficiency could impact the body's hormonal balance or the way in which medications are processed. In summary, a less-strong genetic makeup causing the liver to work harder could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process of blood filtering and overall health of the individual. It is important for individuals with known genetic predispositions to liver-related issues to maintain regular checkups with their healthcare provider and adopt healthy lifestyle choices to help mitigate these potential effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In which round of Wimbledon in 2009 was Andy Murray knocked out?","completion":"In the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, Andy Murray, a professional tennis player from Scotland, was knocked out in the semi-finals. Murray had an impressive run throughout the championship, but ultimately, he was defeated by American player Andy Roddick in an intense match, bringing his Wimbledon journey to an end. Before facing Roddick, Murray had successfully defeated his previous opponents in the tournament. His progress can be summarized as follows: 1. In the first round, he played against Robert Kendrick from the United States and won with a 7-5, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4 scoreline. 2. In the second round, he faced Ernests Gulbis from Latvia and claimed victory with a straight-set win at 6-2, 7-5, 6-3. 3. In the third round, he encountered Viktor Troicki from Serbia and defeated him with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 scoreline. 4. In the fourth round, Murray played against Stanislas Wawrinka from Switzerland. This intense battle lasted for five sets, but ultimately Murray prevailed with 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 win. 5. In the quarter-finals, he competed against Juan Carlos Ferrero from Spain and won convincingly with a straight-set victory at 7-5, 6-3, 6-2.

Question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: Options: - still new - In need of renovations - An historical landmark - not enough information Answer:","completion":"An historical landmark"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies. The use of digital rights management is not universally accepted. Proponents of DRM argue that it is necessary to prevent intellectual property from being copied freely, just as physical locks are needed to prevent personal property from being stolen, that it can help the copyright holder maintain artistic control, and that it can ensure continued revenue streams. Those opposed to DRM contend there is no evidence that DRM helps prevent copyright infringement, arguing instead that it serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers, and that DRM helps big business stifle innovation and competition. Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued. DRM can also restrict users from exercising their legal rights under the copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs (instead having to buy another copy, if it can still be purchased), lending materials out through a library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the fair use doctrine, and under French law.

The tireless efforts of the lead scientist, Dr. Logan, and his diverse team have led to a breakthrough discovery that challenges the very fabric of reality. Dr. Logan, a brilliant yet stoic scientist haunted by his tragic past, is unyielding in his pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of human potential. With a seemingly infinite supply of resources provided by their international funding partners, Logan and his team have finally achieved the unthinkable. The invention, aptly titled \\"The Glimpse,\\" has captured the attention of global leaders and sparked an array of possible applications, ranging from the unimaginable to the dystopian. As the movie opens, we witness the inaugural test of The Glimpse. Dr. Logan decides to venture back in time to a small, prehistoric village located in what is now modern-day Europe. Upon arrival, he discovers that his machine's presence threatens the stability of the primitive society, initiating a ripple effect that could alter the future as we know it. Fearing the consequences, Dr. Logan must quickly learn how to navigate the delicate balance of his newfound reality while trying to right the wrongs his invention has caused. As the movie progresses, we follow Dr. Logan through several time periods, beginning with Ancient Egypt, moving through medieval Europe during the Black Plague, and making a daring foray into the height of the Industrial Revolution. With the world's timeline becoming more unstable with each leap through time, he encounters other scientists whose lives have been forever changed by his groundbreaking invention. Logan soon realizes that even the tiniest of changes in their actions can have severe consequences for the future. Dr. Logan's journey through time becomes deeply personal when he is faced with a series of moral dilemmas. Through his encounters with history's most influential figures and harrowing moments, he struggles to reconcile his role as a scientist with his innate sense of human compassion. This internal conflict leads him to question the ethics of his own invention and the true meaning of progress. As the movie reaches its climax, Dr. Logan must face the consequences of his life's work. He returns to his present timeline, only to find that his actions have given rise to a world even more dystopian and chaotic than he could have imagined. Anarchy has broken loose, borders have dissolved, technology has made society eerily distant, disconnected, and devoid of human connection. Desperate to restore order to the present reality, Dr. Logan rallies his team of scientists one final time, pledging to repair the world they have all inadvertently shattered. Together, they embark on a race against time to uncover the secret to stabilizing the massive ripple effect they have created. In a final act of redemption, Dr. Logan and his team must use their vast knowledge and innovative spirits to secure a future where the terrors of mankind's past serve as a cautionary tale rather than a recurring tragedy. In the end, \\"A Glimpse Through Time\\" is a thrilling, thought-provoking, and heartfelt journey that follows the triumphs and tribulations of one man's pursuit of knowledge and the power it wields. Driven by love, loss, and the unwavering belief in human potential, Dr. Logan and his team embark on a harrowing adventure that ultimately leads to a renewed understanding of the intrinsic value of time, history, and the responsibility of those who forge the path forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank Ferrer joined the band in 2006 as their official drummer. Ferrer became part of Guns N' Roses after being introduced to the band by Richard Fortus, the rhythm guitarist. Before becoming a member of Guns N' Roses, Frank Ferrer had played with several other notable artists and bands such as The Psychedelic Furs, The Beautiful, and Pisser. Ferrer replaced Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia, who was also part of the ever-changing lineup of the iconic rock band. Over the years, Guns N' Roses has seen a number of lineup changes, including several drummers. The band was formed in 1985 and gained international fame with their debut album, \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" in 1987. The original drummer for Guns N' Roses was Steven Adler, who played with the band from 1985 until 1990. He was part of the classic lineup that also included Axl Rose on vocals, Slash on lead guitar, Izzy Stradlin on rhythm guitar, and Duff McKagan on bass. This lineup is responsible for some of the band's most iconic hits, such as \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Sweet Child o' Mine,\\" and \\"Paradise City.\\" Unfortunately, due to personal struggles and addiction, Steven Adler was fired from the band in 1990. Following Adler's departure, Guns N' Roses hired Matt Sorum as their new drummer. Sorum had previously played with the rock band The Cult. He joined the band in 1990 and stayed with them until 1997. During his time with Guns N' Roses, Sorum played on the albums \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" and \\"Use Your Illusion II,\\" as well as \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\". Matt Sorum was a key contributor during this period and helped the band maintain its success in the early to mid-1990s. In 1997, Guns N' Roses went through another significant lineup change, with several original members leaving the group, including Slash and Duff McKagan. Axl Rose became the only remaining member from the original lineup, and he continued to work on new music with various musicians throughout the years. In 2000, drummer Josh Freese joined the band but left after only six months due to other commitments. Between 2000 and 2006, the band's lineup continued to change, with Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia taking over the role as the drummer from Freese. Brain played with Guns N' Roses through the recording process of their long-awaited album \\"Chinese Democracy\\" which was eventually released in 2008. However, in 2006, before the album's release, Brain left the band and was replaced by Frank Ferrer, who remains the drummer for Guns N' Roses today. In recent years, Guns N' Roses have seen a partial reunion, with Slash and Duff McKagan rejoining the band in 2016. They have been touring together since then, with Frank Ferrer continuing to maintain his position as the drummer. Frank Ferrer's solid drumming skills and ability to adapt to the band's dynamic have made him an integral part of Guns N' Roses in their current era."},{"prompt":"Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do genes contain?\\" is \\"viruses\\", given that genes contain blueprints?

A 21-year-old man was left in a coma and eight others were hospitalized after attending a weekend pool party in the Mexican city of Leon where organizers of the event poured liquid nitrogen into the water. According to authorities of the Health Department of Leon in the state of Guanajuato, the party that took place Saturday was organized by Jagermeister, the alcoholic beverage maker based out of Germany. According to witness accounts and videos recorded at the event, organizers of the soiree hosted in La Colonia Granjas El Palote attempted to create a smoke effect by pouring four buckets of liquid nitrogen into the pool. Scroll down for videos. Bad move: Employees dressed in orange unfirms could be seen pouring liquid nitrogen into the pool, which quickly filled with thick white smoke. Party gone awry: The event held in the Mexican city of Leon was hosted by the German alcoholic beverage company Jagermeister. Crowded soiree: There were about 200 people who turned out at the pool party, among them several hostesses hired to promote the drinks. Officials say that when the liquid nitrogen came in contact with the water, the chemical substance with a low boiling point displaced oxygen, leaving young party goers gasping for breath, Excelsior.com reported. Guests who were milling about around the pool quickly realized that those inside the water began passing out and quickly called for help. Blacked out: Hostess Jael Jimenez said she passed out from asphyxiation while swimming in the pool and was rescued because other gusts spotted her tray floating in the water. The victims were pulled to safety by paramedics and rushed to the regional hospital where many had been diagnosed with cardiovascular problems. One of the victims, identified by Univision Noticias as 21-year-old Jose Ignacio Lopez del Toro, remains in intensive care in a comatose state. The other eight people received medical attention in the Campestre Medical Hospital and have since been released. Assistant Attorney General Manuel Angel Hernandez has launched a preliminary investigation to determine if charges would be filed in connection to the incident. In a statement sent. to MailOnline Wednesday, Jagermeister stated that the company is aware. of the incident, which is currently being investigated by officials at. Jagermeister’s headquarters in Germany. ‘We are liaising with the responsible. distributor in Mexico who is working with the event organisers and the. investigating authorities to understand the full circumstances. surrounding the events last Saturday night,’ the statement read. ‘We fully support responsible drinking and adhere to the guidelines within each market in which we operate.’ Aftermath: Liquid nitrogen reacting with chlorine in the water formed a toxic cloud that left the young party goers gasping for breath. Injured: Nine people were taken to area hospitals for treatment, including a 21-year-old man who suffered from cardiovascular complications that landed him in a coma.

Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The structure outlined above probably won’t apply for most college entrance exams: though its simplicity makes it very handy for quick, inconspicuous bios, the whole point when applying to college is to stand out. The best way to do this is to make the structure your own by telling a story, not outlining key factoids. There are many possible structures to choose from, including: Chronological: This structure starts at the beginning and ends at the end. It’s the most straightforward and works well if you’ve had an interesting life that has taken you from A to B to C in unusual or impressive ways (for example, truly beating the odds). Circular: This structure start at an important or climactic moment (D), backtracks (A), and then explains all the events leading up to that moment (B, C), eventually bringing the reader full circle. This is good for building suspense, especially when Event D is so strange or unbelievable that the reader doesn’t mind being led around for a bit. Zoomed In: This structure focuses on one critical event (for example, C) to symbolically tell a larger story. It might use a few small, surrounding details (a, d) to orient the reader, but otherwise, the moment is important enough to stand on its own. Colleges want to hear your life story so that they can figure out whether or not you’re a good fit for them. That said, showing how good a match you are for the school doesn’t mean getting sidetracked by trying to describe the school as well. Incorrect: \\"UCSF has one of the top-ranked research-based med schools in the world, which would provide me with the foundation necessary to achieve my lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.\\" The school you’re applying to already knows what its programs and facilities are like, so don’t waste the reader’s time. On top of that, praising the school at the expense of describing yourself makes you sound unworthy to attend. Correct: \\"Watching a trauma surgeon save my brother’s life at the age of five is a moment I’ll never forget. Since that day, I’ve known without a doubt that I would dedicate my life to medicine. My brother was lucky that his surgeon studied at one of the best programs in the country. By doing the same, I hope to one day mean to another family what Dr. Heller does to mine.\\"This description of the narrator is on-point, personal, and memorable. Though it still subtly praises the UCSF facilities, it doesn’t sound like it’s trying to score brownie points. Even if you manage to do it well, which is hard when you’re not inspired by truth, the best that will happen is that you will seem like hundreds or thousands of other students who used the same strategy. Instead, talk about what’s real and what matters to you. Don’t have the most amazing life? Embrace it – and whatever you do, don’t fight above your weight class. Trying to force a ho-hum story to be more dramatic will just make it look silly, especially compared to the truly epic tales some of your co-applicants will have. Incorrect: \\"Reading The Great Gatsby was a pivotal moment in my life that made me completely rethink my own preconceptions about what it means to live in modern America. Thanks to that assignment, I now know I want to pursue American Studies.\\" Correct: \\"My family’s ties to this country aren’t particularly glamorous. We didn’t arrive on the Mayflower, or have our surname butchered at Ellis Island, or receive amnesty after fleeing a foreign dictatorship. What we did is settle in four states across the Midwest, where we’ve lived happily for over a hundred years. The magic of that simple act isn’t lost on me, which is why I’ve chosen to major in American Studies.\\" That’s what your SATs were for. While you shouldn’t use slang or dumb your essay down, your content should speak for itself; going nutty with the vocabulary will just be a distraction. Plus, the admissions board slogs through you-don’t-even-want-to-know-how-many essays every year, and the last thing they want to hear is another person trying to wrestle a five-syllable word into a place where it has no earthly business. Incorrect: \\"Having had a rather minimalistic upbringing, I find that I continue to assiduously value hard work and frugality above all else.\\"Unless you’re a Dickensian countess or one of Jane Austen’s comic relief characters, this just doesn’t work. It sounds like you're trying too hard. Correct: \\"Growing up very poor taught me that hard work and thrift are sometimes the only things a person can afford.\\" Impactful and to-the-point – all with no words longer than two syllables. This is one of the most important things you can do to help your bio stand out. Many students will state things like \\"I learned a valuable lesson from this experience\\" or \\"I developed a new understanding of X.\\" Showing through concrete detail is much more effective. Incorrect: \\"I learned a lot from my experience as a camp counselor.\\"This says nothing about what you actually learned, and is a sentence that will probably be in hundreds of college bios. Correct: \\"I came out of my time as a camp counselor with a better understanding of empathy and connection than I had previously. Now, when I see my younger sister acting up, I understand better how to help her without sounding bossy or controlling.\\" The \\"passive voice\\" occurs when you use forms of the verb to be, and it usually makes your sentences wordier and unclear. Using active, present-tense verbs makes your writing more alive and interesting. Consider the difference between the following sentences: \\"The window was broken by the zombie\\" and \\"The zombie broke the window.\\" In the first, you have no idea whether the window by the zombie just happened to be broken.

Article: Motorist killed in bus crash ID’d as Beach Park man By Frank Abderholden fabderholden@stmedianetwork.com A statement from the family of Philip Smith An entrepreneur, Philip Smith, 62, of Beach Park, had owned several businesses, primarily in construction, and he could build nearly anything. Smith built two planes and a glider at his home, and he was building another plane. He confidently flew his two-seater planes. He took his brother-in-law for his first and only plane ride in one of his small home-built aircraft. Smith was hands-on and outdoorsy, and he always had a new interest or project. At one time, he built three pigeon coops for homing pigeons in his backyard. He was a regular at the hardware store, his family said, then added, “all of them.” Smith, who grew up in Beach Park and Winthrop Harbor, built several homes in Zion and his own home in Beach Park. He had many varied interests and liked to read all kinds of magazines. He was a great cook, and he enjoyed preparing meals for his family and friends. Although those who knew him called him by the nickname “Grump” because of his taciturn nature, they also said he was the first to offer an “Atta boy” or “Good job, kid.” He spoke his mind, saying what needed to be said in a few words, but also was thoughtful. He carefully chose gifts and often surprised loved ones with a magazine subscription or something else he knew they would enjoy. Smith was married for 19 years to Lisa (Davis) Smith, formerly of Antioch, and the father of two daughters, Tracy Paulsen and Cassidy Smith, and the grandfather of Stephanie Smith. He enjoyed spending time with his girls doing active things. Smith planned to attend the Jeep Jamboree in Aspen, Colorado, in August. He was driving a distinctive yellow Jeep he bought and customized for his wife as a Christmas present, but he had built his own custom Jeep for the Jamboree. The family appreciates the concerns and condolences expressed by family and friends during this difficult time. — Diana Newton, longtime friend of Lisa Smith Article Extras Related Stories Parents rush to reunite with kids in bus crash Beach Park man killed in crash ‘could build almost anything’ Bus accident sheds light on dangerous intersections No charges in bus crash near Wadsworth Investigation of fatal crash reveals Jeep hit bus Maps Updated: A Beach Park motorist was killed and more than two dozen children sent to area hospitals after their school bus collided with two vehicles on a Lake County road Friday morning. Philip Smith, 62, died at the scene after his yellow Jeep Wrangler was struck by the No. 23 Durham School Services bus bound for Newport Elementary School in Wadsworth. There were no fatalities among the children on the bus. The crash occurred at 8:03 a.m. Friday morning near Route 173 and Kilbourne Road in unincorporated Newport Township. According to Lake County Sheriff Mark Curran, the bus, traveling westbound on Route 173, struck the southbound Wrangler, “essentially close to a T-bone.” Curran said that the driver of the bus, which rolled onto its right side, was coherent and talking with police and toxicology tests were performed. Initial reports from the scene indicated the bus, “may have been late for the light,” Curran said. However, witnesses later came forward to say said that the bus driver did not go through a red light, according to Lake County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Sgt. Sara Balmes. “The bus windows (were) crashed out,” Curran said during a morning press conference. “It’s a bad scene.” A Jeep Grand Cherokee with at least two occupants also was involved. However, it was unclear what direction the vehicle was traveling, or how it was struck, Curran said. Two adults in the Grand Cherokee were transported to hospitals. There were 35 students — kindergarten though fifth grade — on the bus said Bob DiVirgillo, Beach Park School District superintendent. Of those, 23 were transported by a second school bus to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville, all of whom were in good condition, said Dr. Debra Susie-Lattner. Dr. Charles Nozicka said the children treated at Condell were calm and sustained only minor injuries. “Luckily, most of them were just shaken up,” said Nozicka, medical director of the pediatric emergency room. “They had contusions and bruises and a few broken extremities.” Most of those were hand or finger fractures, he said. A few suffered minor head injuries, he said. One child was being kept for observation, though he couldn’t say whether the youngster would remain overnight. The children largely were calm while they were being treated, Nozicka said. “The children were actually very well behaved,” he said. Most were tossed out of their seats in the crash, he said. “Most of them told us they were on a seat and ended up on the floor.” An additional 12 students were transported by ambulance to Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and St. Catherine’s Hospital in Pleasant Prairie, Wis. The six students sent to Visa were immediately triaged with their conditions assessed by Vista’s Emergency Department staff of physicians and nurses. An 11-year-old female was in fair condition after sustaining a skull fracture. She was stabilized and later transported by ambulance to the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. The remaining two boys and three girls were treated and released to their parents. The bus company is Durham School Services and it has had the bus contract for several years, DiVirgilio said. In a statement released Friday afternoon, the company said it is working with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office to determine the cause of the crash. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the driver of the Jeep who sustained fatal injuries, as well as with all of those affected by this accident,” the statement read. “... We will continue to monitor the status of those injured. Safety is Durham’s top priority, and we are taking every step necessary to ensure that this accident is investigated and responded to appropriately.” The Sheriff’s Office also is working with the Major Crash Assistance Team to evaluate the scene, Curran said. Lake County Sheriff’s Chief of Operations Brian Keller said the intersection has had major crashes in the past and was updated last year with a traffic light controlled intersection. “The lights have been there about a year now,” he said. Marcie Bosnak, principal of nearby St. Patrick’s School in Wadsworth, said her school does not use the Beach Park school buses, but some of the pre-K through eighth-graders who attend St. Patrick’s live in that community. “I am sure there are connections between the families,” said Bosnak, who noted that the school received an emergency robocall from the Beach Park School District. “We try to keep the children safe and calm on the buses, and when the St. Patrick’s students return from lunch we will pray for (the students in crash) later in the day.” Bosnak said she also will be speaking with her staff about bus safety. “This hits close to home for us.

Jonathan Ross's Bafta script 'edited to avoid offence' By Anita Singh, Showbusiness Editor Last Updated: 8:28AM GMT 07 Feb 2009 Jonathan Ross has spent the week in meetings with Bafta executives to ensure his script does not cause offence Photo: GETTY The presenter has come under fire in previous years for making risque jokes at the expense of the assembled Hollywood stars. This year, BBC bosses are at pains to avoid any hint of scandal and have made it clear that jokes of a sexual or religious nature are strictly off limits. Last year, he shocked the audience by suggesting a risque name for the new James Bond film, and in 2007 he claimed that the nominees were \\"tenser than Mel Gibson in a synagogue\\", a reference to the star's anti-Semitic remark to a police officer. Ross has spent the week in meetings with Bafta executives to ensure his script does not cause offence. A Bafta spokesman said: \\"The script is an ongoing collective process between Jonathan Ross, the show producers and writers and Bafta.\\" However, the presenter is determined to insert a \\"comedy\\" word into his script, as chosen by followers of his Twitter internet blog. He will post the word online before the ceremony begins. As in previous years, the show will be screened on BBC One and BBC Two with a one-hour delay. Ross returned to work last month after serving a three-month ban for his part in the 'Sachsgate' affair. The furore will provide a welcome ratings boost for the BBC, which has seen viewing figures for the Baftas slide in recent years. Last year's coverage drew little more than three million viewers, compared to nearly six million in 2004. Kate Winslet, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are among the stars expected to attend the film ceremony at London's Royal Opera House.

His mother died in 1992 when Nash was fifteen years old, an event which would inspire him to write songs. In 2007 Nash signed a record contract with Def Jam Recordings and began working on his debut studio album Love Hate. The album was produced by The-Dream, his production partner Tricky Stewart, and Los da Mystro, and featured Fabolous and Rihanna. The album was written and recorded in eight days with twelve tracks making the final cut. Released December 11, 2007, on The-Dream's Def Jam imprint Radio Killa Records, the album featured the singles \\"Shawty Is a 10\\", \\"Falsetto\\" and \\"I Luv Your Girl\\" and received generally positive reviews from critics, as Rolling Stone called it \\"one of the most likable R&B records of the year\\" and UrbanMusicReviews.com said that the singer had \\"hit a home run\\".

I ordered soup, which I anticipated being there prior to my meal, which was delivered with my meal. My caprese sandwich was I thought going to be grilled- however was cold, and served on cold toast. Our food had sat in the window for at least 20-30 minutes before being delivered to our table, and it was not busy at all. I tried the beer and cheese soup, which tastes like cheese dip that should have been served with pretzels. I took two bites and couldn't stomach it. The waitress told me she would take it off my check, and then didn't!! When I asked about it, she said I ate half so she left it on- I had 2 bites, and SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS TAKING IT OFF!

Sentence from a movie review: a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the sentence from the movie review stating that the film \\"takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. When a film is said to favor tradition and warmth, it typically means that it emphasizes the importance of traditional values, close relationships, and kindness. These themes are often well-received and appreciated by a wide range of audiences for their feel-good, uplifting, and heartwarming qualities. The use of the phrase \\"takes a stand\\" implies that the filmmaker made a conscious effort to focus on these themes, which can be seen as a commendable and intentional choice. This choice may have resulted in a movie that leaves a lasting positive impression on viewers, evoking a sense of togetherness, empathy, and understanding. Furthermore, when a reviewer highlights such a message in their review, they are usually trying to convey that the film was successful in delivering these important themes and values, indicating that the movie was not only well-made but also emotionally engaging. By drawing attention to the positive aspects of the movie, it is likely that the reviewer views the film favorably. However, it is important to note that this single sentence may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's overall opinion on the movie. The sentence focuses on the themes and values portrayed in the film, but it does not necessarily address other aspects of movie-making, such as plot, character development, cinematography, or editing. While the sentence is indicative of a positive outlook on the film, other aspects of the movie may have also impacted the reviewer's opinion, which may either strengthen or weaken their overall assessment. In conclusion, based on the sentence \\"a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth,\\" it can be inferred that the reviewer viewed this movie positively to a certain extent, particularly in terms of its themes and values. However, it is essential to consider the possibility that other factors may have also contributed to the reviewer's overall assessment of the film, which may warrant a need to examine the rest of the review for a more comprehensive understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The highly anticipated match served as an epitome of intense competition and sheer determination displayed by both the teams, which was mirrored in the even scores. With this hard-earned draw, Truro City carried their mantle of invincibility into the third consecutive match in the League. On the day, Truro City demonstrated a profound sense of tactical strategy and defensive solidity. Every player was visibly soaked in the team's robust philosophy of maintaining an unbeaten run against some fiercely competitive opposition in the league. Treyew Road, which has always been a formidable fortress for the team, once again stood tall in backing them. The match saw both sides showcasing immense resilience and producing a remarkably steadfast defensive masterclass. Notwithstanding the lack of goals, the engagement proved to be an enthralling contest of football that kept spectators on the edge throughout. Truro City, buoyed by their initial success, had come into the game with high hopes of stretching their unbeaten run. Amid heightened expectations, the team's unyielding defense was a sight to behold.

However, Poole Town, the visitors, were in no mood to give up without a fight. Despite playing in an away fixture, they matched their hosts toe-to-toe, showing an admirable application in defense and an equally satisfactory display in the offence. The game also presented several moments of individual brilliance from players on both sides, yet none could break the deadlock. The goalkeepers were, without a doubt, the stars of the show. Both custodians pulled off some splendid saves to keep their respective scorelines untouched. In particular, the Truro City goalkeeper, who showed immense concentration and reflexes to thwart Poole Town's efforts. The match was not bereft of opportunities. However, the lack of precision in the final third from both Truro City and Poole Town inevitably led to the goal-less draw. Despite several penetrating runs and expansive plays, the forwards from each team just fell short of adding the finish to their attempts. Looking ahead, Truro City would feel sanguine about their prospects. Their form signals positive strides on various fronts, most notably at the back, where they have been most unyielding.

While they would have preferred a victory, the continuation of their unbeaten run is undeniably a takeaway that instills confidence in the team going forward.

Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum. Why are you here? What is your purpose? Humans have sought to discover the meaning of life for a very long time. What we and our ancestors have overlooked, however, is that there is no one answer. The meaning of life is different for every individual. Each person has his or her own purpose and distinct path, unique and separate from anyone else's. As you travel your life path, you will be presented with numerous lessons that you will need to learn in order to fulfill that purpose. The lessons you are presented with are specific to you; learning these lessons is the key to discovering and fulfilling the meaning and connection of your own life. As you travel through your lifetime, you may encounter challenging lessons that others don't have to face, while others spend years struggling with challenges that you don't need to deal with. You may never know why you are blessed with a wonderful marriage, while your friends suffer through bitter arguments and painful divorces, just as you cannot be sure why you struggle financially while your peers enjoy abundance. The only thing you can count on for certain is that you will be presented with all the lessons that you specifically need to learn; whether you choose to learn them or not is entirely up to you. The challenge here, therefore, is to align (......) yourself with your own unique path by learning individual lessons.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Kidneys The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure. The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D3, which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a synthetic form). Q: A decline in blood flow to what organs stimulates release of the enzyme renin, in turn stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water?

Walter, a former lawyer, finds work as a farm manager and sends for his family. His wife Jettel has trouble adjusting to life in Africa, although their daughter Regina quickly adapts to her new environment, easily learning the language of the country and showing interest in local culture. Regina soon forms a close friendship with the farm's cook, Owuor, who helped save Walter's life when he had malaria. The only German contact that Jettel has is through a friend of Walter's named SÃ¼sskind, an ex-German who has lived in Africa for years. Jettel asks SÃ¼sskind why he was never married, and he states that he had a habit of falling in love with married women. When war breaks out, the British round up all German citizens, and hold them, whether Jew or gentile, separating men from women.

Q:The answer to the question: What was reissued by EMI in the 1970s? is inside the article: Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books. In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of that which had become the most commonly used drilling fluid by 2009?, using the article: Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Consistent stroke form and aim should be your first priorities when you start to take pool seriously. English is a very useful technique, but it has complex effects and you need consistency to practice it. You'll have trouble narrowing down the effects of English (side spin) if you're not also controlling the amount of overspin and slipping. These effects are determined by the height you strike on the cue ball. Slipping is completely eliminated at 2/5 of the distance between the center and the top of the ball, but in practical terms 1/5 of this distance is often a better measure for optimal control and speed. As long as there is no English, the cue ball will come to a dead stop after a perfect head-on collision. Practice head-on collisions striking the ball with your cue at the midpoint of its horizontal axis. Once you can get the cue ball to stop dead every time, you have enough control to introduce English to your game. There are several types of English, but this article sticks to the most basic form. If your cue hits the cue ball left of center, the ball will spin along this axis — this is \\"left English.\\" When this spinning ball strikes a surface, the spin will cause it to rebound further to the left than a ball with no English. Similarly, striking the right side imparts \\"right English\\" and moves rebounds further to the right. The further from center you are, the more dramatic this effect: 100% English or maximum English means you strike halfway between the center and the edge of the ball. This is the farthest from the center you can strike and reliably avoid miscues. 50% English means you strike halfway between the maximum point and the center (¼ of the way from the center to the edge of the ball). You can use any other percentage of English by striking at different points between the center and the maximum point. When two balls collide, the object ball starts rotating around a particular axis, determined by the angle and the amount of English. If you achieve \\"gearing,\\" this rotation occurs along the axis of movement. In other words, the object ball's motion is not affected by spin. It will travel exactly along the \\"line of centers,\\" or the line drawn between the centers of the two balls at the moment of impact. The term comes from the analogy of two gears meshing smoothly together, transferring the motion perfectly. Once you've aimed your angle shot using the fullness or \\"ghost ball\\" approaches from the last section, you'd like to ensure that the object ball doesn't pick up any funny spin and ruin your shot. Here's where a chart can save you a lot of trial and error. All numbers below are for \\"outside English,\\" meaning you move the cue to the side of the cue ball farther from the object ball. If the cut angle is 15º, use slightly more than 20% English. (Remember, the cut angle is the angle between the cue ball's original path and the path of the object ball.) If the cut angle is 30º, use 40% English. If the cut angle is 45º, use about 55% English. If the cut angle is 60º, use about 70% English. As the cut angle approaches 90º, increase English to 80%. If you use less English than the \\"gearing\\" amount listed in the last step, the cue ball will slide forward during the collision, transferring side spin to the object ball. The object ball will move slightly to the right of the expected cut angle. If you use more English than the gearing amount, the object ball will move slightly to the left of the expected cut angle instead. This effect is called cut induced throw: the cut angle transferred a spin which threw the ball off the expected path. You can use this to your advantage to make seemingly impossible shots. If your only clear shot would put the ball slightly too far to the right, increase the amount of outside English to throw the ball into the pocket. Summary:","completion":"1. Develop a consistent stroke form and aim. 2. Practice controlling the amount of overspin and slipping by controlling the height at which you strike the cue ball. 3. Master head-on collisions with the cue ball by striking at the midpoint of its horizontal axis. 4. Introduce English into your game by striking the cue ball left or right of the center for left and right English. 5.

Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth. Archaeologists studied data about human settlements. One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't. Which village had more people that were hunters? A:","completion":"Establishing which village had more hunters requires a understanding of the historical context, human evolution, and lifestyle adaptations that took place. Human way of life was significantly different between 100,000 years ago and 9,000 years ago. Village R, the 100,000 year-old settlement located in Africa, was likely inhabited by humans during an era characterized by hunter-gatherer societies. As such, it is likely that hunting was the predominant means of sustenance and survival for inhabitants during this period. This lifestyle involved active hunting of wild animals and gathering resources such as fruits and plants to sustain life. With limited technological tools, this lifestyle necessitated that most, if not all, able-bodied individuals engage in hunting activities. On the other hand, Village N, being about 9,000 years old, might have existed during the Neolithic period, transitioning from a hunter-gatherer society to an early agrarian set-up - also known as the agricultural revolution. This period marked a significant shift in the manner humans acquired food, moving from nomadic hunting to a more settled farming lifestyle. Therefore, although some individuals in this community would have likely continued hunting, an increasing number would have been involved in farming, livestock rearing and other agri-allied activities, caused by the transition to a more sedentary lifestyle. Based on this historical context and lifestyle adaptations, it is thus likely that Village R, the 100,000 year-old settlement, had a larger proportion of its population involved in hunting, as the settlement existed in a time where hunting was a primary means for food and survival. Although Village N undoubtedly had hunters, as hunting did not disappear immediately with the advent of agriculture, the shift towards farming would have reduced the proportion of the population engaged in hunting compared to that of Village R. This hypothesis would still require evidence from archaeology and anthropology studies such as artifact typology, faunal or botanical remains, isotope analysis, and other evidence associated with the subsistence strategies of the past human societies to further substantiate this inference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

LONDON (CNNMoney) Music mogul Jay Z has purchased what could be described as the flashiest champagne company in the world -- Armand de Brignac. The Armand de Brignac champagne company -- which sells its shiny gold bottles for about 300 each -- has long been favored by the rap artist and was featured prominently in one of his music videos back in 2006. He's often seen in pictures sipping the drink with his wife Beyonce Knowles, and the couple famously hosted a fundraiser for President Obama that featured a wall lined with hundreds of Armand de Brignac bottles. The owner of the brand -- New York-based Sovereign Brands -- confirmed the sale this week. The price of the deal was not disclosed. The champagne -- also called \\"Ace of Spades\\" -- is crafted and marketed by a family-run vineyard in France that traces its roots back to 1763. The company employs fewer than 20 people. Jay Z used to be a massive fan of Cristal, but that changed in 2006 when The Economist published disparaging comments from the head of the company that makes the champagne, Frederic Rouzaud. \\"What can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it,\\" Rouzaud told The Economist, when asked if hip-hop artists were tarnishing the high-end brand. When Jay Z heard of the comments, he immediately stopped sipping Cristal and quickly switched to Armand de Brignac. \\"We used their brand as a signifier of luxury and they got free advertising and credibility every time we mentioned it,\\" he wrote in his 2010 book \\"Decoded.\\" \\"We were trading cachet. But they didn't see it that way.\\" Related: The favorite brands among hip-hop legends The 44-year-old New Yorker, born Shawn Carter, rose to fame through his music and now has business interests in fashion, entertainment and sports. Forbes ranks him among the most powerful celebrities in the world, alongside Oprah Winfrey and LeBron James. But his wife Beyonce tops the Forbes ranking and was recently named the top-earning woman in the music industry after making 115 million in 2014. ||||| Earlier this week, media outlets around the world started trumpeting Jay Z's latest boardroom triumph. \\"Jay Z buys Armand de Brignac champagne brand,\\" blared the BBC. \\"Jay Z likes 300 champagne. So he buys the company,\\" proclaimed CNN. Problem is, this piece of 'news' isn't actually new. As I reported in my Jay Z biography, Empire State of Mind, the Brooklyn-born mogul has had a financial interest in Armand de Brignac since its inception--helping boost his net worth to 520 million, by FORBES' latest estimate--as the 300-per-bottle champagne has become one of hip-hop's favorite brands. The story really begins way back in 2006, when Frederic Rouzaud, the manager of the company that makes Cristal champagne, put a grape-stomping foot in his mouth when a reporter from the Economist asked his thoughts about the popularity of Cristal among rappers. \\"What can we do?\\" Rouzaud replied. \\"We can't forbid people from buying it.\\" Many in the hip-hop world took the comments as a major sleight; some sensed racism, including Jay Z. So he called for a boycott of Cristal and stopped rapping about it. Later that year, a mysterious gold bottle appeared in his video for \\"Show Me What You Got.\\" The public was soon introduced to the new bubbly, Armand de Brignac, nicknamed Ace of Spades after its bold logo. Or at least, it was billed as new--sort of. Representatives from Cattier, the French company that makes the champagne, described it as a wine that was \\"making its North American debut this year, after enjoying success as a premium, high-end brand in France.\\" Its gold bottle bore a striking resemblance to Antique Gold, a brand discontinued by Cattier in 2006 priced at about 60. Though Armand de Brignac has since earned its share of praise (frequently from Jay Z in his own songs), some wine critics have given it ratings much lower than Cristal and closer to Veuve Clicquot--a fine champagne to be sure, but one planted firmly in the same 60 price range as Antique Gold. New York wine buyer Lyle Fass was less kind, dubbing Armand de Brignac \\"the biggest rip-off in the history of wine.\\" While reporting Empire State of Mind, I decided to travel to France to get to the bottom of the story. I arranged a meeting with the head of Cattier at the company's beautiful headquarters in the tiny village of Chigny-Les-Roses and headed across the pond. Upon my arrival, a guide took me on a tour of Cattier's 150-year-old cellars, which served as part of a network of underground shelters during the second World War. There, I saw thousands of gold bottles glowing faintly in the damp dark--each waiting to be stamped with an Armand de Brignac spade logo that would differentiate it from Antique Gold. The company's commercial director told me about Cattier's history and explained that Jay Z had discovered Armand de Brignac in a New York wine shop. He insisted that there was no \\"financial involvement,\\" and that, more or less, Jay Z simply liked the champagne so much that he decided to feature it in one of his videos. But Armand de Brignac didn't ship to the United States until the fall of 2006--months after the gold bottle appeared in his \\"Show Me What You Got\\" video. When I confronted the folks at Cattier about this, they backtracked. \\"There's a misunderstanding regarding how Jay saw the bottle,\\" a company publicist said. \\"It was in New York ... but not in a store.\\" Upon my return to the United States, I found the story unraveling even further. A prominent liquor executive told me Jay Z owned a piece of Armand de Brignac brand, along with Cattier and a company called Sovereign Brands. A wine distributor and a record executive confirmed this as well; one of my sources pegged the value of Jay Z's stake at 50 million. After Empire State of Mind came out in 2011, even Jay Z's friend, marketing guru Steve Stoute, finally acknowledged that Jay Z had a financial interest in Armand de Brignac in his 2012 book The Tanning of America. So why are so many outlets now reporting that Jay Z bought some, or all, of the Armand de Brignac brand this week--and portraying it as a new development? The burst of publicity can be traced to a press release put out via a Canadian newswire yesterday morning. \\"We are proud to announce that Sovereign Brands, a New York-based wine and spirits company owned by the Berish family, has sold its interest in the Armand de Brignac ('Ace of Spades') Champagne brand to a new company led by the globally-renowned Shawn 'Jay Z' Carter,\\" the statement read. Neither of the publicists listed in the release returned my emails requesting comment yesterday, and none of the financial details of the agreement have been released. But what happens seems fairly straightforward--Jay Z added to his existing share in the Armand de Brignac brand by buying out Sovereign's stake. As one source with knowledge of the situation told me, Jay Z saw a chance to purchase more of something he thought would be worth more in the future than it is today, so he did. He was investing, essentially, in himself. What remains a question is how so many outlets, even the New York Times, completely missed the fact that Jay Z already had a financial interest in Armand de Brignac. The answer, it seems, is that they simply gobbled up the press release and didn't dig any deeper. In a way, it's a classic Jay Z outcome. He never commented publicly on my findings--though he did tell me, \\"That book was horrible!\\" in my only interaction with him--and sure enough, many people continued to believe that he was simply rapping about Armand de Brignac because he liked the taste. Now, with the cat long out of the bag, he makes the news official, earning praise around the world for his business acumen--and deservedly so. \\"Everybody should take a lesson who wants to sell wine that sucks,\\" Fass told me. \\"Because it is probably the most brilliant marketing in the history of wine.\\" For more about the business of music--and to read the full story of Armand de Brignac--check out my Jay Z biography Empire State of Mind.

What are the supernatural elements used in the poem The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and how do they add to the events that place in the poem? Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPTIONS: 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"1) No. The two questions are different in their focus and content about the poem \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. While the first question deals with the specific action of the protagonist shooting the albatross and its reason, the second question revolves around supernatural elements present in the poem and their impact on the events that take place. Now that we have established the difference in the questions, let's answer them separately: 1) Why did the Ancient Mariner shoot the albatross? In the poem, the Ancient Mariner shoots the albatross, a sea bird associated with good luck and seen as an omen of fair winds to sailors. There isn't a clear reason given for this act. However, some analysis provided that the protagonist committed the action impulsively, possibly driven by youthful arrogance, a desire for control over nature, or even boredom. By shooting the albatross, the Ancient Mariner triggers the tragic series of events that follow, including the isolation of the ship, the suffering of the crew, and a curse imposed upon himself. The poem serves as a cautionary tale, reflecting the consequences of senseless destruction and the need for an individual's moral and spiritual growth, and a deeper respect for nature and its creatures. 2) What are the supernatural elements used in the poem The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and how do they add to the events that take place in the poem? The Rime of the Ancient Mariner contains a number of supernatural elements that blend reality with mysticism and magnify the overall impact of the story. These elements help emphasize the severity of the Mariner's actions and the enormity of the moral and spiritual journey he undergoes. Some prominent examples of the supernatural elements are: a) The Albatross: The albatross is a symbol of nature's power and benevolence. Its mysterious appearance brought good luck and favorable winds to the ship, and its death is followed by disastrous consequences. Although a real bird, it gains mythical and supernatural significance as an embodiment of spiritual and moral values. b) Life-in-Death and Death: These two ghostly figures, which embody life and death, appear to play a dice game to determine the fate of the Mariner and the crew. Their ethereal presence intensifies the narrative's otherworldly atmosphere, and their game adds an additional layer of uncertainty, as the Mariner's ultimate fate hangs by a thread. c) The reanimated crew: After the shipmates' deaths, their corpses spring back to life to perform the tasks required to sail the ship. This unsettling supernatural element serves as an unnerving depiction of the Mariner's guilt and a reminder of his responsibility for his crew's demise. d) The curse lifted by the water-snakes: After the Ancient Mariner's spiritual transformation, which consists of him realizing the beauty and spiritual value of all living beings, the curse is lifted. This event, which occurs when he blesses the water-snakes, marks the beginning of his redemption arc and symbolizes the power of love, empathy, and respect for nature. These supernatural elements contribute to the poem's mythical and allegorical quality, ultimately emphasizing the importance of moral and spiritual growth and the consequences of destructive actions. Furthermore, they serve to accentuate the enthralling nature of the poem and captivate the reader's senses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I've identified the keywords as \\"dirt\\", \\"gutter\\", and \\"rubber hits it regularly\\". Step 2: Evaluate the choices based on the keywords Now, I will evaluate all the options based on these keywords. - Race track: Race tracks can have dirt, and rubber (from tires of racing cars) hits it regularly. However, gutters are typically not found on a race track, making this an unlikely choice. - Bed: Beds are not commonly associated with dirt or gutters, and there is no context where rubber hits a bed regularly. Hence, this does not meet any of the criteria provided. - Ground: Ground is a very broad term and it could have dirt and could be a surface where rubber hits regularly (like rubber soles from shoes). But it's less likely for a gutter to be associated directly with the ground, making this not the best-fit choice. - Street: Streets are places where you find gutters, they are often dirty, and rubber (from car or bike tires) hits it regularly. This choice fits all the keywords and the context of the question. - Subway: Subways can be dirty, but rubber doesn't hit it regularly (the wheels of a subway train are typically made of steel, not rubber). Also, gutters are not typically found in a subway. Therefore, this choice does not meet all the conditions laid out by the question. Step 3: Choose the answer Based on this evaluation, the choice \\"street\\" meets all the keywords and the context provided in the question. Therefore, the answer is \\"street\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Use the following highlights to write an article: Cayne Miceli, 43, died after being placed in five-point restraints in Orleans Parish Prison in January 2009. She had been in hospital for a severe asthma attack and attacked a security guard when staff tried to discharge her. Jail staff tied her down following a suicide attempt. She was found without a pulse four hours later and later died in hospital. Her family brought a wrongful death lawsuit. They have settled for three payments of 600,000. Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding the Story of Cayne Miceli Once upon a time, there was a woman named Cayne Miceli, who was 43 years old. In January 2009, something really sad happened to her. She had been feeling really bad because she had a severe asthma attack. An asthma attack is when you find it hard to breathe because your air pipes going into your lungs get tighter. What should have been a place of healing, the hospital, turned into a scary situation. She was at the hospital to get better, but when the doctors said she could leave, she didn't want to because she still didn't feel well. This made her upset, so much so that she ended up having an argument with a security guard there. A security guard is like a police officer but they watch over a specific place, like a hospital or school. Because of what happened at the hospital, people thought she might try to hurt herself, so she ended up in a place called Orleans Parish Prison. They tied her down, using something called five-point restraints. This is a way to help keep someone from moving too much and possibly hurting themselves or others. It's like being given a big, tight hug, but not a very comfortable one. Sadly, about four hours later, Cayne was found in a really bad state. She didn't have a pulse, which means her heart wasn't beating the way it should. She was taken back to the hospital but she passed away there. Cayne's family was very upset about what happened. They thought the people at the jail did not take appropriate care of Cayne, so they started a wrongful death lawsuit. A wrongful death lawsuit is like telling the judge, \\"We believe this person died because these people didn't do their job properly, and we want them to pay for it.\\" After some time, the family and the people they were suing decided to settle the lawsuit. This means they came to an agreement and decided to stop fighting in court. They agreed to pay Cayne’s family three payments of 600,000 as compensation for their loss. This is a sad story, but it's important to remember that everyone can make mistakes, even grown-ups like doctors or jail staff. It's always important to learn from these mistakes and find ways to stop them from happening again, so no other families have to go through what Cayne's family did."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Mr Trump signed an executive order placing a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim countries on Monday. New York maintains the new directive is a ban on Muslims while Washington contends it is harmful to the state. Massachusetts later joined them. Minnesota and Oregon are reportedly also filing lawsuits seeking to block the ban, which begins on 16 March. The White House has said it is \\"very confident\\" the ban will win in court. The renewed legal challenges come after attorneys for Hawaii filed a lawsuit against the revised order on Wednesday night, arguing it would harm its Muslim population, tourism and foreign students. Hawaii was among other states that had previously sued over the president's initial travel ban, but the legal challenge was halted until courts ruled on similar cases across the country. The revised ban bars new visas for people from: Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen. It also temporarily blocks all refugees. The previous order, which Mr Trump signed in January, was blocked in federal courts and sparked mass protests as well as confusion at airports. But critics maintain the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims. \\"President Trump's latest executive order is a Muslim Ban by another name, imposing policies and protocols that once again violate the Equal Protection Clause and Establishment Clause of the United State Constitution,\\" said New York Attorney General Eric T Schneiderman after announcing his legal challenge. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who was the first to sue over the original ban, said he would ask a federal judge to rule that the temporary restraining halting the first travel ban \\"remains in effect\\". \\"We're asserting that the president cannot unilaterally declare himself free of the court's restraining order and injunction,\\" he said. Though the White House has faced mounting criticism over its immigration orders, Trump supporters say the president is fulfilling his campaign promises to protect Americans. Citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the other six countries on the original 27 January order, will once more be subject to a 90-day travel ban. Iraq has been taken off the banned list because its government has boosted visa screening and data sharing, White House officials said. The new directive says refugees already approved by the State Department can enter the US. It also lifts an indefinite ban on all Syrian refugees. Green Card holders (legal permanent residents of the US) from the named countries will not be affected. The new order does not give priority to religious minorities, unlike the previous directive. Critics of the Trump administration had argued that this was an unlawful policy showing preference to Christian refugees. Summary:","completion":"President Trump signed a revised executive order placing a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim countries - Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen - and temporarily blocking all refugees. Several states, including New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have opposed the order, stating it discriminates against Muslims and violates the US Constitution. Despite legal challenges, the White House remains confident that the ban will win in court.

During the weather report on the news he lied. The weatherman said it would snow in July. Many angry viewers called into the station. Hypothesis: The viewers were angry because the weatherman lied since he was going to be fired.","completion":"Based on the provided context, the hypothesis that the viewers were angry because the weatherman lied since he was going to be fired seems plausible. However, it is important to analyze the overall situation and break it down into different elements to provide a more comprehensive understanding. 1. The weatherman was told he was going to be fired: This information suggests that the weatherman was already in a difficult position at work. He might have been unhappy with his employment situation or even felt betrayed by the company he worked for. This could have had a negative influence on his behavior and decision-making abilities. 2. The weatherman became very angry: His emotional state after receiving the news of his impeding dismissal was negative. Anger is a powerful emotion that can lead people to act impulsively and make decisions that they may regret later on. This emotional response may have also contributed to the weatherman's decision to lie during the weather report. 3. The weatherman lied about the weather: In his anger, the weatherman decided to lie during the weather report, predicting snow in July, which is a highly unlikely occurrence. This deliberate deception might have been motivated by various reasons, including an impulsive reaction to the negative news or a desire to create chaos as a form of revenge against his employers and their viewers. 4. Viewers became angry: The audience reacted strongly to the false weather report and called into the station to express their dissatisfaction. This response can be attributed to different factors such as betrayal (due to the trust the viewers placed in the weatherman's predictions), inconvenience (possible disruptions in their plans due to the impression of an impending snowstorm), and a general sense of disbelief at the bizarre prediction. Taking all these factors into account, the hypothesis that the viewers were angry because the weatherman lied since he was going to be fired appears to hold water. The weatherman's emotions and career situation may have contributed to his actions, and these actions led to the viewers' frustration. However, it is important to note that this is only a hypothesis derived from limited information. To conclusively state that this hypothesis is accurate, further evidence and context would be needed. For instance, understanding the underlying reasons behind the weatherman's dismissal or any previous instances of dishonesty might provide more insight into his actions and the viewers' reactions. While the hypothesis seems plausible based on the given context, a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and its various nuances would lend better support to the statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Vinegar contains acetic acid, which effectively kills weeds. Keep in mind that vinegar is non-selective and will kill any living plant it touches, not just weeds. White vinegar can be used alone, or you can add additional ingredients to the vinegar to make an even stronger solution. Avoid using vinegar on or near your lawn, since it will kill the grass. Vinegar will raise the acidity of your soil. Before planting, test the pH of your soil and adjust it accordingly, if needed. Use horticultural vinegar with 20% acetic acid for increased effectiveness between pavers or on patios. The extra acidity will affect the pH balance of your soil and other plants. Lemon juice contains high levels of citric acid and can be effective when used with the white vinegar. If you want to try it, simply mix the lemon juice in with your 2 c (400 mL) of white distilled vinegar. Dish soap can be a helpful addition to vinegar when you're dealing with weeds that have a waxy coating or a “hairy” surface, like dandelion and crabgrass. The fuzzy exterior blocks the absorption of vinegar, but dish soap will penetrate the outer protective layer of the plant and help the mixture stick to the leaves. You can use dish soap or dishwasher detergent in liquid or powder form. Dish soap can be used in conjunction with a lemon-vinegar mixture, but a soap and vinegar solution will be very effective. Isopropyl alcohol can be very effective when mixed with white vinegar or even when used alone. You can also use cheap gin to achieve similar results. Simply add the alcohol of your choice to the white vinegar and stir it thoroughly. You can use alcohol, vinegar, and lemon juice together in one mixture, but a solution that strong may cause soil damage. You can use the full-strength solution if your weed problem is severe, but this is typically too strong. A 50/50 mix diluted with water will be very effective on weeds without traumatizing the area where it's used. Full strength solutions may penetrate the soil and kill the roots of plants other than weeds. They can also disturb crucial microorganisms in the soil. Use a funnel to transfer the solution to a spray bottle, then replace the nozzle tightly. Apply the solution to the weeds and monitor the results for 24 hours. If needed, you can apply more solution, but you probably won't need to. Set the nozzle to \\"stream\\" rather than \\"spray\\" if the weeds are growing close to plants that you don't want to kill. Don't forget -- weed killer does not discriminate. It will kill any plant it comes in contact with, so use it carefully!

Question: On which coast does the battle take place? Movie plot title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Movie plot: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \\"Mind Makers,\\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s.

Review: It's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you, always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how tough that must be. That's the premise here. Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for simply being the limelight-hogging, fame-hungry, slightly creepy guy that Fred would want to portray him as. Then, wouldn't you know it, Fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to Christmas. And hilarity and life lessons ensue. Well, that's what should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie featuring a few good moments of Vaughn's patented fast-talking, a ridiculously out-of-nowhere music video moment, Kevin Spacey playing an auditor out to close down Santa's operation (and he's one of the weakest baddies I have seen in some time), not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit (to be fair, he's a highlight though) and a movie that's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time. Rachel Weisz is along for the ride too, as is Kathy Bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker. Outside of Vaughn's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem. David Dobkin's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p Christmas card that you send the auntie you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding. Nope, we get a burnt, bland lump with too much sugar on top. Forget this and stick the hilarious Elf on again if you want a great, modern Christmas comedy.

The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is set to travel to the U.S. today with her ex-husband, nearly a week after one of their reign of terror came to an end. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who now lives in Dagestan, Russia, said in an emotional telephone interview that she believes her sons, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, have been framed for the bombings. The suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities there - and will also travel to the U.S. to be interviewed by investigators. Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaeva launched into a bizarre rant in which she claims she does not care if she or her youngest son are killed by U.S. authorities. while her youngest,","completion":"Dzhokhar, remains in custody facing charges of using a weapon of mass destruction, which caused 3 deaths and injured more than 260 people during the April 15 bombings in 2013. The older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a police shootout on April 19, only days after the tragic attack during the annual iconic race in the heart of Boston. Upon arrival in the United States, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva and Anzor Tsarnaev are expected to face a barrage of questions from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies seeking answers and further insights into the motives behind the attack. Despite the incriminating evidence against their sons, the couple passionately maintains that their children were innocent victims of an elaborate conspiracy by the American government. Throughout the intense media attention surrounding the case, the Tsarnaev family has expressed a variety of controversial opinions and conspiracy theories in an attempt to deflect the blame from their sons. Some family members have even gone so far as to claim that the bombs used in the attack were merely \\"fake\\" and that the entire incident was staged by the US government to justify the increased surveillance and security measures that followed the tragic event. Boston breathed a collective sigh of relief when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother, was captured after a massive manhunt that left the city and its surrounding areas in a state of panic for days. His capture provided an opportunity for authorities to uncover more about the motivations, radicalization, and planning behind the heinous act that had torn the city apart. Meanwhile, Tsarnaeva's bizarre rant may spark fear among citizens who worry that the mother of the two suspects might show sympathy for her children's hate-filled actions, despite overwhelming evidence against them. There are also concerns that her presence in the United States could incite further tension and hostility, as the country continues to grapple with its recovery and healing process. As more facts and evidence continue to emerge, the grave implications of the Boston Marathon bombings have had far-reaching effects on not only the victims and their families but also the nation as a whole. It has raised questions about national security, the influence of radical ideologies, and the ability of intelligence agencies to identify potential threats before they can cause harm. In these challenging times, it is up to all individuals, citizens, and government bodies to work collaboratively in maintaining vigilance and fostering understanding between diverse communities. It is only through unity, resilience and a shared sense of purpose that tragedies like these can be prevented in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This statement refers to a comprehensive breakdown of minor planets within a specific range (in this case, 246001 through 247000). Minor planets, also commonly known as asteroids or small Solar System bodies, are celestial objects that orbit around the Sun. They are smaller than planets, and their classification can include asteroids, dwarf planets, Kuiper Belt objects, trans-Neptunian objects, and centaurs. The majority of these minor planets are situated in the inner Solar System, particularly within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The enumeration of minor planets originates from the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which is part of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The MPC is responsible for assigning provisional designations to newly discovered minor planets, tracking their orbits, and providing accurate data for researchers and observers. A list, such as \\"List of minor planets: 246001-247000,\\" would comprise the specific details of each minor planet within that range, offering extensive data on each celestial object. This information could include the following: 1. Provisional and permanent designations: These serve as unique identifiers for minor planets, allowing for easy reference and organization within the scientific community. 2. Discovery date and location: The date and location of each minor planet's discovery provide historical and geographical context for researchers. 3. Discoverer(s): The individual(s) or team responsible for the discovery of a minor planet are credited, recognizing their contributions to the field of astronomy. 4. Orbital characteristics: This encompasses the parameters that define a minor planet's path around the Sun, such as its semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital period, and inclination. 5. Physical properties: This data covers the dimensions, mass, rotation period, and density of a minor planet, providing vital information for astronomers studying its composition and structure. 6. Absolute magnitude and albedo: These aspects refer to the brightness and the reflection coefficient of a minor planet, allowing for estimations of its size and surface properties.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Sentence 2: Sunlight shone as expectedly upon the world. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is true as well. Both sentences express that sunlight is shining on the world, although they differ in terms of detail and description. The first sentence provides a more detailed and vivid description of the situation. It emphasizes that sunlight is not only shining on the world but doing so normally or as expected. Additionally, the sentence offers more specific elements related to the visual appearance of the sky - gaudy blue - and the fact that the observer can see cracks in the sky that are smoothing out. The mention of the roof implies that the observer is likely situated indoors or under a sheltered area, taking in the scene outside. In contrast, the second sentence conveys similar information but in a much simpler and more concise manner. It states that sunlight is shining on the world, as expected. It does not provide any information about the sky’s appearance or the observer's location. However, the core idea - that sunlight is shining on the world - is present in both sentences. Since the first sentence's truth leads us to acknowledge that sunlight shines normally on the world, we can conclude that the second sentence is also true.

Examine the first sentence: \\"Even more surprising than how boring this book was is the fact that some people actually loved it.\\" This sentence clearly has a negative tone, as the reviewer is stating that they found the book boring and are surprised that others enjoyed it. 3. Analyze the following sentences: \\"It had absolutely no depth or insight as to motivation, character, or more importantly, the gravity of the holocaust.\\" Again, the statement is negative, as the reviewer believes the book lacked depth, insight, and failed to grasp the importance of its subject matter. 4. Check the final sentences: \\"I'll never forget the glorious moment I finished it.

Depending on the illness or condition affecting the individual, various symptoms, reactions, or outcomes may occur if no medical treatment is provided. If a sick person is not treated, their condition can manifest itself in many different ways. In the given options, \\"throw up\\" or vomiting is a common response to various illnesses, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal system, such as food poisoning or stomach flu. This reaction serves as a way for the body to expel harmful substances and protect itself from further damage. On the other hand, some individuals may eventually get better (option A) without treatment due to their immune system's ability to fight off infections or illnesses. However, it is essential to seek medical guidance to determine if treatment is necessary or if the body can recover on its own. Option B, \\"train,\\" is not suitable since engaging in physical activity or training is generally not recommended while a person is sick, especially if they are experiencing fever, fatigue, or other symptoms that could be worsened with exertion. Option C, \\"battle cancer,\\" is not an appropriate answer to the question since cancer is a specific illness and requires specialized treatment based on various factors like the type and stage of cancer, overall health, and other considerations. Additionally, not all sick individuals are suffering from cancer. Finally, option E, \\"take medicine,\\" is not a valid response either, as it involves a form of treatment. The question asks what a sick person would do if they are NOT treated. Taking medication would be a treatment option that contradicts the premise of the question.

The 59-year-old \\"America's Next Top Model\\" judge told Entertainment Tonight the 77-year-old TV legend raped her more than two decades ago. Dickinson claimed that in 1982, Cosby invited her to Lake Tahoe, where he was performing, to discuss a job he had offered her, as well as advice on her singing career. She said that after she arrived in Tahoe, the two had dinner, and then when the two returned to her room, Cosby gave her “wine and a pill.” “The next morning I woke up and I wasn’t wearing my pajamas,” she said. “And I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man.” “Before I woke up in the morning, the last thing I remember was Bill Cosby, in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me.” When asked if she ever confronted the TV star about what happened, she said that she had not, and that Cosby had never broached it with her. “I’ll tell you why I’m doing this,\\" Dickinson said. “Because it’s the right thing to do, and it happened to me, and this is the true story.” Dickinson is the self-proclaimed \\"world's first supermodel\\" who claims to have coined the term during her covergirl heyday in the 70s and 80s. She's remained in the public eye over the past decade by appearing on several reality TV shows, including \\"The Surreal Life,\\" \\"The Janice Dickinson Modelling Agency,\\" and \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,\\" where she confronted addictions to prescription pills, and plastic surgery. Dickinson is the third accuser to come forward since comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a stand-up routine in Philadelphia last month. The latest accuser before Dickinson, Joan Tarshis, went public over the weekend. In an essay published Sunday on the Hollywood Elsewhere website and an interview with CNN, Tarshis claimed that Cosby raped her in the autumn 1969, when she was a starstruck 19-year-old aspiring actress. Tarshis claimed Cosby lured her to his bungalow at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex on him. Tarshis said Cosby attacked her again days later at the Sherry Netherland hotel, after she accompanied him to a performance he gave at The Westbury Music Theater on Long Island. Last week, another woman, Barbara Bowman, published a first-person story in The Washington Post alleging that Cosby raped her in 1985 when she was 17. Bowman's story hit some of the same notes as Tarshis'; she said Cosby drugged her at his New York City brownstone and she recalled coming to \\"in my panties and a man's t-shirt, and Cosby was looming over me.\\" Both Joan Tarshis (l.) and Barbara Bowman have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby. Cosby has never been criminally charged for any of the alleged sexual assaults. However, he did settle a civil case in 2006 brought by Temple University employee Andrea Constand who originally claimed he drugged and groped her in his mansion. Cosby's lawyer John Schmitt issued a statement that dismissed Tarshis and Bowman's claims as \\"decade-old, discredited\\" allegations. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Write an article based on this summary: Just over 18 months ago, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service nailed its colours to the mast over Syria, making clear that fighting in Syria would almost certainly lead to the criminal dock back home.","completion":"Title: Criminal Repercussions: A Close Look at the Legal Consequences of Fighting in Syria for UK Citizens Introduction In the past few years, the world has seen an alarming rise in the number of foreign individuals joining various militia and fighting groups in Syria. One of the countries that took a firm stand against such acts is the United Kingdom, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stating that British citizens participating in the Syrian conflict will likely face legal consequences upon their return. This article will outline the reasons behind this decision, the legal stance held by the UK, and the potential ramifications faced by those who defy this warning. The Crown Prosecution Service's Warning In October 2019, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service made a strong statement condemning Britons who participate in the Syrian conflict. According to the CPS, fighting in Syria, regardless of the side taken, is deemed as an offence under UK law. This means that any UK citizen who fights in Syria will be investigated and possibly charged with criminal offences upon returning home. The announcement solidified the UK's commitment to combating terrorism and maintaining national security – a top priority for the British government. This stance also aligns with the country's efforts to deter young people from being radicalized or recruitment by extremist groups. Legal Implications To understand the legal implications, it is essential to highlight the key legislation targeting those who engage in conflicts abroad. Under the Terrorism Act 2000, it is illegal for British citizens to participate in terrorist-related activities outside the UK. Specifically, Section 5 of the Act criminalizes the preparation or instigation of terrorism abroad, stating that individuals found to have participated in acts of terror in foreign countries may face prosecution. Furthermore, the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 expands upon the 2000 Act, strengthening the UK's response to the broad range of terrorist threats. This newer legislation has increased penalties for criminal offences related to terrorism and allows for the prosecution of individuals who travel or plan to travel abroad with the intention of joining any terrorist organizations. Possible Charges While the exact charges applicable to a returned UK citizen would depend on the specifics of their case, common charges could include membership in a proscribed (banned) organization, attending a place used for terrorist training, or involvement in terrorist funding. For instance, if a UK national travelled to Syria to join a group like ISIS (Daesh), they may be charged with membership in a proscribed organization, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment upon conviction. Potential Ramifications The ramifications of these charges and penalties go beyond the legal aspect. There are several social consequences UK citizens must understand if they choose to fight in the Syrian conflict. First, they may face distrust, alienation, and difficulties reintegrating into society. Additionally, they may struggle to find or keep employment, as employers may be hesitant to hire individuals with terrorism-related convictions. Moreover, those convicted may lose access to social benefits or housing assistance, further complicating their efforts to regain a semblance of a normal life. Furthermore, the individual's friends and family may endure significant emotional distress and become targets of intrusive investigations by security and law enforcement agencies. Conclusion The UK's Crown Prosecution Service has demonstrated a clear intent to prosecute those who disobey its warning against engaging in any form of conflict in Syria. With the potential risk of lengthy prison sentences and various personal, social, and financial consequences, citizens must weigh these potential costs against their intention to participate in the Syrian conflict. The British government's stance on this matter is strong and unwavering to ensure national security, deter extremist recruitment, and maintain societal harmony. In conclusion, the UK aims to prevent its citizens from participating in the Syrian conflict by implementing clear legal ramifications. The potential consequences of engaging in combat abroad are dire – from criminal charges and imprisonment to societal backlash and the disruption of the individual's life. Therefore, it is imperative that all UK citizens understand the risks involved and take heed of the government's warnings to avoid compounding this already complex and multifaceted global issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried.

Here is a question about this article: In 1903, Brigham Young Academy was dissolved, and was replaced by two institutions: Brigham Young High School, and Brigham Young University. (The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant \\"Y\\" that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus.) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer. Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land from Provo called \\"Temple Hill\\". After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial. Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a \\"religious seminary\\". However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and become well renowned in their fields.

From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation., what would be the answer ?

Background: Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy, a beauty salon owner, and Richard Shelton, a used car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state. Context: Shelton released his fourth studio album, Pure BS, in early 2007. Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles--\\"Don't Make Me\\" and \\"The More I Drink\\"--were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition Nashville Star, and later on Clash of the Choirs. Pure BS was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Buble's hit single \\"Home\\". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July. \\"Home\\" was followed in August 2008 by the single \\"She Wouldn't Be Gone\\", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. \\"She Wouldn't Be Gone\\" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, Startin' Fires, which has also produced the single \\"I'll Just Hold On.\\" This album also includes \\"Bare Skin Rug,\\" a duet with Lambert. It was produced by Scott Hendricks, except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another (\\"I Don't Care\\", which carried over from Pure BS) was produced by Braddock. After \\"I'll Just Hold On\\" fell off the chart in October 2009, Blake Shelton released a duet with Trace Adkins titled \\"Hillbilly Bone\\". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, Hillbilly Bone, released on March 2, 2010 through Reprise Records Nashville. After \\"Hillbilly Bone\\" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of \\"All About Tonight\\", the lead-off single to his EP of the same name. In September, he released the second single from All About Tonight, \\"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\\", his 18th single release. He released his first greatest hits album, Loaded: The Best of Blake Shelton in November 2010. Shelton was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry during the September 28, 2010 \\"Country Comes Home\\" concert celebrating reopening of the Grand Ole Opry House after the Cumberland River flooded the Opry House in May 2010. The formal invitation was extended on his Twitter account and was announced by Opry star Trace Adkins. He was formally inducted by Adkins at the October 23, 2010 Opry performance. Shelton recorded the title track for the remake of Footloose released on October 14, 2011. Shelton appeared on the 44th Annual Country Music Awards on November 10, 2010 where he performed \\"All About Tonight\\" and won Male Vocalist of the Year.

Estimate your total annual receipts. Choose from: +It can be helpful to leave more than one bank account open for your business expense accounting. In this way, you can choose the correct one and complete the balance (and fine print, if necessary) for each transaction.. +In an official merchant account, you should be able to check annual receipts for the period of the credit card expiration-typically four years. You do not have to specify your exact year because it is your business's annual annual income.. +Always check the annual receipts from each paycheck you make. For example, if you make 2 , 000 a month, 5 , 000 a month would be your annual receipts.. +The merchant service provider will use this information to determine if you will be a worthwhile customer. You need not supply the provider with an exact figure; estimating the amount of money you take in is enough.. Answer:","completion":"Getting a credit card machine involves several crucial steps and a clear understanding of your business's financial flow. Initially, you need to open a business checking account. This account serves as the primary connector between your business's cash flow and the merchant service provider who will be handling your credit card transactions. This account does not specifically have to be opened in the same bank as your merchant service provider; however, having it in place is needed to accept payments from the merchant service provider. Once the business account is in place, you need to estimate your total annual receipts. Annual receipts represent the total income your business generates in a year, and having an accurate estimate plays an essential role in acquiring a credit card machine. The annual receipts estimation should encompass all business income sources including, sales, services, and other revenue streams. The total annual receipts indicate your business's financial health, and the merchant service provider relies on this information to assess if you will be a potential credible customer. While evaluating total annual receipts, consider your steady revenue sources like your monthly income. For instance, if you make 2,000 a month consistently, you can predict that your annual receipts will be around 24,000. Also, include any additional revenue streams or bonus periods where your profits might spike. It's important to remember that you don't have to give the provider an exact number; an approximation of your business's annual income is sufficient. As a side note, some businesses choose to open more than one bank account for different operational needs. By doing so, they can distribute expenses and funds appropriately, and it also helps in accounting and financial management. However, for the purpose of acquiring a credit card machine, having one business checking account is necessary. A merchant account is defined by the relationship between a business and a merchant service provider. You should be able to review your annual receipts for standard credit card expiration terms, typically four years. This thorough check gives a more comprehensive view of your business's financial standing. Before finalizing anything, always read the fine print associated with setting up a credit card machine. Consider the transaction costs, any hidden costs, the type of cards the machine can accept, and the type of connection (whether it's wired or wireless). Ensure the machine suits your business's needs effectively. In conclusion, there are multiple considerations involved in getting a credit card machine. Studying your finances beforehand and understanding the requirements is the key to smoother transactions in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning?, using the article: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust. But I can use this background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. What is an answer for this question: Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the results of Andy's science fair experiment, it can be concluded that the sheet of iron will rust faster than the cylinder, even though they both contain the same amount of iron. The primary factor influencing the rusting process is the surface area of the iron object. The increased surface area allows for more exposure of iron molecules to the environmental factors that cause rust, such as oxygen and moisture. In Andy's experiment, the sheet had a greater surface area compared to the cube and cylinder, which resulted in the sheet rusting completely in just 2 days, while the cylinder took 4 days and the cube took almost a week. As discussed in the background information, the rate of a chemical reaction involving a solid substance, such as rust forming on iron, depends on the extent to which the solid's surface is exposed to other reactants. In the case of iron rusting, the reaction involves iron combining with oxygen in the presence of moisture to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. When an iron object has a larger surface area, more of its iron molecules are exposed to oxygen and moisture, allowing the rusting reaction to proceed at a faster rate. Comparing a sheet and a cylinder with the same amount of iron, the sheet has a larger surface area than the cylinder. Therefore, the sheet will rust faster than the cylinder because more of the iron in the sheet is exposed to oxygen and moisture, allowing for a greater number of iron molecules to react and form rust. This conclusion aligns with the results of Andy's science fair experiment, which demonstrated that the iron sheet rusted significantly faster than both the cube and the cylinder due to its larger surface area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Real Madrid's 10th successive league victory ensured Manuel Pellegrini's side move above Barcelona on goal difference, just 24 hours after the defending champions had gone top with a 2-0 win over Osasuna. Four goals in the opening 37 minutes set the visitors on their way, with Ronaldo opening the scoring in the 13th minute with a superb free-kick. Higuain made it 2-0 just seven minutes later after converting Rafael van der Vaart's pass and he added a third within three minutes after being put through by fellow-Argentine Fernando Gago. That goal was Higuain's 22nd of the season, equalling his tally for the whole of last season. And Ronaldo made it 4-0 for a rampant Real side in the 37th minute -- cutting inside from the right before thundering home a superb shot into the top corner. But Getafe refused to lie down and pulled a goal back almost immediately when former Madrid player Dani Parejo dispossessed goalkeeper Iker Casillas before firing into an empty net. And the home side added a second consolation goal with 10 minutes remaining when Pedro Leon slotted home after Javi Casquero's shot had deflected off Raul Albiol. Meanwhile, Juventus continue to struggle in Italy's Serie A and they slumped to another defeat on Thursday, 3-1 at Napoli -- who moved up to sixth place in the table, one ahead of Juve. The evening started well for Alberto Zaccheroni's side and they took an early lead when defender Giorgio Chiellini nodded home from close range. The home side missed a penalty early in the second half before levelling when Fabio Quagliarella's superb cross from the left was headed home by Marek Hamsik, who had been the guilty party from the spot. Hamsik then set up Quagliarella to put Napoli ahead with 18 minutes remaining and the points were sealed with two minutes left when Ezequiel Lavezzi slotted home. Highlights:","completion":"1.

He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me. I'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back.","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as strongly negative and frustrated. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with both the service and the overall dining experience at the sushi restaurant. From the beginning, the reviewer acknowledges the good aspects of the restaurant, such as the quality of the sushi and the all-you-can-eat price. However, their experience is marred by the strict enforcement of the restaurant's policy on charging extra for uneaten food, as well as the constant reminders about the policy by the server. The reviewer's frustration is further exacerbated by the server's intrusive behavior, including staring at the reviewer, keeping a close eye on their eating habits, and repeatedly reminding them of the extra charges for leftovers. The reviewer finds this behavior unsettling and uncomfortable, making it difficult to enjoy their meal. Additionally, the reviewer's background as a server and bartender intensifies their dissatisfaction with the treatment they received, as they believe it's not the standard way to treat customers, even those who might not be following the rules perfectly. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is highly negative due to the poor customer service received, the imposing manner in which the restaurant policy was enforced, and the overall lack of consideration for the dining experience. As a result, the reviewer has no intention of returning to the restaurant and shares their worst sushi experience, leaving a lasting negative impression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

Classically trained in St. Petersburg, Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, he moved to Berlin and then New York City after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, after the stock market crash, he moved to Hollywood, where he became best known for his scores for Western films, including Duel in the Sun, Red River, High Noon, The Big Sky, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Last Train from Gun Hill. Tiomkin received twenty-two Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for High Noon, The High and the Mighty, and The Old Man and the Sea, and one for Best Original Song for \\"The Ballad of High Noon\\" from the former film. Following his work for Fred Zinnemann on The Men (1950), Tiomkin composed the score for the same director's High Noon (1952). His theme song was \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'\\" (\\"The Ballad of High Noon\\"). At its opening preview to the press, the film, which starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, did badly. Tiomkin writes that \\"film experts agreed that the picture was a flat failure... The producers hesitated to release the picture.\\" Tiomkin bought the rights to the song and released it as a single for the popular music market, with singer Frankie Laine. The record became an immediate success worldwide. Based on the song's popularity, the studio released the film four months later, with the words sung by country western star Tex Ritter. The film received seven Academy Award nominations and won four awards, including two for Tiomkin: Best Original Music and Best Song. Walt Disney presented him with both awards that evening. According to film historian Arthur R. Jarvis, Jr., the score \\"has been credited with saving the movie.\\" Another music expert, Mervyn Cooke, agrees, adding that \\"the song's spectacular success was partly responsible for changing the course of film-music history\\". Tiomkin was the second composer to receive two Oscars (score and song) for the same dramatic film. (The first was Leigh Harline, who won Best Original Score for Disney's Pinocchio and Best Song for \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". Ned Washington wrote its lyrics as he did for \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin\\".) The song's lyrics briefly tell High Noon's entire story arc, a tale of cowardice and conformity in a small Western town. Tiomkin composed his entire score around this single western-style ballad. He also eliminated violins from the ensemble. He added a subtle harmonica in the background, to give the film a \\"rustic, deglamorized sound that suits the anti-heroic sentiments\\" expressed by the story. According to Russian film historian Harlow Robinson, building the score around a single folk tune was typical of many Russian classical composers. Robinson adds that the source of Tiomkin's score, if indeed folk, has not been proven. However, the Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture, on page 124, states: \\"The fifty-year period in the USA between 1914, the start of the First World War and the year of Irving Berlin's first full score, Watch Your Step, and 1964, the premiere of Boek and Hamick's Fiddler on the Roof, is informed by a rich musical legacy from Yiddish folk tunes (for example Mark Warshavsky's \\"Di milners trem,\\" The miller's tears: and Dimitri Tiomkin's \\"Do Not Forsake Me.\\" High Noon)...\\" The composer worked again for Zinnemann on The Sundowners (1960). Tiomkin won two more Oscars in subsequent years: for The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William A. Wellman, and featuring John Wayne; and The Old Man and the Sea (1958), adapted from an Ernest Hemingway novel. During the 1955 ceremonies, Tiomkin thanked all of the earlier composers who had influenced him, including Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other names from the European classical tradition.

However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

LIEBEFELD, Switzerland -- In August 1998, as famine reached a terrible climax in North Korea, the destitute Asian nation enrolled a shy teenager in a Swiss state school. He arrived with a fake name, a collection of genuine, top-of-the-line Nike sneakers and a passion for American basketball. \\"We only dreamed about having such shoes. He was wearing them,\\" recalled Nikola Kovacevic, a former schoolmate of the curiously well-heeled North Korean. Each pair, estimates Kovacevic, cost more than 200 -- at least four times the average monthly salary in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where perhaps 1 million people died as a result of food shortages in the mid- and late 1990s. Today, the student -- who vanished from this sleepy Swiss district as mysteriously as he appeared -- is a key figure in a puzzle that U.S. and Asian intelligence services are scrambling to solve: Who will lead nuclear-armed North Korea -- and where to -- once its gravely ill leader, Kim Jong Il, passes from the scene? The answer is of vital importance to Washington, which has about 25,000 troops in South Korea, on guard against any resumption of a conflict frozen -- but never formally ended -- by a Korean War armistice accord in 1953. Who rules North Korea will decide whether Seoul, Tokyo and perhaps even Hawaii risk attack from a nation that has tested two nuclear devices, the most recent in May, and built up an arsenal of missiles and long-range artillery. The Pentagon has sent missile-defense systems to Hawaii just in case. North Korea marked July 4 this year by test-firing seven more rockets. North Korea shrouds the biographies of its rulers and their offspring in a fog of fiction and silence. \\"It is pretty amazing how very little real information we have,\\" said Victor Cha, who served as a Korea expert on the National Security Council in the Bush administration. A rare insight into this sealed world is offered by Swiss recollections of the young North Korean who, from 1998 until late 2000, lived here in Liebefeld at No. 10 Kirchstrasse, a sedate suburban street with two pizza joints, a Credit Suisse bank and a Coop supermarket. He was around 17 when he abruptly left in the middle of the school year, apparently to return to Pyongyang. There are many signs that he may now be the next leader of North Korea -- 26-year-old Kim Jong Un, the third and youngest son of Kim Jong Il. Known as \\"Pak Un\\" to his teachers at Liebefeld-Steinh√∂lzli Schule, a German-speaking state school, he was registered with Swiss authorities as the son of an employee at North Korea's embassy in the nearby city of Bern, Switzerland's capital, according to Ueli Studer, director of education in the local administration. Throughout Pak Un's time in Liebefeld, however, neither friends nor teachers ever met the parents. \\"I never saw his father or mother,\\" said the school's principal, Peter Burri, recalling how they repeatedly failed to show up for parents' night. Attending in their place, Burri said, were assorted North Koreans who apologized for the parents' absence and said this was due to their inability to speak German. A more likely reason: The boy's father didn't work in Bern at the embassy but was more than 5,000 miles away in Pyongyang. Maria Micaelo, the mother of one of Pak Un's closest school friends, said the North Korean teenager once confided to her son, Joao, that his father was the leader of North Korea. She recalled that she dismissed the claim as a fanciful teenage boast, but had second thoughts when her son saw pictures of Kim Jong Il on television and told her that he'd seen the same man in a photograph with Pak Un. Joao Micaelo, now a cook in Vienna, did not respond to repeated e-mail messages seeking comment. Kongdan Oh Hassig, an expert on North Korea at the Alexandria-based Institute for Defense Analyses, which does research for the Pentagon, says Pak Un certainly appears to be Kim Jong Il's third son, Kim Jong Un, adding that members of North Korea's elite usually use bogus names outside their homeland. Pak is a very common Korean surname akin to Smith. ||||| International Who Is Kim Jong Un? Who Really Knows? It's been two years since Kim Jong Un effectively became North Korea's \\"Great Successor\\" and heir to the seat of power in the communist nation run by a family dynasty — a dynasty that began with his grandfather, Kim Il Sung (the \\"Great Leader\\") and continued with his father, Kim Jong Il (the \\"Dear Leader\\"). i i hand-out / AFP/Getty Images hand-out / AFP/Getty Images But in that time about the only new thing we know is that he's two years older and now thought to be in his late 20s. And, that he appears about to become at least the titular head of an impoverished nation that threatens its richer neighbor to the south with nuclear weapons Other than that, you could pretty much reread this 2009 report from NPR's Anthony Kuhn, this 2010 story from NPR's Corey Flintoff and any number of other such stories from those years and be up to speed about Kim Jong Un. Still, with Saturday's death of his father, the world is watching anxiously to see what happens in North Korea and hoping to learn more about this Great Successor. So, here is some biographical material about North Korea's latest mystery man. Note: Because so much of what we've heard from North Korea about its leaders in the past has obviously been fantastical (such as Kim Jong Il's ability to control the weather), everything that's been reported about Kim Jong Un has to be viewed skeptically: — \\"Jong Un is believed to have been educated in Switzerland, where he learned to ski, and to speak English, French and German.\\" (From Anthony's 2009 report.) — \\"Analysts believe he is Kim Jong Il's son by his third wife (or consort — their marital status is unclear), a dancer named Ko Hyong Hui. ... He reportedly was disguised as the son of a North Korean embassy employee while in Berne, attending the school under a fake name. Former classmates have said he liked skiing and basketball, and idolized hoops star Michael Jordan.\\" (From Corey's 2010 report.) — He is \\"said to have a fondness for James Bond and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme. He is rumored to be married but there has never been any official word. ... [North Korean officials say] he graduated from Kim Il Sung Military University and in the fall of 2010, he was made a four-star general. ... He also received two key political posts — membership on the Central Committee of the party, and a vice chairmanship of the party's Central Military Committee, which had been overseen by his father. The anointed heir was given the titles of 'Young General' and 'Great Comrade.' \\" (Canada's CTV News.) — \\"He was always said to be his father's favorite, particularly after his older half brother, Kim Jong Nam, became something of an embarrassment by famously turning up in Japan in 2001 on a phony passport and asking to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\\" (Time magazine.) — Last year's two attacks from the North on targets in South Korea, \\"sinking a warship and shelling an island,\\" have been \\"widely regarded as linked to Kim Jong Un's rise: the 'young general' showing his mettle.\\" (BBC News) — Kim Jong Un was quickly named \\"first in the membership list of the ... 232-member funeral commission\\" that will oversee his father's burial later this month. \\"That could also be seen as a possible sign that the communist nation is under control.\\" (South Korea's Yonhap News.) We'll keep our eye out for more about him. Update at 4:11 p.m. ET. The View From A Former Intelligence Officer: NPR's Robert Siegel spoke to the author of the Inspector O detective series, a former Western intelligence officer who goes by the pen name James Church. His series of books are based in North Korea. Church told Robert that we \\"know very little about Jong Un. \\"We only began to know of his existence a few years ago,\\" after his brother was push aside 10 years ago. Church says one detail he thinks holds promise is Jong Un's studies in Switzerland. \\"I think it's a clue to something and I don't think people focused on it enough,\\" he said. But Church said it may not be what kind of impact the studies had Jong Un's worldview that interest him, but why his father wanted to send him to a Western school. It might imply something about where Kim Jong Il saw the country going in his absence, said Church. Much more of Robert's talk with Church is on tonight's All Things Considered.

Kim Jong-il, North Korea's \\"Dear Leader\\", was in the process of grooming him as his successor when he died in December 2011. Immediately after his father's death, the younger Kim was hailed as \\"the great successor\\". He was named head of the party, state and army within a fortnight of his father's death. Since then, he has shown he is committed to the advancement of North Korea's weapons programme, ordering four nuclear tests and several missile tests. He has also shown himself to be ruthless with the purge of his powerful uncle and the murder, widely attributed to an order from him, of his half-brother. 'Morning Star King' Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his third wife Ko Yong-hui, was born in 1983 or 1984. Image copyright AFP Image caption The undated image shows Kim Jong-un as a student in Switzerland He was initially not thought to be in the frame to take up his father's mantle. Analysts focused instead on his older half-brother Kim Jong-nam and older full brother Kim Jong-chol. However Kim Jong-nam's deportation from Japan in May 2001 and middle brother Kim Jong-chol's reported \\"unmanliness\\" improved his chances. Analysts saw him as the coming man after he was awarded a series of high-profile political posts. Swiss-educated like his brothers, Kim Jong-un avoided Western influences, returning home when not in school and dining out with the North Korean ambassador. After his return to Pyongyang, he is known to have attended the Kim Il-sung Military University. His mother was thought to be Kim Jong-il's favourite wife, and she clearly doted on her son, reportedly calling him the \\"Morning Star King\\". In August 2010, when Kim Jong-il visited China, one report said Kim Jong-un had accompanied his father on the trip. By then he was widely seen as the heir-apparent and when Kim Jong-il died, this was quickly confirmed. Military-first Mr Kim made his first public speech as North Korea marked the 100th anniversary of the birthday of founder Kim Il-sung on 15 April 2012, praising the \\"military first\\" doctrine and vowing the time his nation could be threatened was \\"forever over\\".

Four more nuclear tests have taken place, bringing the regime's total to six. Pyongyang claims it has successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile, but experts remain divided on how advanced its programme is. The reach of North Korea's missiles also appears to have increased. In 2017 the regime test-fired several missiles, and claimed it had tested intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the US - leading to a surge in tensions with the Donald Trump-led administration and an intensified UN sanctions regime. As the animosity between the two sides rose, Mr Trump and Mr Kim engaged in an increasingly fiery war of words.

Mr Trump called the North Korean leader a \\"rocket man on a suicide mission\\" while Mr Kim called the US leader a \\"mentally deranged US dotard\\". Yet, unexpectedly, Mr Kim offered an olive branch to South Korea in his new year's address, saying he was \\"open to dialogue\\" and might send a team to the February 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. A flurry of diplomatic activity followed, with the two Koreas marching under one flag in the Olympic opening ceremony, and high-level meetings taking place between the two sides. Two milestone meetings have now been planned: a summit between Mr Kim and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in in late April, and a face to face meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in May - the first of its kind between sitting US and North Korean leaders. Ahead of the two summits, Mr Kim made his first known foreign trip as leader. He took a train to Beijing - North Korea's main ally and trading partner. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chinese TV showed footage of the two leaders with their wives In April, Kim Jong-un said he had suspended all missile tests and would shut down a nuclear test site, because his country had achieved \\"nuclear weaponisation\\". Although the halt was welcomed internationally, observers pointed out that Pyongyang had not pledged to get rid of its existing weapons, and has previously broken promises to halt nuclear development. Meet the Kims Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Kim and Ms Ri are thought to have three children Domestically, Mr Kim's repeated replacement of defence ministers - there have been at least six men in the post since 2011 - has been seen by some analysts as an indication of his lack of confidence in the loyalty of the armed forces. And the most high-profile indication of a possible power struggle within the North Korean elite came in December 2013, when Kim Jong-un ordered the execution of his uncle Chang Song-thaek. State media said he had been plotting a coup. Mr Kim is also widely believed to have ordered the murder of his exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in February 2017 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Not much was known of Mr Kim's personal life until television footage of an unidentified woman attending events with him surfaced. In July 2012, state media announced that Mr Kim was married to \\"Comrade Ri Sol-ju\\". Image copyright AFP Image caption Kim Yo-jong, Mr Kim's sister, holds a senior post in the Workers' Party of Korea Little is known of Ms Ri, but her stylish appearance led some analysts to suggest that she was from an upper-class family.

Mr Kim's sister, Kim Yo-jong, holds a senior post in the Workers' Party of Korea - and stole the limelight when she represented her brother at the Winter Olympics in the South. It is not known whether his elder brother, Kim Jong-chol, holds an official role. ||||| CTVNews.ca Staff Like so much about North Korea, the man expected to lead the country next, Kim Jong Un, is a mystery. So little is known about the younger Kim, both within his home country and by the outside world, even his age appears to be a state-guarded secret. Since his father's death was announced Monday, North Korean state media has fallen short of calling Kim Jong Un the country's next leader. But they are making it clear that Kim Jong Il's son will succeed his father, lauding him as the \\"Great Successor,\\" and \\"the outstanding leader of our party, army and people.\\" North Korea's official KCNA news agency said that while North Koreans from all walks of life were in utter despair over the death of their leader, they were finding comfort in the \\"absolute surety that the leadership of Comrade Kim Jong Un will lead and succeed the great task of revolutionary enterprise.\\" Much of what is known about the younger Kim has been gleaned in only the last three years, because before Kim Jong Il suffered what is believed to be a stroke in August 2008, he had never been seen in public before. It's believed the new, chubby-faced leader is in his late 20s and was educated at an English-language school in Switzerland. He speaks some English, as well as some German and French, and is said to have a fondness for James Bond and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme. He is rumoured to be married but there has never been any official word. But what role Kim Jong Un has played in preparing to take over his country's leadership is unknown; there isn't even a record that he has served in his country's military. Nevertheless, the country insists he graduated from Kim Il Sung Military University and in the fall of 2010, he was made a four-star general. That occurred during a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party -- the first time Jong Un had ever appeared publicly. At that same meeting, he also received two key political posts — membership on the Central Committee of the party, and a vice chairmanship of the party's Central Military Committee, which had been overseen by his father. The anointed heir was given the titles of \\"Young General\\" and \\"Great Comrade,\\" and began appearing in public alongside his father as they toured North Korea's factories and military facilities and voted in elections. Since then, the country has pushed forward an image of Jong Un as destined to follow in both his father's footsteps, and the footsteps of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who founded North Korea in 1948. But Jong Un has not had the years of grooming for leadership that his own father enjoyed before he took over the impoverished country in 1994. By then, Jong Il had a full two decades to prepare for leadership. He had even taken part in a number of military moves against the North's hated neighbour to the South, including masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South Korean officials visiting Burma, and the 1987 bombing of a Korean Air Flight that killed all 115 on board. By contrast, Kim Jong Un has had but a handful of years to adjust. Nevertheless, state-run media have worked to build a cult of personality around Kim Jong Un, just as they did for his father. Shortly after he was given the titles of \\"Young General\\" and \\"Great Comrade,\\" Jong Un was credited with directing the surprise shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island last December. It's not clear why Kim Jong Il chose his youngest son to succeed him, since he has two other sons. It's said that his eldest, Kim Jong-nam, lost any hope for power in 2001, when he embarrassed his father by trying to enter Japan with his family on fake passports for a trip to Japan's Disneyland. His middle son, Kim Jong-chol, also attended school in Switzerland and was said to be a fan of Michael Jordan, Eric Clapton and Keanu Reeves. But his father reportedly dismissed his chances for leadership because he thought him too \\"girlish.\\" As Jong Un moves into his new role, he is expected to have the guardianship of his aunt, his father's only sister, Kim Kyong hui, 64. She was promoted to general in 2010, while her husband, Jang Song thaek, is seen as the country's unofficial No. 2 leader. Jang was a rising star among the country's leadership until he was demoted by Jong Il as a strike against his perceived grasp at power. But Jong Il turned to him again after he became ill in 2008 and it is thought that Jang still wields plenty of power in Pyongyang. It's possible that over the next few months or years, Jong Un might act as a figurehead for a government led by his older relatives, some analysts believe. How he will eventually transition out of that remains to be seen. ||||| By Andreas Lorenz North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has died of a heart attack and his son Kim Jong Un is set to take the helm, according to state media. But who is the young man dubbed the \\"Great Successor\\" and how will he lead the reclusive nation? The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on Saturday has propelled the region into deep uncertainty. The \\"Dear Leader\\" died of a heart attack during a train ride, state television reported early on Monday morning. The big question now is: Who will succeed the late ruler? The official news agency KCNA sent a clear signal on Monday, naming the North Korean ruler's son Kim Jong Un as \\"the Great Successor.\\" It wrote that \\"Kim Jong Un is now at the head of the Korean revolution.\\" Kim Jong Un topped the list of officials who will lead the funeral, seen as a big hint as to who will take the reins of the state. KCNA said the funeral will take place in Pyongyang on Dec. 28, with the mourning period lasting until Dec. 29. \\"We will prevail in our revolution today and tomorrow, because we have comrade Kim Jong Un,\\" KCNA quoted a resident of Pyongyang as saying. Little is known about the leader's youngest son. His mother, Kim Jong Il's third wife, was a dancer who was born in Japan. She died of cancer in 2004. Jong Un is probably 29 years old and studied in Bern, Switzerland under a false name from 1998 to 2000. After class, he was reportedly always whisked away into the custody of the North Korean embassy. Back in North Korea, his father sent him to a military academy between 2002 and 2007, where he was allegedly trained as an artilleryman. He is later said to have worked in the \\"Leadership Section\\" of the party which manages all senior members' files. Some North Korean experts suspect he spent a brief stint working for the intelligence service. He has been general of the North Korean army for a year and is a member of the powerful National Defense Commission. A Fearless Personality Now he will continue the family dynasty, but no one knows what he and his entourage stand for or what his leadership will mean for the hermit state. Jong Un has no foreign policy experience, but may have spent some time in China. His father reportedly introduced him to the Beijing leadership. Will Kim the third seek reconciliation with South Korea or blackmail the world with nuclear bombs? Will he start opening his closed country, à la Gorbachev, or continue to run the planned economy with a grotesque personality cult, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather Kim Il Sung? Kim Jong Il's former Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto wrote in his memoir that the leader-to-be is both ambitious and tough. He also resembles his father in appearance, shape and personality, he wrote. A year before his death, the elder Kim tried to get his house in order by placing relatives and confidantes in key positions in the party and the army. Kim wanted to ensure that the powerful army rallies behind his son, thus safeguarding his family's grip on power, at least for now. Kim's sister Kim Kyong Hui, 65, formerly responsible for light industry, became the first woman to rise to the rank of four-star general and join the Politburo. The Purity of Korean People Other relatives and comrades will also act as mentors for the young man: Kyong Hui's husband Chang Sung Taek is expected to advise the new leader. Korean refugees have described Chang, a senior member of the National Defense Commission, as \\"number two\\" in the party. Family members will also pull strings behind the scenes. The deceased leader's fourth wife and a daughter from his first marriage will both likely exert influence. Meanwhile, one of his confidants has been recently appointed Vice-Marshal. Kim's clan has operated a strict planned economy and forged a unique ideology, which hinges on quasi-religious notions of the purity of the Korean people rather than Marxism. In North Korea, a holy family prevails over a childlike people, protecting it from dangerous outside influences. They derive their legitimacy from Kim's family history. The ascendant leader's grandfather Kim Il Sung founded the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\" with Stalin's help in 1948. Since then the family has adorned their dictatorship with legends and mysteries: the country's fate is closely linked to the holy mountain of Mount Baekdu, seen as the crib of their ancestry. Koreans' survival allegedly hinges on the continuation of the revolutionary family's bloodline, a belief which is taught to North Korean children in kindergarten. During a battle against the Japanese in 1942, Kim Jong Il reportedly saw the light of the world in a guerrilla camp on Mount Baekdu. The legend goes that he saw a double rainbow in the sky. Kim Jong Il, who began his rule in 1994, is still seen as the \\"Eternal President,\\" ruling his subjects from beyond the grave. It remains to be seen how his legacy will be steered into the future. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his third wife Ko Yong-hui, was born in the early 1980s and was initially not considered as a contender for taking up his father's position.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rio Olympics 2016: Simone Biles dominates to win all-around gold American gymnast Simone Biles produced a stunning performance to win the women's all-around Olympic gold medal. Biles, 19, who has won 10 World Championship medals since 2013, scored 62.198 to win her second Olympic medal by a margin of more than two points. Compatriot Alexandra Raisman got silver with Russia's Aliya Mustafina third. Great Britain's Ellie Downie came 13th, narrowly missing out on becoming the best performing female British gymnast in an Olympic all-around final. Biles, described by many as the greatest ever gymnast, had arrived in Rio as the overwhelming favourite for gold and the 4ft 8in athlete delivered in a big way. Having already led the United States to victory in the team event, she turned the spotlight on her individual brilliance with a dazzling display of power, agility and gravity-defying moves. She went ahead after the first of four disciplines with a score of 15.866 on vault, although she dropped back to second with 14.966 on the uneven bars, with Mustafina taking the lead at the halfway point. Biles then turned on the style with an acrobatic beam routine that included a stunning spin to score 15.433 before a floor routine to samba music packed with energetic tumbles, including the move that bears her name. She scored 15.933 for that final routine and burst into tears when the victory was confirmed. The United States have now won this event four times in a row, following victories by Carly Patterson in 2004, Nastia Liukin in 2008 and Gabrielle Douglas in 2012. Biles has more chances for success in Rio as she is also in the vault final on Sunday, the beam final on Monday and the floor final on Tuesday. Britain's Max Whitlock had won a bronze medal in the men's event on Wednesday, but Downie's medal hopes ended with a poor score on her third apparatus, the uneven bars, before she made another error on beam. Find out how to get into gymnastics with our special guide. Those mistakes saw her drop down from seventh to 13th, to miss out on emulating her sister Becky Downie, who came 12th in the all-around final at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Seventeen-year-old Ellie Downie, the winner of the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award in 2015, gained a total of 56.883 after scores of 14.300 on floor, 15.100 on vault, 13.783 on uneven bars and 13.700 on beam. Gold medallist Simone Biles said: \\"I'm very excited and relieved, I've finally done it. You never know the feeling until it hits you. \\"I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps, I'm the first Simone Biles. To me I'm just the same Simone.\\" Silver-medallist Alexandra Raisman added: \\"No-one goes into this thinking they can beat Simone. \\"I'm sure most people don't go into it thinking they can beat Usain Bolt, so it's kind of the same thing. \\"We are like sisters. I told her before today, I want you to win and I want second.\\" Great Britain's Ellie Downie said: \\"I was really happy with how floor and vault went. On bars I lost a bit of concentration, which is something I'll learn from. \\"On beam I didn't feel nervous and the actual routine was really good but the landing I needed to focus more. \\"It's mixed emotions knowing if I had gone clean I had a chance of a medal, which shows I'm right up there. That's a big positive to take out of these Games. \\"It's been a bit of a rollercoaster experience but I'm very proud of what I've achieved.\\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.","completion":"American gymnast Simone Biles secured the women's all-around Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics after an impressive performance that pushed her more than two points ahead of her competitors.
