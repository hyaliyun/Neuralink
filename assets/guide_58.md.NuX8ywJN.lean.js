You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.npr.android.news.","completion":"Title: Lacking Smooth Functionality - Needs Improvement (2/5) I recently downloaded the app \\"org.npr.android.news\\" to stay updated with the latest news and enjoy the engaging storytelling NPR is known for. Although it contains a wealth of information, I must admit I am quite disappointed with the overall experience of using this app, warranting a 2-star rating. Firstly, the user interface is far from intuitive. As a first time user, I expected the app to offer a walkthrough or at least a brief explanation of how to navigate around the different features and sections. However, I found myself feeling lost and confused in the maze of menus, resulting in a frustrating experience. Additionally, the app is cluttered with unnecessary elements, making it difficult to focus on the content. Another major issue with the \\"org.npr.android.news\\" app is its frequent crashes and stability issues. Numerous times, while browsing through the app or listening to a news story, the application would suddenly close without any warning. Restarting the app didn't always fix the issue, which led to a lot of wasted time and growing frustration. An app serving such time-sensitive content like the news should prioritize stability and performance. The search feature on this app leaves much to be desired. On multiple occasions, the search function would return completely irrelevant results, taking longer than necessary to find relevant content. A search bar should ideally be more efficient and point users in the right direction, but unfortunately, that is not the case with org.npr.android.news. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that the app drains my smartphone battery at an alarming rate. This significantly limits the duration of usage, and makes it hard to rely on the app as a primary news source while on-the-go. On a positive note, I would like to mention that once the desired content is finally found, the quality of the news articles and audio reports is high, reflecting NPR's reputation for reliable journalism. However, with the current state of the app, those moments of relief are sadly overshadowed by the constant hurdles encountered along the way. In conclusion, while the \\"org.npr.android.news\\" app has potential, it is severely hindered by its poor user interface, stability issues, inefficient search function, and battery consumption. I genuinely hope that these concerns will be addressed in future updates, allowing NPR's journalism to shine through a well-designed and functional app. Until then, I am unfortunately unable to rate it higher than two stars."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim (I. S. Johar) succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man. Sherif Ali, won over, burns Lawrence's British uniform and gives him Arab robes to wear.Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks.

Given the question: Seven tips to good table manners Whether it's a dinner at a friend's house or a business meeting over lunch, we judge people based on their table manners. But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip. Which of the following should parents do to help their kids learn good table manners? A) Try dining out in fast food restaurants once in a while. B) Point out what's wrong with the kids' behavior at dinner. C) Keep telling the kids how to behave themselves at dinner. D) Improve kids' sense of manners by having a formal dinner at times.

Movie title: Ballot Box Bunny Context: Yosemite Sam is running for mayor of a small town, declaring such empty promises as: \\"There's enough fresh air and sunshine in this great country of ours for everybody â and I'll see to it, that you'll get your share!\\". Bugs Bunny is underneath the podium drinking carrot juice when Sam makes a pledge to make good on his previous promise \\"to rid this country of every last rabbit\\" if elected. Bugs then decides he needs to fight against Sam by running against him for mayor. Bugs proceeds to quickly try and win the townspeople over with Theodore Roosevelt's famous \\"I speak softly, but I carry a BIG stick!\\" quote, even dressing up like Roosevelt. However, Sam declares \\"I speak LOUD and I carry a BIGGER stick, and I use it too!\\" (When watching this on The Bugs Bunny Show, Daffy Duck says \\"I speak medium, and I carry the BIGGEST stick.) Sam has more than a few tricks up his sleeve. He steals Bugs' cigar stand, to which Bugs switches his \\"SMELLO\\" cigars with five-cent ATOM Explosive Cigars (\\"You Will Get A BANG Out of This\\"). He sends a boxful of \\"assorted\\" picnic ants to steal all of the food at Bugs' picnic, to which Bugs hides a dynamite stick in a watermelon for him. Then he rigs a cannon at the front door of Bugs' headquarters and greets Bugs with friendship at the back door, but the plan backfires on him when Bugs pretends that a pretty girl named Emma who loves Sam is at the front door. Then he challenges Bugs, asking him if he can \\"play the pi-anna\\", and Bugs takes the challenge, so he rigs explosives in the piano at a certain key and presents the piano to Bugs to play \\"Those Endearing Young Charms\\" (a gag recycled from a Private Snafu short), but Bugs misplays the tune on purpose to infuriate Sam, who plays it correctly and falls for his own trap. A quick chase through the streets leads the pair to the parade for the newly elected mayor.

Step 1: Understand the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Don't know\\" – It implies a lack of knowledge or uncertainty about a subject or matter. Hypothesis: \\"I do know\\" – It implies having knowledge or certainty about a subject or matter. Step 2: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis are opposite statements. If one is true, the other must be false. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. For the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, the truth of the premise must necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise \\"Don't know\\" does not lead to the truth of the hypothesis \\"I do know\\" since they contradict each other.

Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What is Roger Dorn's nature described as that could be termed a struggle? Movie plot title: Major League Movie plot: Former Las Vegas showgirl Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) has inherited the Cleveland Indians baseball team from her deceased husband. Phelps has received a lucrative deal to move the team to Miami, and she aims to trigger the escape clause in the team's contract with Cleveland if season attendance falls below minimum levels. To do this, she replaces their existing players with aging veterans and inexperienced rookies, hoping a bad team will cause attendance to decline. Phelps hires Lou Brown, a former coach from the Toledo Mud Hens to manage the team. During spring training in Tucson, Brown and veteran catcher Jake Taylor discover the new team has a number of interpersonal issues as well as their own struggles with the game, such as the prima donna nature of Roger Dorn, the only player on a long-term contract with the Indians, and the weak arm of veteran pitcher Eddie Harris who is forced to doctor his pitches to stay competitive. The team starts the season on a losing streak. Their rookie pitcher, Ricky Vaughn, has an incredible fastball but with little control, leading him to be called \\"Wild Thing\\"; however, by chance, Brown discovers Vaughn has eyesight problems, and when they fit him with glasses, his pitching drastically improves, helping the Indians to a series of wins. The team rallies, bringing the Indians higher in the division standings. Phelps tries to demoralize the team by taking away their luxuries such as a private jet, but the team still holds strong, and appears to have a shot at winning the division. Meanwhile, Taylor finds that his ex-girlfriend Lynn is living in Cleveland, and tries to get her to come back to him even after learning she has become engaged to a new beau. When Phelps' original plan falls through, she decides that she will purposely void the contract, despite the financial penalty, and will move the team to Miami regardless. Donovan relays this to Brown, who informs the team that no matter how well they do, they will be fired after the season. The team succeeds in tying the...

We want to find out what number \\"y\\" is. The equation is: -5*y = 32*y - 259 First, we're going to move the \\"-5*y\\" from the left side to the right side of the equation. To do that we need to add \\"5*y\\" to both sides. This will help us have all the \\"y\\" parts on one side. So it looks like this: -5*y + 5*y = 32*y - 259 + 5*y Now, the left side will be just \\"0\\" because -5*y and +5*y cancel each other out: 0 = 37*y - 259 Now, we want to get rid of the \\"-259\\" on the right side. We do this by adding \\"259\\" to both sides. It looks like this: 0 + 259 = 37*y - 259 + 259 So now, we have: 259 = 37*y We're almost there! To find out the value of \\"y,\\" we just need to divide both sides by \\"37\\": 259 / 37 = 37*y / 37 This simplifies to: 7 = y So, y equals 7. There you have it!

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Ivan III considered himself an heir to the fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Rus' and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'. Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The Mongol Yoke ended in 1480 with the defeat of Akhmat Khan of the Golden Horde in the Great stand on the Ugra river. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests. Around 1486-87, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian-Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Muscovy, allied with Meñli I Giray, khan of the Crimean Khanate. Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk; raided Mosalsk; and attacked territory of the Dukes of Vyazma. Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians. Ivan III officially declared war in 1493, but the conflict soon ended. Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate a peace treaty. An \\"eternal\\" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494. The agreement marked the first Lithuanian territorial losses to Moscow: the Principality of Vyazma and a sizable region in the upper reaches of the Oka River.

What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea? from the following article ? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

Question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was not formally trained but gifted? is inside the article: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in..., can you guess it ?

By sharing these experiences, Casey and Ash are able to strengthen their bond and reaffirm the importance of their shared history. When someone shows interest in our past experiences, it communicates that they value the time spent together and genuinely care about our well-being.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who's father is a lawyer? ? After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it. However, Dortmunder cannot access the box because of bank vault security, and the gang leaves Abe in Dr. Amusa's office while they come up with a plan.

Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir ( or ; French pronunciation: [simon d@ bovwaR] ( listen); 9 January 1908 - 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory. De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels, including She Came to Stay and The Mandarins. De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, \\"Simone thinks like a man!\\" Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself. After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the Institut Sainte-Marie. She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her diplome d'etudes superieures (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Leibniz for Leon Brunschvicg (the topic was \\"Le concept chez Leibniz\\" [\\"The Concept in Leibniz\\"]). De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education. De Beauvoir first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Levi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the Ecole Normale Superieure in preparation for the agregation in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the agregation that she met Ecole Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and Rene Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname \\"Castor\\", or beaver). The jury for the agregation narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam. Writing of her youth in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter she said: \\"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did she ever regret what she chose to study?","completion":"Simone de Beauvoir did not express any regret in what she chose to study.

This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules.

News article: California weighs college aid for illegal immigrants Nearly 20 years ago, California became the first state to crack down on immigration when voters approved a measure that cut off education, health and other benefits to illegal immigrants and their children. Now, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown is considering signing a bill that would grant financial aid to some illegal immigrants attending state colleges and universities. That would be in addition to laws that allow some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition and let them accept privately funded college grants. As states such as Arizona, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina push hard stances against illegal immigrants, the turnaround in the Golden State is viewed as either a Democratic-controlled Legislature ignoring the will of Californians, or a path that other states will soon be following. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Republican, is convinced that people in his state are opposed to the state's move toward acceptance of illegal immigrants. When Californians approved Proposition 187 — the voter referendum that cut benefits to illegal immigrants — in 1994, it passed with 59% of the vote. He's confident that voters still feel that way, so he's prepared to push for another voter referendum to overturn the college financial aid bill if Brown signs it into law. \\"Why is an illegal's dream more important than an American's dream?\\" asked Donnelly, who founded a Minuteman group to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border before being elected to office. \\"There's a tsunami of discontent with this bill. Outrage isn't even a strong enough word.\\" The bill, passed Sept. 2 by the Legislature, would give illegal immigrant students about 40million in financial aid and fee waivers. Anti-immigration groups says it makes even less sense when considering California's financial plight. \\"With a state that's billions of dollars in the red — our own version of Greece in the United States — the idea of giving additional taxpayer money to illegal immigrants is surreal,\\" said Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates lower levels of immigration. \\"It's hard to believe.\\" Some say the state's growing acceptance of illegal immigrants is a preview of what will happen as Hispanics — the fastest-growing demographic in the country — spread out to new states and establish families. \\"It appears that you get the most anti-immigration sentiment where immigrant populations are newer and where they are growing and when there's a climate where political leaders are drawing attention to this,\\" said John Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California-San Diego. A poll last year found that, for the first time, more Californians opposed a new version of Prop 187, according to a University of Southern California Dornsife College/Los Angeles Times poll. Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, said that's partly a result of more Hispanics entering the state and non-Hispanics leaving in recent decades. But he said the poll found that young, white voters were far more likely to oppose laws that bar illegal immigrants from receiving benefits because so many had grown up surrounded by Hispanics. \\"Because younger Californians are growing up in a multiethnic, multicultural society, they're much less likely to draw these types of distinctions than older voters,\\" Schnur said. That helps explain why states farther north and east are just recently starting their anti-immigration battles, Skrentny said. Georgia, which passed an anti-immigration law this year that was blocked by a federal judge, saw its Hispanic population nearly double from 2000 to 2010. South Carolina passed another anti-immigration law, which is being challenged in federal court, after its Hispanic population rose by 148% over the same time . And Indiana, which passed an anti-immigration law that has been halted by a federal judge, saw an additional 170,000 Hispanics pour into the state in the past decade. \\"These are folks that are not used to this kind of ethnic diversity,\\" Skrentny said. \\"That suggests that places like Alabama and Georgia are closer to where California was in the 1990s, and it suggests that California has moved on.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about California possibly giving college financial aid to illegal immigrants.

Imagine the shock of theater-goers when, during the opening number, a seemingly peaceful performance almost went off-track as a service dog suddenly broke free from its owner and dashed towards the stage. The pup's target? Actress Mackenzie Warren, who was skillfully portraying the character, Bombalurina. Witnesses who reported to the New York Post stated that the service dog, seemingly spooked or enticed by the lavish production, slipped its owner's grasp and bounded on stage. It appeared to have only one goal in mind—to go after the feline character on display. Amidst the commotion that quickly followed, an usher from the theater bravely stepped in to quell the potentially chaotic situation. Demonstrating remarkable swiftness and composure, the usher managed to round up the courageous canine that had gone rogue in the name of audience safety. Once the dog had been secured, the usher returned it to a mortified owner who was, at that point, apologetic for the disruption caused by their four-legged friend. It is noteworthy that the Neil Simon Theatre generally operates under a \\"no animals\\" policy. However, specific exceptions are made for guide dogs and service animals that are called upon to provide assistance to patrons in need. As a representative for the musical relayed to the Post, in the long and storied history of Cats, this is the very first incident in which one of the \\"actual cats\\" was involved in an altercation with a dog. Assuaging any concerns that may have arisen, the representative confirmed that there were no injuries sustained by either the cast or the furry diva. Fortunately, it was not long until composure and calm were restored within the theater. The show, which typically maintains its reputation for delightful theatrical artistry, was able to continue shortly after the order was reestablished. Regardless of this extraordinary incident, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats undeniably remains an iconic production—cherished and enjoyed by both audiences and performers alike. While situations such as these are unlikely to recur often, the incident that unfolded in the Neil Simon Theatre serves to remind us all that, within the captivating sphere of live theater, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. In our increasingly fast-paced and digital-oriented world, this close encounter between Cats and a lone service dog on stage provides a timely reminder of the enduring appeal of live theater.

Analysts at the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence arm found insufficient evidence... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Analysts at the Homeland Security Department's intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Donald Trump's travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States. A draft document obtained by The Associated Press concludes that citizenship is an \\"unlikely indicator\\" of terrorism threats to the United States and that few people from the countries Trump listed in his travel ban have carried out attacks or been involved in terrorism-related activities in the U.S. since Syria's civil war started in 2011. Trump cited terrorism concerns as the primary reason he signed the sweeping temporary travel ban in late January, which also halted the U.S. refugee program. A federal judge in Washington state blocked the government from carrying out the order earlier this month. Trump said Friday a new edict would be announced soon. The administration has been working on a new version that could withstand legal challenges. Homeland Security spokeswoman Gillian Christensen on Friday did not dispute the report's authenticity, but said it was not a final comprehensive review of the government's intelligence. \\"While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue, the document you're referencing was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing,\\" Christensen said. \\"The ... report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is incomplete.\\" The Homeland Security report is based on unclassified information from Justice Department press releases on terrorism-related convictions and attackers killed in the act, State Department visa statistics, the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment from the U.S. intelligence community and the State Department Country Reports on Terrorism 2015. The three-page report challenges Trump's core claims. It said that of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U.S. citizens born in the United States. The others were from 26 countries, led by Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq and Uzbekistan. Of these, only Somalia and Iraq were among the seven nations included in the ban. Of the other five nations, one person each from Iran, Sudan and Yemen was also involved in those terrorism cases, but none from Syria. It did not say if any were Libyan. The report also found that terrorist organizations in Iran, Libya, Somalia and Sudan are regionally focused, while groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen do pose a threat to the U.S. The seven countries were included in a law President Barack Obama signed in 2015 that updated visa requirements for foreigners who had traveled to those countries. Christensen said the countries were also selected in part because they lacked the ability to properly vet their citizens and don't cooperate with U.S. efforts to screen people hoping to come to the U.S. The report was prepared as part of an internal review Trump requested after his executive order was blocked by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It was drafted by staff of the Homeland Security Department's Intelligence and Analysis branch at the direction of its acting leader, David Glawe. White House spokesman Michael Short said this was not the full report that Trump had requested. He said he believes \\"the intel community is combining resources to put together a comprehensive report using all available sources, not just open sources, and which is driven by data, not politics.\\" The intelligence document was circulated beyond Homeland Security. The draft document reflects the tensions between the president's political appointees and the civil servants tasked with carrying out Trump's ambitious and aggressive agenda. Trump has repeatedly complained about leaks meant to undercut his policies and suggested he does not trust holdovers from the Obama administration. Trump originally said the ban was necessary to overhaul the vetting system for both refugees and would-be foreign visitors, saying that terrorists may try to exploit weaknesses to gain access to the United States. The order sparked chaos, outrage and widespread protests, with travelers detained at airports and panicked families searching for relatives. But several courts quickly intervened and the 9th Circuit ultimately upheld a ruling blocking the ban and challenged the administration's claim that it was motivated by terrorism fears. Trump's ban temporarily barred citizens from the seven countries from coming to the United States for three months. The order also temporarily shut down the U.S. refugee program for four months and indefinitely banned anyone from Syria. A senior administration official told the AP on Sunday that a draft of the revised order will target those same seven countries. The official would not be named discussing the document before it is made public. In a speech Friday to the Conservative Political Action Committee, Trump reiterated his claims on terrorism. \\"We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\\" Trump said.

Some officials have critiqued administration policies, while the president and senior members of his staff have accused officials of leaking... ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has assigned the Department of Homeland Security, working with the Justice Department, to help build the legal case for its temporary travel ban on individuals from seven countries, a senior White House official tells CNN. Other Trump administration sources tell CNN that this is an assignment that has caused concern among some administration intelligence officials, who see the White House charge as the politicization of intelligence -- the notion of a conclusion in search of evidence to support it after being blocked by the courts. Still others in the intelligence community disagree with the conclusion and are finding their work disparaged by their own department. \\"DHS and DOJ are working on an intelligence report that will demonstrate that the security threat for these seven countries is substantial and that these seven countries have all been exporters of terrorism into the United States,\\" the senior White House official told CNN. \\"The situation has gotten more dangerous in recent years, and more broadly, the refugee program has been a major incubator for terrorism.\\" The report was requested in light of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Trump administration \\"has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\\" The seven counties are Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The senior White House official said the desire to bolster the legal and public case that these seven countries pose a threat is a work in progress and as of now, it's not clear if DHS and DOJ will offer separate reports or a joint report. One of the ways the White House hopes to make its case is by using a more expansive definition of terrorist activity than has been used by other government agencies in the past. The senior White House official said he expects the report about the threat from individuals the seven countries to include not just those terrorist attacks that have been carried out causing loss of innocent American life, but also those that have resulted in injuries, as well as investigations into and convictions for the crimes of a host of terrorism-related actions, including attempting to join or provide support for a terrorist organization. The White House did not offer an on-the-record comment for this story despite numerous requests. The Department of Homeland Security, however, issued a statement Friday afternoon saying the seven countries were identified by the Obama administration as being of \\"great concern for terrorism.\\" Dissension and concern The White House expectation of what the report will show has some intelligence officials within the administration taking issue with this intelligence review, sources told CNN. First, some intelligence officials disagree with the conclusion that immigration from these countries should be temporarily banned in the name of making the US safer. CNN has learned that the Department of Homeland Security's in-house intelligence agency, the I&A offered a report that is at odds with the Trump administration's view that blocking immigration from these seven countries strategically makes sense. It's not clear if this was the conclusion of the I&A report but many DHS officials have said they do not think nationality is the best indicator of potential terrorist inclinations. A Department of Homeland Security source who asked for anonymity since he was not authorized to speak on the record said the report from the I&A officials did not meet the standards of the agency since it relied upon open source material and did not utilize necessary data from the intelligence community, specifically the FBI. Others in DHS disagree with that assessment of the I&A report and a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security told CNN that some DHS officials are concerned that the new I&A director -- Acting Undersecretary for Intelligence David Glawe -- may be politicizing intelligence. One source familiar with the department told CNN that Glawe came into I&A \\"like a bull in a china shop.\\" A DHS official says the intention was to put together a comprehensive report with multiple sources and other agencies but the individuals in I&A did not do that to the standard that was required by their leadership, so Glawe said the report wasn't sufficient to go forward.\\" DHS spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen said the report was \\"commentary from open source reporting versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing. The (Office of Intelligence and Analysis) report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is clear on its face that it is an incomplete product that fails to find evidence of terrorism by simply refusing to look at all the available evidence.\\" \\"Any suggestion by opponents of the President's policies that senior DHS intelligence officials would politicize this process or a report's final conclusions is absurd and not factually accurate. The dispute with this product was over sources and quality, not politics,\\" Christensen added. The seven countries were originally designated by DHS in the Obama administration for tighter immigration scrutiny -- removing them from the visa waiver program -- but not for a temporary suspension of immigration, as the Trump administration has attempted. A second issue for many in the intelligence community is the notion of the Trump White House seeking an intelligence report to fit the policy instead of the other way around, sources tell CNN. A senior government official told CNN that the normal procedure would be for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to be tasked with creating such an intelligence report, working with all relevant agencies and providing dissenting views. Theoretically, this would be done before the policy was formulated. The senior White House official told CNN that it's possible that the National Counterterrorism Center, via the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and perhaps the National Security Council might also provide reports on the same subject. A senior government official told CNN that the National Counterterrorism Center, via the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, has already been tasked with such a report, separately from DHS and DOJ. This has prompted some in government to wonder whether the White House is shopping around among agencies for the report that best bolsters their policy and legal support for it. Other intelligence officials told CNN that such discussions among agencies about differing interpretations of the existing intelligence are not unusual and do not necessarily reflect an effort to \\"shop around\\" for intelligence to support a particular policy. White House to make its case The White House is determined to prove that the Ninth Circuit argument is wrong, as are Democrats and those in the media, that terror attacks do not predominantly originate from the seven countries targeted by Trump's order. Rep. Jerrold Nadler said on CNN late last month that \\"the various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the President's executive order.\\" The senior White House official told CNN that the Ninth Circuit's language that no one from those seven countries has \\"perpetrated a terrorist attack\\" or Nadler's comment that none had \\"committed terrorist acts\\" is false. \\"It's using the most narrow definition of the term you can use,\\" the official said -- referring only to those who had successful killed an innocent civilian. That definition does not include those who wounded Americans, or those who plotted but failed in their attacks, or those who tried to join or provide material support to a terrorist group. Information will soon be presented to the public that makes this stronger case using the broader definition. A case in point: Somali-born Abdul Razak Ali Artan attempted to run over and stab 13 innocent people at Ohio State University last November. He and his family left Somalia in 2007 and moved to Pakistan, arriving in the US in 2014. He was a legal permanent resident. His attack would not count using the more narrow definition. \\"In most cases, the American people don't hear about these cases,\\" the senior White House official said, \\"but these cases have required thousands of man-hours by law enforcement in any number of plots to commit terrorism against this country. The threat is very jarring.\\" The White House official said the Obama administration tried to downplay the threat while the Trump administration believes in a culture of \\"very robust disclosure.\\" Asked about the report Thursday on \\"The Lead,\\" Rep. Dan Donovan, R-New York, emphasized that the intelligence community be nonpartisan. \\"They should take data, take information, shouldn't interpret it in a political way and provide the President the information he needs to make decisions to protect our country,\\" he said. Also commenting on the report was Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who acknowledged that he hadn't seen the specifics but \\"it looks wrong to me.\\" \\"We ought to be doing the intel first, then set the policy and in large part based upon the intelligence,\\" Haass said. \\"If these reports are true, it's yet another example where this administration is having real trouble forging a functional relationship with the intelligence community.\\" UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect new information from the Department of Homeland Security. ||||| WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s executive order to temporarily ban entry from seven Middle Eastern and African countries states that it is intended to “protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” However, few of the dozens of plots in the U.S. during and after 2001 were attempted or carried out by suspects who came from the countries targeted under the ban.

A report requested by the president has found that citizenship is an “unlikely indicator” of terrorism threat in the US, with little evidence linking those countries to terrorist activity in the US since Syria's civil war began in 2011."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well. When the other children experience pain, they simply use their powers to inflict the same pain on the adult responsible for the pain, for example forcing one of the mothers to put one of her arms in a pot full of boiling water, or forcing the local optometrist making... My question: Where is Alan going to detonate the briefcase of explosives? Answer:","completion":"In the cinematic adaptation of \\"Village of the Damned,\\" Dr. Alan Chaffee is deeply troubled by the mysterious children's destructive powers and recognizes the need to stop their reign of terror. To do so, he devises a plan to detonate a briefcase of explosives in their stronghold, where the children convene and, to some extent, feel safe. Although it's not explicitly mentioned where Alan plans to detonate the explosives, one could surmise that he might choose a location central to the children's gathering, such as their school or the primary building where they live. This would enable him to target the dangerous children more effectively and minimize collateral damage to other townspeople. To ensure success, Alan might attempt to deceive the cunning children by projecting thoughts of a harmless subject. In the original 1960 film, the protagonist, George Sanders, utilized this tactic by concentrating intensely on a brick wall to distract the children from his true intentions. By employing such methods, Alan hopes to save the town, his troubled child David, and other innocents from the psychic malice of these unearthly beings. However, his plan's outcome can only be revealed once the events of the story unfold on screen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In English, the word \\"biotiini\\" translates to \\"biotin.\\" Biotin, also known as vitamin H or vitamin B7, is a water-soluble vitamin that belongs to the B-complex family. Biotin plays a vital role in various metabolic processes in the human body, including the conversion of nutrients into energy, the synthesis of fatty acids, and the production of certain amino acids. It also contributes to the health of the skin, hair, and nails. Biotin deficiency, though rare, can lead to hair loss, skin rashes, and brittle nails. Natural sources of biotin include organ meats (such as liver and kidney), egg yolks, dairy products, fish, nuts, seeds, and some fruits and vegetables, including avocados and sweet potatoes. Biotin can also be synthesized by the bacteria present in the human gut, although the exact contribution of this source to the overall biotin intake is not well established. Biotin supplements are available in markets, and they are often used to improve the health and appearance of hair, skin, and nails. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any supplement to ensure that it is appropriate for your specific health needs and to determine the proper dosage. In summary, \\"biotiini\\" is a Finnish word that translates to \\"biotin\\" in English. Biotin is an essential B-vitamin that plays a critical role in various bodily functions, and it is necessary for maintaining the health of hair, skin, and nails."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Press release Hitting rock bottom: Children's suffering in Syria at its worst - UNICEF © UNICEF/UN027725/Al-Issa On 5 August 2016 in Aleppo city in the Syrian Arab Republic, displaced families from Reyadeh and 1070 neighbourhoods take shelter at the Teshreen Kindergarten in western Aleppo city. Download multimedia assets from: http://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AMZIFDMAU4 – Grave violations against children in Syria were the highest on record in 2016, said UNICEF in a grim assessment of the conflict’s impact on children, as the war reaches six years. Verified instances of killing, maiming and recruitment of children increased sharply last year in a drastic escalation of violence across the country. • At least 652 children were killed – a 20 per cent increase from 2015 – making 2016 the worst year for Syria’s children since the formal verification of child casualties began in 2014. • 255 children were killed in or near a school. • More than 850 children were recruited to fight in the conflict, more than double the number recruited in 2015. Children are being used and recruited to fight directly on the frontlines and are increasingly taking part in combat roles, including in extreme cases as executioners, suicide bombers or prison guards. • There were at least 338 attacks against hospitals and medical personnel . “The depth of suffering is unprecedented. Millions of children in Syria come under attack on a daily basis, their lives turned upside down,” said Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa speaking from Homs, Syria. “Each and every child is scarred for life with horrific consequences on their health, well-being and future.” Challenges in access in several parts of Syria stand in the way of assessing the full scale of children’s suffering and of urgently getting humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable girls and boys. Beyond the bombs, bullets and explosions, children are dying in silence often from diseases that can otherwise be easily prevented. Access to medical care, lifesaving supplies and other basic services remains difficult. The most vulnerable among Syria’s children are the 2.8 million in hard-to-reach areas, including 280,000 children living under siege, almost completely cut off from humanitarian aid. After six years of war, nearly 6 million children now depend on humanitarian assistance, a twelve-fold increase from 2012. Millions of children have been displaced, some up to seven times. Over 2.3 million children are now living as refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Inside Syria and across its borders, coping mechanisms are eroding, and families are taking extreme measures just to survive, often pushing children into early marriage and child labour. In more than two thirds of households, children are working to support their families, some in extremely harsh conditions unfit even for adults. Yet despite the horrors and suffering, there are many remarkable stories of children determined to pursue their hopes and aspirations. Darsy (12), now a refugee in Turkey said: “I want to be a surgeon to help the sick and injured people of Syria. I dream of a Syria without a war so we can go home. I dream of a world without any wars.” “We continue to witness the courage of Syria’s children. Many have crossed frontlines just to sit for school exams. They insist on learning, including in underground schools. There is so much more we can and should do to turn the tide for Syria’s children,” said Cappelaere. On behalf of the children of Syria, UNICEF is appealing to all parties to the conflict, those who have influence over them, the international community and anyone who cares about children for: • An immediate political solution to end the conflict in Syria; • An end to all grave violations against children including killing, maiming and recruitment, and attacks on schools and hospitals; • The lifting of all sieges and unconditional and sustained access to all children in need, wherever they are in Syria; • Providing refugee host governments and communities with sustainable support for vulnerable children, regardless of their status, and • Continued financial support for UNICEF’s lifesaving assistance to Syrian children. # About UNICEF UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.

(Associated Press) BEIRUT (AP) — In Syria, last year was the worst yet for the country's rising generation, with at least 652 children killed in 2016, the United Nations' child relief agency said Monday. There was no letup to attacks on schools, hospitals, playgrounds, parks and homes as the Syrian government, its opponents and the allies of both sides showed callous disregard for the laws of war. UNICEF said at least 255 children were killed in or near schools last year and 1.7 million youngsters are out of school. One of every three schools in Syria is unusable, some because armed groups occupy them. An additional 2.3 million Syrian children are refugees elsewhere in the Middle East. The figures came in a UNICEF report released ahead of the sixth anniversary later this week of the 2011 popular uprising against President Bashar Assad's rule. The uprising, which was part of the Arab Spring movements across the Mideast, quickly escalated into full-blown civil war. Children were among the first victims of the government's brutal crackdown. On March 15, 2011, a small demonstration broke out in the capital of Damascus and three days later, residents in the southern Syrian city of Daraa marched to demand the release of teenage students arrested for writing anti-government slogans on their school's walls. They were tortured in detention. The UNICEF report warns that for Syria's young generation, coping mechanisms and medical care are eroding quickly, driving children into child labor, early marriage and combat. Dozens of children are also dying from preventable diseases. A report released a week ago by the international charity Save the Children said Syrian youngsters are showing signs of \\"toxic stress\\" that can lead to lifelong health problems, struggles with addiction and mental disorders lasting into adulthood. The use of child soldiers is on the rise in Syria, UNICEF also said. At least 851 children were recruited by armed factions last year — more than twice compared to the year before. Children across the country are at risk of severe injury while playing around land mines and cluster munitions. Demining operations in opposition-held areas have been severely hampered by inaccessibility to outside experts. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Refugee Council said that as the sixth year of Syria's conflict nears its end, 13.5 million people remain in need of aid in dire and deteriorating conditions. Half as many are displaced in their own country, with almost 5 million refugees in neighboring countries where conditions keep getting increasingly desperate. \\"Over the last year in Syria, all parties involved have blocked vital aid supplies and millions have become poorer, hungrier and more isolated from assistance and from the world,\\" said NRC's Mideast director, Carsten Hansen. \\"We join the rest of the international humanitarian community on this milestone of shame to voice outrage at the plight of millions of civilians living in a downward spiral of despair,\\" the organization added. It said parties to the conflict continue using siege and starvation as a weapon of war. Around 5 million people remain trapped in areas of active fighting, including almost one million in besieged areas who have no access to sustained humanitarian assistance. ___ Associated Press Writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In Syria, 2016 was the worst year so far for children, with at least 652 killed, according to the United Nations children's relief agency, UNICEF.

The 27-year-old shared a 67-run second-wicket partnership with New Zealand all-rounder Sophie Devine (41) before the latter was bowled by Anya Shrubsole. Two late boundaries from South African Sune Luus looked to have led the Diamonds to a challenging total. However, Priest - who had managed just three runs in her first two Super League innings - scored a majestic and at times brutal hundred, ending the match with back-to-back boundaries. On a rain-affected day at the Ageas Bowl, Surrey Stars maintained their unbeaten start to the competition after edging to a four-run victory over holders Southern Vipers on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method. Hayley Matthews removed Surrey's England opener Tammy Beaumont for a duck, but South African pair Lizelle Lee (40) and Marizanne Kapp (42) took the visitors to 127-8 on a slow wicket. The Vipers' reply was hampered by a regular loss of wickets, as Stars captain Nat Sciver trapped Arran Brindle lbw, ran out Georgia Adams and bowled Charlotte Edwards for a duck, all in the space of 10 balls. New Zealand captain Suzie Bates, who scored the first Super League century in her previous innings, continued her fine form as she hit an unbeaten half-century.

Previously, the Borgata was a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Boyd Gaming, which is an American casino and hotel operating company. When the property first opened in 2003, it was at the time the largest hotel in Atlantic City, and MGM and Boyd each owned a 50% stake in the joint venture. However, in August 2010, MGM Resorts International announced that they would sell their stake in the Borgata and related properties due to licensing issues with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Although they were attempting to find a buyer for their shares, the sale never materialized. In September 2014, MGM cleared the concerns raised by the authorities, which led to their reinvestment rights being reinstated. As a result, MGM began to buy out Boyd Gaming's 50% interest in the Borgata. In 2016, MGM Resorts International acquired Boyd Gaming's stake, making MGM the sole owner of the casino and hotel. The deal was finalized on August 1, 2016, for a cash consideration of 900 million. Since becoming the sole owner, MGM Resorts International has undertaken a series of renovations and investment projects in the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa to maintain its image as a premier gaming and entertainment destination in Atlantic City. Furthermore, MGM Resorts International integrated the Borgata into their M life Rewards loyalty program, connecting the property with their extensive portfolio of hotels and resorts across the United States.

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\" Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"China\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which two powers during World War Two were likely racing to develop the first nuclear weapons?\\"?

Text messages have exploded in popularity, particularly among young people. The trade group for the wireless industry, CTIA, estimates more than 48 billion text messages are sent each month. The plan stems from the Warning Alert and Response Network Act, a 2006 federal law that requires upgrades to the emergency alert system. The act requires the Federal Communications Commission to develop ways to alert the public about emergencies. “The ability to deliver accurate and timely warnings and alerts through cellphones and other mobile services is an important next step in our efforts to help ensure that the American public has the information they need to take action to protect themselves and their families prior to, and during, disasters and other emergencies,” the commission chairman, Kevin J. Martin, said after the plan was approved. Carriers’ participation in the system, which has strong support from the industry, is voluntary. Cellphone customers would be able to opt out of the program.

Specification of illumination requirements is the basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task. Clearly, much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a word processing work station. Generally speaking, the energy expended is proportional to the design illumination level. For example, a lighting level of 400 lux might be chosen for a work environment involving meeting rooms and conferences, whereas a level of 80 lux could be selected for building hallways. If the hallway standard simply emulates the conference room needs, then much more energy will be consumed than is needed. Unfortunately, most of the lighting standards even today have been specified by industrial groups who manufacture and sell lighting, so that a historical commercial bias exists in designing most building lighting, especially for office and industrial settings. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What is a basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task?","completion":"The basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task is specification of illumination requirements.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What did the Supreme Court determine in Dred Scott v. Sandford? Suggested answer: Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent. Should I validate this answer? Available options: (a). No. (b). Yes. A:","completion":"(a). No. The answer suggested is incomplete and misleading as it jumps directly to the 14th Amendment and omits crucial information pertaining to the actual case. Dred Scott v. Sandford was a monumental case for the United States Supreme Court occurring in 1857, and its decision had significant implications on the state of slavery and citizenship in the country at that time. The case involved Dred Scott, an enslaved man who was taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state, and later to a territory where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise. After returning to Missouri with his owner, Scott later sued for his freedom, arguing that his time spent in the free territory made him a free man. The Supreme Court, in a 7-to-2 decision, ruled against Dred Scott. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, had two main conclusions: 1. African Americans, whether they were enslaved or free, could not claim U.S. citizenship and were therefore unable to petition the courts for their freedom. 2. The Missouri Compromise was found to be unconstitutional, as the federal government couldn't prohibit slavery in certain territories because it would infringe upon the property rights of slave owners under the Fifth Amendment. These rulings intensified the national debate over slavery and contributed to the deepening divide between the North and South, which ultimately played a role in the subsequent Civil War. It is accurate that the passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1868 superseded and invalidated the Dred Scott decision, as it granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S., including formerly enslaved individuals. However, the answer should primarily focus on the core aspects of the Supreme Court's determination in the case before mentioning the 14th Amendment's impact on the ruling. A complete and appropriate answer would be: The Supreme Court determined in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, were not considered U.S. citizens and therefore could not sue for their freedom in federal courts. Additionally, the Court ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional as it violated slave owners' property rights under the Fifth Amendment. This decision intensified the national debate over slavery and contributed to the growing divide between the North and South. The passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 ultimately invalidated the rulings from the Dred Scott case, granting citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, including former slaves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What are the full names of the characters who learn that Serena cannot bear children? Answer the above question based on the context below: In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat. One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life. Having problems with her pregnancy, Serena and George rush to the hospital after Serena experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries. They learn that she can never again bear children. Things continue to grow worse, and Rachel's baby becomes more obvious to Serena. A:","completion":"Based on the given context, the characters who learn that Serena cannot bear children are George Pemberton, Serena Shaw, and potentially other characters like Campbell (George's worker), Sheriff McDowell, and significant medical staff at the hospital. However, it is important to clarify that the text does not explicitly mention the people who learn about Serena's condition other than George Pemberton and Serena Shaw herself. Therefore, it certainly depends on who is around during the narrative or who they might choose to share this personal information with after they find out. George Pemberton, the ambitious timber baron, is the husband of Serena. Even though he has an illegitimate son with Rachel, he deeply cares about Serena. When Serena experiences complications with her pregnancy, they rush to the hospital, where they learn about her inability to bear children. Serena Shaw Pemberton is George's wife. Coming from a sad past, she quickly takes control of things in their relationship and business. However, when she experiences heavy bleeding and pain, they go to the hospital, where she learns that she can never again bear children. This information is especially impactful for Serena, considering her competitive nature and apparent worry over George's illegitimate son, Jacob, and his mother, Rachel. George's feelings of responsibility towards Jacob, reflected in his monetary gifts to Rachel, might further exacerbate Serena's anxieties and feelings of inadequacy due to her inability to bear children. The fact that Serena cannot bear children might be learned by Campbell, a worker of George, who seems to be in close circles with him. Campbell witnessed George's potential act of murder, signifying his proximity to the main events. Another person who could potentially learn about Serena's condition is Sheriff McDowell, who showed interest in George's land and was informal contact with Buchanan, George's former business partner. Medical staff at the hospital who took care of Serena when she was rushed due to heavy bleeding and pain would also know about her condition. It's important to note that these names are speculative beyond Serena Shaw and George Pemberton as the text does not provide explicit details on who else is informed about Serena's infertility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have an equation: -88 * i - 360 = 80. We want to find out what 'i' is. First, let's add 360 to both sides. (-88 * i - 360) + 360 = 80 + 360 -88 * i = 440 (because 80 + 360 = 440) Now, we simply need to figure out what 'i' is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -88. (-88 * i) / -88 = 440 / -88 'i' equals -5 (440 / -88 = -5) So, our final answer is: i = -5.

If you have an older friend or family member who's good at a sport, you might ask him or her to help you practice.

His curiosity leads him to decipher the alien message, which inadvertently makes Earth visible to the extraterrestrial beings known as the Zeivrons. These mysterious aliens send a group of emissaries hidden from plain sight to Earth. Their mission is to observe humanity and evaluate the potential threat it poses to their civilization, as well as to ensure that their existence remains a secret. Through their advanced technology, they have the power to erase memories and even take control of human minds. As the Zeivrons conduct their research, they stumble upon Larry Storch, the very man who deciphered their signals. The aliens quickly realize that he is the only person capable of understanding their technology and potentially revealing their presence on Earth. They decide to eliminate him to protect their mission and existence. However, Larry has been working tirelessly in decoding further messages from the Zeivrons and was able to gather some information about them. Sensing the potential danger he is in, he confides in his best friend Dr. Maria Watson, a talented cryptologist. Together, they race against time to uncover the Zeivrons' intentions and find a way to reveal their infiltration to the world. As they dig deeper into the alien's secret, they are pursued by alien assassins who will stop at nothing to fulfill their duty. Agent Jack Harper, a skillful and cunning detective, gets entangled in the hunters' path when he stumbles upon the unusual case of Larry Storch. Always a skeptic, Jack is initially reluctant to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial beings. However, when he starts investigating the trail of bizarre incidents connected to Larry, he becomes an essential ally to Larry and Maria. The trio must work together to expose the alien invaders, ultimately leading to a nail-biting confrontation. As they make their last stand against the stealthy assassins, Larry sacrifices himself to give Maria and Jack the chance they need to reveal the alien threat to the world. Larry Storch may have been killed by the Zeivron assassins, but his dedication to unveiling the truth, along with Maria and Jack's unwavering efforts, enable the world to see the invisible threat from the stars.

Question 1: How do I know if I am a lesbian trapped in a man's body or just an effeminate male? This question is about figuring out your identity. Imagine you have a big box of colors. There are many colors, like red, blue, green, and yellow. Now imagine your identity is like the colors in that box. You're trying to find the color that best describes you. A \\"lesbian trapped in a man's body\\" means that even though you have a boy's body, you feel like a girl inside who is attracted to other girls. An \\"effeminate male\\" means you're a boy who has some qualities that people usually think are more like a girl's qualities, but you still feel like and identify as a boy.

Next question: who owns the rights to destroy all humans?","completion":"The rights to the video game \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" are owned by THQ Nordic, a video game publisher based in Austria. THQ Nordic GmbH, had acquired said rights after a series of acquisitions and mergers. To give you a more in-depth perspective, I'd like to further explore how THQ Nordic came into the possession of these rights. \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" was originally developed by Pandemic Studios and was first published by THQ (Toy Headquarters) in 2005. This was a single-player action-adventure game where the player controls Cryptosporidium 137 – a member of an alien species – who has come to Earth to harvest DNA from humans to continue cloning his species. THQ faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy in December 2012. During the bankruptcy proceedings, instead of selling the company as a whole, its assets including the franchises, studios, and publishing contracts were sold separately. A lot of well-known games fell into new hands during this process and \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" was among these. Specifically, it was acquired by Nordic Games (now THQ Nordic) in 2013 during one of these auctions. Later, THQ Nordic rebranded itself, adopting the name of THQ to reflect and leverage the legacy of the brand. As of now, under THQ Nordic, the franchise has seen a revival with the release of the remake \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" in 2020, maintaining the ownership of the rights. It's important to note that the ownership of the rights to a game title includes the right to its intellectual property, images, storyline, characters, and more. These rights give THQ Nordic the exclusive ability to develop new games under the \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" title, create merchandise, authorize the production of related media like adaptations, and more. In summary, THQ Nordic, an Austrian game publisher, owns the rights to the \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" franchise through a path of various acquisitions and mergers. They can continue to use this title to make new games, merchandises, or adaptations, preserving the legacy of this much loved alien-themed game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And in a parenting culture that's increasingly concerned with centering children's needs above all else, mothers and fathers have become skillful at talking about their kids' feelings while masking their own. But new research suggests that parents who hide their negative emotions are doing their children, and themselves harm. A study published this month says that when parents put on a faux-happy face for their kids, they do damage to their own sense of wellbeing and authenticity. \\"For the average parent the findings suggest when they attempt to hide their negative emotion expression and overexpress their positive emotions with their children, it actually comes at a cost: doing so may lead parents to feel worse themselves,\\" researcher Dr Emily Impett, says. It makes sense that parents often fall back on amping up the positivity for the sake of their children--there are a lot of things in the world we want to protect our kids from.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON (Reuters)  The number of new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and regional manufacturing activity slipped in January, hinting at some slowing in the economic recovery. The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 36,000 last week, to 482,000, as a backlog of applications from the holidays was processed. It was the third consecutive week that claims rose. Analysts had expected new claims to slip to 440,000. Separate data showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in January to a three-month low, while a gauge of economic prospects set a record high last month. “The recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but it’s at a slower pace than we have seen at the end of 2009. The biggest problem is companies remain reluctant to expand their capacities, which is weighing on the labor market,” said Harm Bandholz, an economist at Unicredit Research in New York. Analysts say they believe the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 2.2 percent rate in the July-September period. The Labor Department said the jump in initial claims for jobless aid last week was administrative and not economic. At least one analyst, however, interpreted the data differently. “That implies claims in previous weeks were understated, so the reduction in new jobless claims between December and January is not as extreme as had been thought,” said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. “But with layoffs diminishing, the labor market is still gradually healing.” Analysts were not too troubled by the drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank’s business activity index, which fell to 15.2 this month as orders declined. The index, which measures factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region, hit a four-and-a-half-year high of 22.5 in December. Markets had expected the index for January to come in at 18. A reading above zero indicates growth in the region’s manufacturing sector. The survey’s employment index rose to its highest level since February 2008. “The data still point to growth in activity this month, and we don’t see any need to significantly alter our view that the factory sector is shifting from being on the mend to steady expansion,” said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn. Bolstering views that the recovery remains intact, the Conference Board, a business research group, said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1.1 percent last month, to a record high of 106.4. Although the Labor Department report also showed that the four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a measure of underlying trends, ended 19 weeks of declines last week, it remained below the 450,000 level analysts consider to indicate stability in the labor market. The number of workers still collecting benefits after an initial week of aid fell to the lowest since January 2009. The drop probably reflected people exhausting their unemployment benefits rather than a pickup in hiring. There were 5.9 million people receiving extended benefits under special programs at the beginning of January.

Multi-choice problem: Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Phineas knows a girl who is jealous of Maxime. 1). unacceptable 2). acceptable","completion":"The next sentence, \\"Phineas knows a girl who is jealous of Maxime,\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. To analyze the sentence further, let us break it down into its individual components: 1. Syntactic acceptability: Syntactic acceptability refers to the structure and arrangement of words in a sentence according to the rules of grammar. In this case, the sentence follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, which is a common sentence structure in the English language. The sentence has a clear subject \\"Phineas\\", a main verb \\"knows\\", and an object \\"girl.\\" In addition, the relative clause \\"who is jealous of Maxime\\" provides additional information about the object. The relative clause also follows the SVO structure with \\"who\\" as the subject, \\"is\\" as the verb, and \\"jealous\\" as the object complement followed by a prepositional phrase \\"of Maxime.\\" Thus, the sentence structure follows the rules of English grammar, making it syntactically acceptable. 2. Semantic acceptability: Semantic acceptability refers to the meaning and coherence of a sentence. In this case, the sentence conveys a logical and understandable message – that Phineas is aware of a girl who seems to be envious or resentful of someone named Maxime for some reason. The words in the sentence are used correctly, and their combination conveys a meaningful and coherent idea. Consequently, the sentence is semantically acceptable. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Phineas knows a girl who is jealous of Maxime\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Therefore, the correct answer to the multi-choice problem is option 2). acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin.

Write a title for this article: Corey Lee, an immigration lawyer in Manhattan, said: “If you didn’t go to a class for a year, you should expect something is going on.” Ms. Sun, 29, earned a master’s degree in art therapy at a Massachusetts college and moved to New York to work for a nonprofit social services agency. (She declined to name the college or the organization because she did not want to endanger her application for a waiver to return to the United States.) Her employer applied for an H-1B visa for her, but she faced a gap of several months before it would come through. Ms. Sun said her broker told her she could work instead of taking classes, but referred her to the university. In February 2015, after she enrolled, Ms. Sun said she called there approximately 20 times; no one responded. “If one person called me back and told me it was fake, I would not have gone to the University of Northern New Jersey,” Ms. Sun said. “What else can I do? I don’t know the American system.” Louis Farrell, the director of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, part of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said academic nonimmigrant student visas require the holder “to enroll in a full course of study and attend and pass all their classes” and that “they should be wary of any recruiter who promises they can work without restrictions while attending school.” But there seem to be inconsistencies in the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services’ definition of a “full course of study.” In one entry on its website, it says that the designated school officer can determine a full course of study. Farther down, it says that a student must complete at least 18 hours of classroom study. Ultimately, the students said that because the Department of Homeland Security’s website certified the University of Northern New Jersey, they believed the institution was legitimate. In addition, the website of the New Jersey Education Department listed it as approved. So did the website of the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, a national body. Its director, Michale S. McComis, later said he had certified the university in order to cooperate with the government’s investigation. Z., who is 27 and also from China, did not win the H-1B lottery. He found the University of Northern New Jersey online without a broker. “How risky will it be for obtaining full-time C.P.T. without attending any classes?” he wrote to the university in an email he showed to The New York Times, referring to Curricular Practical Training. The response, from the generic info@unnj.edu: “If you are not comfortable with what we have offered, I ask you to try another university in the New Jersey area.” Without a direct answer, Z. said he fell back on the university’s government accreditation. A year passed. When he asked how he would provide evidence for another H-1B application, the university suggested making up classes from a template, and to send it in with 620. That was the final flag. Unlike students who were listed as co-conspirators, Z. did not fabricate school transcripts. Instead, he transferred. But on April 5, his student status was terminated because he had been enrolled at the fake university for more than 45 days. K., a 30-year-old from China who earned an M.B.A. in New England, began to suspect something about the university after he had worked for a year and did not hear about the start of classes. “I was wondering if there was a lecture or something I could attend,” he said. His broker told him online classes were coming soon. K. said that he, too, relied on the university’s accreditations. “If the government is not trustworthy, who should we trust?” he said. His girlfriend, S., 26, whom he met at business school, was accepted to the university the next year, in January 2016. But she said the broker told her that her authorization form and the school schedule would be delayed while the university expanded to two more campuses. The couple went to the campus in Cranford in March, only to find the doors locked, supposedly because it was spring break. Then at 8:20 a.m. on April 5, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents knocked on the door of their rural New England home. K. and S. were detained in separate cells for several hours. The next day, K. resigned from his job at a local company. They are both waiting for hearing dates. Like the other students, they were notified that they needed to leave the country or apply for reinstatement of their student visas. But students have said that few colleges, if any, have been willing to sponsor them after they were tainted by the University of Northern New Jersey. Reinstatement ultimately depends on the government’s approval. The students say they have been put in an untenable position financially. They paid thousands of dollars either to brokers or directly to the university. Eight students alone said they spent a combined 46,000. Some paid the university via PayPal or cash, with the money going to a holding company listed on some students’ invoices: Waterfall Properties. As they wait for a hearing in immigration court that could take a year or longer, they cannot legally work. “Typically in any fraud investigation, it is our policy that we do not refund any money,” Mr. Phillips, the Homeland Security spokesman, said. “Absolutely there was a message,” Mr. Phillips added. “We welcome international students in America, but they must do so according to the standards, the right way.” But Barmak Nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, wondered why government officials bothered to create a fake university when such places already existed. Several fraudulent universities have been shut down in previous years. The brokers may have recognized the University of Northern New Jersey as a visa mill, Mr. Nassirian said, but he could see how some students could be deceived by its certifications. “Can you really blame a student,” he said, “even if they are a little greedy, a little gullible, or a little too hopeful?” Title:","completion":"Unwitting Students Caught in the Web of a Fake University and Immigration Crackdown"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trophic levels are the positions that an organism occupies in a food chain, and they help to understand the flow of energy and the transfer of nutrients among the organisms in an ecosystem. The main trophic levels include: 1. Primary producers (autotrophs): These are organisms that produce their own food, primarily through the process of photosynthesis. They convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy in the form of glucose, which they utilize to create their own biomass. Examples include plants, algae, and some bacteria. 2. Primary consumers (herbivores): These organisms feed directly on primary producers. They consume the energy stored in the producers' biomass and convert it into their own biomass through the process of consumption. Examples of primary consumers include insects, grazing mammals like deer, and herbivorous fish. 3. Secondary consumers (carnivores): These organisms feed on primary consumers. They gain energy by consuming the biomass of herbivores and transferring it to their own bodies. Examples of secondary consumers include small predators like birds, reptiles, and some fish species. 4. Tertiary consumers (top predators): These organisms feed on secondary consumers, often referred to as apex predators. They occupy the highest position in the food chain and have few, if any, natural predators. Examples include lions, wolves, and sharks. Decomposers and detritivores also play a significant role in food webs by breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. They are not part of the trophic levels, but they are essential in maintaining the ecosystem's balance. In summary, the answer to your question is trophic levels. These levels help categorize the different feeding positions organisms occupy in food chains or webs, ultimately providing insight into energy transfer and nutrient cycling within ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tillis, who was backed by many mainstream Republicans, topped 40% of the primary vote Tuesday, avoiding a runoff in July.

The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west.

(CNN) -- The company that produced the peanut butter linked to a nationwide salmonella outbreak said late Tuesday that it was voluntarily recalling all products made in its Blakely, Georgia, plant. Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. The Peanut Corporation of America, a peanut processing company, made the peanut butter sold by King Nut company. Health officials in Minnesota have said that salmonella they linked to an open container of King Nut peanut butter was the same strain of bacteria responsible for the apparently ongoing outbreak, which has infected at least 434 people in 43 states. However, the King Nut product is unlikely to be responsible for the entire outbreak, since it distributes its peanut butter only to food service companies in just seven states: Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, Arizona, Idaho and New Hampshire. So, the Peanut Corporation of America said it was voluntarily recalling all peanut butter produced in its Blakely plant \\"out of an abundance of caution.\\" Some of it is distributed to another company. What you need to know about food poisoning ». \\"We deeply regret that this has happened,\\" company president Stewart Parnell said. Over the past few days, Food and Drug Administration inspectors visited the Blakely plant, where they took hundreds of samples for testing, Parnell said. The salmonella outbreak has been spreading across much of the country since September. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium played a role in the deaths of an elderly person from southwestern Virginia and an adult from northern Virginia. The third death was a nursing home resident in her 70s in Minnesota. All three of the patients who died had underlying illnesses that could have contributed to their deaths, state officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a written statement, has called peanut butter \\"a likely source\\" of the infections. But it said that no association had been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores. The first cases of salmonella were reported September 3, but most occurred between October 1 and January 6, the CDC said. About 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness, and patients have ranged from 2 months to 98 years of age. CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said a preliminary analysis suggests peanut butter as a likely source of the outbreak. No cases connected to the outbreak have been reported in Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida or Alaska. Very young people, older people and those with compromised immune systems are most vulnerable to severe side effects of salmonella infection, including death, health officials have said. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A company that made peanut butter had a problem because some of it had bad germs called salmonella. These germs can make people sick if they eat contaminated food. The company decided to take back all the peanut butter they made at their factory in Georgia to make sure people stay safe. Some people got sick from these germs, and very old or very young people can get more sick than others.

In both games, White kept finding his receiver, OPTIONS: - Atlanta, in the clutch. - Atlanta Falcons, in the clutch. - CNN, in the clutch. - Danny White, in the clutch. - Drew Pearson, in the clutch. - Eugene Robinson, in the clutch. - Falcons, in the clutch. - Georgia Dome, in the clutch. - Lambeau Field South, in the clutch. - Michael Vick, in the clutch. - NFL, in the clutch. - National Football League, in the clutch. - Seahawks, in the clutch. - Seattle Seahawks, in the clutch. - Super Bowl, in the clutch. - Super Bowl XXXIII, in the clutch.","completion":"- Drew Pearson, in the clutch. In this passage, the correct answer is \\"Drew Pearson, in the clutch.\\" This is because the passage discusses notable events during the Atlanta Falcons' history, and Danny White finding Drew Pearson refers to a specific game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Dallas Cowboys. Now, let's talk about why the other options are wrong: - Atlanta, Atlanta Falcons, Falcons, Georgia Dome, Lambeau Field South, Seahawks, Seattle Seahawks, Super Bowl, Super Bowl XXXIII, National Football League, and NFL are wrong because they are all talking about teams, locations, or leagues, not a specific player in a situation. - CNN is wrong because it's a news network and has nothing to do with the player's performance. - Danny White is incorrect because he is the one who found the receiver, not the receiver himself. - Eugene Robinson and Michael Vick are wrong because they weren't mentioned in the passage at all. So, in conclusion, the correct answer is \\"Drew Pearson, in the clutch\\" because it refers to the game and situation that the passage alludes to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Find the elements of A from the ith to jth elements: Since i = 2 and j = 4, we need to find the elements of A that are at indices 2 to 4 (inclusive). The list A is ['s', 'M', '273', 'h', 'k', '7949'], so the elements from index 2 to 4 are ['273', 'h', 'k']. 2.

Mohammad Amir, the convicted spot-fixer, has been cleared for an early return to domestic cricket in Pakistan by the International Cricket Council. Amir, 22, was jailed and banned from the sport for five years for his part in a spot-fixing scandal during his country's 2010 tour of England. The prodigiously talented seam bowler, who delivered pre-arranged no-balls at Lord's as part of a plot involving Mohammad Asif and Pakistan captain Salman Butt, was not due to play again until September 2. Mohammad Amir has been cleared by the ICC to make an early return to Pakistan domestic cricket. Amir was involved in the spot-fixing scandal during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010. But after a meeting of the ICC Board in Dubai, it has been announced that the governing body, the PCB, and anti-corruption chief Sir Ronnie Flanagan had approved his domestic availability with immediate effect. An ICC statement read: 'The ACSU chairman, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, with the prior approval of the ICC Board and the Pakistan Cricket Board, has exercised his discretion to allow Mohammad Amir to return to domestic cricket played under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board with immediate effect. 'Amir's five-year ban is scheduled to expire on 2 September 2015. The ACSU chairman had exercised the powers vested in him under Article 6.8 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code after he was satisfied that Amir had cooperated with the ACSU by fully disclosing his part in the matters that led to his disqualification, admitting his guilt, showing remorse and cooperating with the unit's ongoing investigations and by recording messages for the ACSU education sessions.' In the aftermath of the spot-fixing scandal, Amir distinguished himself from his co-conspirators by admitting his guilt and showing remorse. Asif and Butt repeatedly fought charges before being found guilty at Southwark Crown Court. The latter pair were also jailed, with Asif banned from cricket for seven years (two suspended) and Butt 10 years (five suspended). TV footage showing Amir bowling a no-ball during a Test match at Lord's in 2010. With Pakistan's first-class season already at an end and the limited-overs President's Cup finishing early next month, Amir may have to wait some time for his first competitive cricket. But the end of his ban allows him to make a full return to training and net practice, possibly overseen by the PCB, and even club cricket should the opportunity arise. It also increases his prospects of an international recall against England, of all teams. They take on Pakistan in a three-format tour of the United Arab Emirates in October, leaving Amir plenty of time to prove himself ready for selection. Quite how that would go down with the likes of Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Eoin Morgan and Steven Finn - current England players who were on duty in that fateful Lord's Test - remains to be seen. There is also a question mark over Amir's status within the Pakistan dressing room. While the PCB have lobbied hard for his early return and clearly expect him to make a full comeback at the highest level, players who have performed cleanly in the shadow of his indiscretions and those of others, may be less inclined to share the field with Amir. The issue is unlikely to disappear quietly. Should Amir locate anything close to the form that made him the youngest bowler to take 50 Test wickets, he will be back centre stage soon enough and with the possibility of at least a decade of international cricket in front of him. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Mohammad Amir, a talented Pakistani cricket player involved in a spot-fixing scandal during the 2010 tour of England, has been cleared for an early return to domestic cricket in Pakistan by the International Cricket Council (ICC).

Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist.

Background: Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Context: In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomulka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Malgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomulka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership. The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomulka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government. Gomulka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Wladyslaw Gomulka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July. On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomulka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital. Question: What is the Polish Committee of National Liberation?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The Polish Committee of National Liberation (also called PKWN) was a temporary government created by Polish communists during World War II, when Poland was being liberated from German occupation. It was formed to help organize and manage the country as it was being freed from the Nazis. The PKWN was led by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist who worked together with the communists. This group played an important role in shaping Poland's government after the war and was supported by the Soviet Union."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, a U.N. official tells CNN. The Saudi-led coalition -- made up of several Arab countries -- began a military campaign in Yemen in March 2015 aimed at preventing Houthi rebels allied to Iran and forces loyal to Yemen's deposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh from taking power. But last month, a U.N. report claimed the alliance was responsible for 60% of the 1,953 children recorded as killed or maimed in the conflict in 2015 -- a sixfold rise since the previous year. They were added to a blacklist of of groups violating children's rights in armed conflict, before dropping off the list again earlier this week. That's because Saudi Arabia made a threat of a \\"total rupture\\" in relations between the Kingdom and the U.N., placing in doubt hundreds of millions of dollars in financial contributions to U.N. humanitarian agencies and causes, the U.N. official said. Read More ||||| U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon publicly acknowledged Thursday that he removed the Saudi-led coalition currently bombing Yemen from a blacklist of child killers — 72 hours after it was published — due to a financial threat to defund United Nations programs. The secretary-general didn’t name the source of the threat, but news reports have indicated it came directly from the Saudi government. The U.N.’s 2015 “Children and Armed Conflict” report originally listed the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen under “parties that kill or maim children” and “parties that engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals.” The report, which was based on the work of U.N. researchers in Yemen, attributed 60 percent of the 785 children killed and 1,168 injured to the bombing coalition. After loud public objections from the Saudi government, Ban said on Monday that he was revising the report to “review jointly the cases and numbers cited in the text,” in order to “reflect the highest standards of accuracy possible.” But on Thursday, he described his real motivation. “The report describes horrors no child should have to face,” Ban said at a press conference. “At the same time, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many U.N. programs. Children already at risk in Palestine, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and so many other places would fall further into despair.” Saudi Arabia is one of the U.N.’s largest donors in the Middle East, giving hundreds of millions of dollars a year to U.N. food programs in Syria and Iraq. In 2014, Saudi Arabia gave 500 million — the largest single humanitarian donation to the U.N. — to help Iraqis displaced by ISIS. Over the past three years, Saudi Arabia has also been become the third-largest donor to the U.N.’s relief agency in Palestine, giving tens of millions of dollars to help rebuild Gaza and assist Palestinian refugees. “It is unacceptable for member states to exert undue pressure,” the secretary-general said. “Scrutiny is a natural and necessary part of the work of the United Nations.” Ban called the decision “one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make.” Saudi Ambassador to the U.N. Abdallah al-Mouallimi, who held his own press conference afterward, offered his own back-handed confirmation of what happened. “We didn’t use threats,” he said, “but such listing will obviously have an impact on our relations with the U.N.” “It is not in our style, it is not in our genes, it is not in our culture to use threats and intimidation,” he concluded. Ban has invited a team from the Saudi-led coalition to New York to conduct a “joint review” ahead of scheduled U.N. discussions on the report, scheduled for August. On Monday, however, after the changes were announced, the Saudi ambassador to the U.N. declared that the changes were “final and unconditional” and that Saudi Arabia had been “vindicated.” Related: ||||| As organizations working to protect the rights of children and health workers in armed conflict, we are shocked by your decision announced on June 6, 2016 to remove the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition from the “list of shame” annexed to your published 2016 annual report to the United Nations Security Council on children and armed conflict, “pending the conclusions of [a] joint review” of the cases and numbers included in the text. The evidence of grave violations against children in Yemen by the Saudi-led Coalition is overwhelming. The UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism, which operates at multiple levels and gathers, reviews, and verifies information from all relevant UN agencies operating in a country, has documented over a thousand children killed and injured as a result of Saudi-led aerial attacks in Yemen, as well as dozens of airstrikes on schools and hospitals. The listing was based on this information. These findings come in the context of widespread violations of international humanitarian law by Coalition forces in Yemen over the past year. The UN Panel of Experts identified 119 separate coalition sorties that it determined were unlawful. Nongovernmental organizations have similarly documented over 50 cases of indiscriminate or disproportionate airstrikes against civilian objects, including houses, markets, schools, hospitals, and clinics, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of children. Although the exact numbers may be disputed, the responsibility of the Saudi-led coalition for grave violations against children in many of these attacks is not in doubt. Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Coalition members have shown no willingness to credibly investigate alleged war crimes, as they are obligated to do under international humanitarian law. Since the Secretary-General’s “list of shame” was first instituted in 2002, it has been an invaluable tool in efforts to curb violations against children in armed conflict. By stigmatizing perpetrators, whether governments or non-state armed groups, the list creates pressure on parties to armed conflict to comply with international law. Over 20 governments and armed groups have signed UN action plans and taken steps to end violations against children in order to be considered for “de-listing.” Your decision to remove the Saudi-led Coalition from the list – even temporarily pending “review” – following protests by the Saudi government sets a damaging precedent and undermines the list’s credibility. It sends a message to parties to armed conflict that if they apply sufficient political pressure, they can manipulate their exclusion from the list and avoid scrutiny and accountability. Instead, your message should be that all parties to armed conflict—without exception-- are held to the same standard, and that the only route to de-listing is by ending violations against children. If the Saudi-led Coalition wants to be removed from the list, it should stop killing and maiming children and bombing schools and hospitals in Yemen—the violations for which it was listed. By capitulating to the demands of Saudi Arabia, you undermine your Human Rights Up Front initiative and taint your legacy as a proponent of human rights. We urge you to place the Saudi-led Coalition back on the list annexed to your report, and state publicly that your office is committed to an impartial list, based on evidence, not politics. Children whose lives are devastated by armed conflict deserve nothing less.

The context here is that the Saudi Arabia-led coalition was named in an annex to an annual report that is prepared by the Ban Ki Moon’s Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict. The report surveys conflicts around the world in which children are particularly at risk, either because they are serving as child soldiers or the are victims of armed conflict. The report compiles data on the impact of various conflicts on children and adopts a name-and-shame policy of identifying armed groups that are particularly injurious to children. The annex in question lists “parties that recruit or use children, kill or maim children, commit rape and other forms of sexual violence against children, or engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals, or abduct children in situations of armed conflict on the agenda of the Security Council.” In addition to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, four other parties to the conflict in Yemen were named, including Al Qaeda and Houthi rebels. The report offered evidence to back up this designation, saying that 60% of all child casualties could be attributed to the Saudi-led coalition. The United Nations verified a sixfold increase in the number of children killed and maimed compared with 2014, totalling 1,953 child casualties (785 children killed and 1,168 injured). More than 70 per cent were boys. Of the casualties, 60 per cent (510 deaths and 667 injuries) were attributed to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition and 20 per cent (142 deaths and 247 injuries) to the Houthis. In 324 incidents, the responsible party could not be identified. ISIL claimed responsibility for an improvised explosive device attack on a mosque in Amanat al-Asimah that killed seven children and injured six, in addition to causing many adult casualties. Of the child casualties, 60 per cent were caused by air strikes, predominantly in Amanat al-Asimah, Hajjah and Sa‘dah. Significant civilian casualties, including children, as a result of air strikes continued to be documented early in 2016. Ground fighting accounted for 29 per cent of child casualties, with the vast majority in Ta ‘izz, Aden and Dali‘. Child casualties as a result of landmines and explosive remnants of war were documented, with 15 children killed and 67 injured in Abyan, Aden, Amanat al-Asimah, Amran, Bayda’, Dali‘, Dhamar, Lahij, Ma’rib, Sa‘dah, Shabwah and Ta‘izz. Despite this evidence, Saudi Arabia vigorously protested being included in the blacklist. This apparently led to an unusual statement by Ban Ki Moon on Monday, saying that Saudi Arabia would be dropped from the annex, pending a review. That decision faced widespread criticism from human rights groups. Then, yesterday, Colum Lynch reported in Foreign Policy that Saudi Arabia has put the heavy squeeze on Ban Ki Moon. Saudi Arabia threatened this week to break relations with the United Nations and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to its humanitarian relief and counterterrorism programs to strong-arm the U.N. into removing Riyadh and its allies from a blacklist of groups that are accused of harming children in armed conflict…In their Monday warning, senior Saudi diplomats told top U.N. officials Riyadh would use its influence to convince other Arab governments and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to sever ties with the United Nations, the officials said. And now, in the statement to the press today, Ban Ki Moon confirmed that, indeed, countries had threatened to withdraw funding from humanitarian agencies to protest Saudi Arabia’s inclusion on the blacklist. Ban Ki Moon candidly admitted to caving to this pressure in order to prevent children already at risk from “falling into further despair.” My latest report on children and armed conflict has documented the harrowing situation of Yemen’s children. There has been fierce reaction to my decision to temporarily remove the Saudi-led Coalition countries from the report’s annex. This was one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make. The report describes horrors no child should have to face. At the same time, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would de-fund many UN programmes. Children already at risk in Palestine, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and so many other places would fall further into despair. It is unacceptable for Member States to exert undue pressure. Scrutiny is a natural and necessary part of the work of the United Nations. It’s worth nothing that Saudi Arabia is a key funder of UN humanitarian agencies, most importantly it is the fourth largest funder of the United Nations entity that provides relief for Palestinian refugees. This was a threat that could not be easily be dismissed. (For its part, Saudi Arabia denies that it threatened to break ties with the UN.) This is a situation where Ban Ki Moon has little recourse but to rely on the support of UN member states to back him up. This is, after all, a list that member states asked him to create. Back in 2001, the Security Council adopted a resolution requesting an annual report from the office of the Secretary General that lists armed groups that routinely violate the rights of children. That is what he did. And now, he is coming under fire for it. Discussion comments... ||||| Last summer, Mr. Ban reversed course on his list of armies and guerrilla groups that violated child rights in war. In that instance, his special representative for children and armed conflict, Leila Zerrougui, recommended that the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas be included on the list for their role in bombing schools and hospitals and otherwise breaking international law during the 50-day war in the Gaza Strip in 2014. Israel was consulted before the release of the report, Mr. Ban’s aides said at the time, and both Israeli and American diplomats lobbied intensely against the listing. In the end, both Israel and Hamas were kept off the list. Mr. Ban declined to address reporters’ questions on the matter at the time, leaving it to his envoy, Ms. Zerrougui, to explain the redaction. The generally risk-averse Mr. Ban has tried to step out a bit more during his last year, but he has also repeatedly had to step back. In March, on a rare visit to a camp that houses refugees from Western Sahara, Mr. Ban used the term “occupation” to refer to Morocco’s 1975 annexation of territory that the Sahrawis claim as theirs. The Moroccan government responded by ejecting dozens of United Nations staff members, effectively kneecapping the peacekeeping mission there. Morocco has a powerful ally in France, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, which helps explain why the Security Council said nothing to persuade Morocco to reverse its decision. That left Mr. Ban on his own, and within days, his spokesman was compelled to swallow his words. “We regret the misunderstandings and consequences that this personal expression of solicitude provoked,” said the spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric. Perhaps Mr. Ban’s most awkward moment came when he sought to act independently of the United States. In January 2014, he invited Iran to United Nations-brokered political negotiations over Syria, only to be advised by American officials to rescind the invitation, according to interviews with diplomats at the time. ||||| A diplomatic feud between Saudi Arabia and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is escalating. The U.N. chief says the kingdom pressured him into removing the Saudi coalition in Yemen from a blacklist of entitites that harm children during conflicts. “It is unacceptable for member states to exert undue pressure,” Ban told reporters Thursday, in reference to the U.N. report published earlier this week that listed the Saudi Arabia-led coalition as one of the parties that “kill and maim children” and “engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals.” Annual blacklist The Saudis were quick to admonish the United Nations for putting them and their allies on the annual blacklist that includes shady governments such as Bashar al-Assad’s in Syria and Omar al-Bashir’s in Sudan and the Islamic State terror group. Credible reports surfaced that the Saudis and other coalition members threatened to pull their funding from U.N. agencies and humanitarian operations if they were not de-listed, a move that could cripple already cash-strapped life-saving programs, including many serving Arabs and Muslims. Ban appeared to confirm those reports Thursday, telling reporters, “I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would de-fund many U.N. programs.” Horrors children face FILE - A young boy who lost his leg in the Yemen war uses a prosthetic limb at a government-run rehabilitation center in Sanaa, Yemen on March 5, 2016. The U.N. chief said the report on children in armed conflict described “horrors no child should have to face” in Yemen and that it was “one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make” in removing the coalition from the black list. But he insisted the United Nations stands by the report and will not change its content. Saudi Ambassador Abdallah al-Mouallimi strongly rejected characterizations that his government had extorted the secretary-general into removing them from the list. Ban took the coalition off the list on Monday. The U.N. says the removal is pending a review and further consultations with Riyadh; the Saudis have said it is permanent. “I want to reassure you,” the Saudi envoy told reporters, “it is not in our style, it is not in our genes, it is not in our culture, to use threats and intimidation.” He added, “We did not exercise pressure or intimidation. We made our point clear; we made it firmly.” Saudi removal, pending review The Saudis and other Gulf Arab members of the coalition that are fighting Iranian-backed Shi’ite Houthi rebels in Yemen donate hundreds of millions of dollars to U.N. programs, including UNRWA which assists Palestinian refugees and UNICEF. Saudi Arabia is also the third biggest funder of the U.N. humanitarian appeal for Yemen, having pledged more than 46 million for 2016. FILE - Infant Udai Faisal, who died from acute malnutrition on March 24, is one of thousands of Yemeni children who are suffering from hunger as one of the most horrific consequence of the Yemeni conflict and the naval blockade and airstrikes by the Saudi-led coaltion. The report says that nearly 2,000 Yemeni children were killed or injured in 2015, and attributed 60 percent of those casualties to the Saudi-led coalition. The Saudi envoy has called that figure “wildly inaccurate.” The United nations also says that of the 101 verified attacks on schools and hospitals, the Saudi-led coalition is responsible for nearly half. The Children in Armed Conflict Report often irritates governments that are included in it. Last year, the U.N. found itself in a similar situation, as it sought to list Israel for the deaths of nearly 500 Palestinian children in the Gaza war of 2014. Israel succeeded in preventing having its name added to the blacklist before the report’s publication, but was roundly criticized by human rights and Arab groups. |||||Summary:","completion":"A diplomatic feud between the United Nations and Saudi Arabia is escalating after it was revealed that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had included the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen on a blacklist of those that have harmed children during conflicts in a UN report.

Their first show was at the Batschkapp Club in Frankfurt in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and mandolin, Wallinger on keyboards, Roddy Lorimer on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. John Caldwell from Another Pretty Face also played guitar, and Scottish singer Eddi Reader sang backing vocals for the band's first two concerts. The band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material in late 1983 and early 1984 which were released as The Waterboys' second album, A Pagan Place, in June 1984. The \\"official\\" Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of A Pagan Place, was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others. A Pagan Place was preceded by the single The Big Music. \\"The Big Music\\", the name of the single's A-side track, was adopted by some commentators as a description of The Waterboys' sound, and is still used to refer to the musical style of their first three albums. The release of the album was followed by further touring including support for The Pretenders and U2 and a show at the Glastonbury Festival. The band began to record new material in early 1985 for a new album, with Wilkinson leaving the band to join China Crisis. Late in the sessions future Waterboy Steve Wickham added his violin to the track The Pan Within; he had been invited after Scott had heard him on a Sinead O'Connor demo recorded at Karl Wallinger's house. The Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger with a slew of guests) released their third album, This Is the Sea, in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, \\"The Whole of the Moon\\", reached number 26 in the UK. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott's refusal to perform on Top of the Pops, which insisted that its performers lip sync. (However, in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, when the New Wave era started around this period, the group's biggest hit single out of this third album was \\"The Pan Within\\", aside from \\"The Whole of the Moon\\" and \\"Don't Bang The Drum\\".) The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and Chris Whitten replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums. Towards the end of the tour Wallinger left to form his own band, World Party, and was replaced by Guy Chambers. At the same time, drummer Dave Ruffy replaced Chris Whitten.

A herd can go through a forest quietly. It travels in a single line. It goes about 6 miles an hour. When frightened, it may run at about 25 miles an hour. When they reach water, elephants swim across. They are great swimmers. Elephants eat grass, leaves, small branches, and bark. They particularly like the tender leaves on the top of trees. How do they get these leaves? They use their heads to knock trees down. They can easily knock down a 30-foot tree. Elephants also eat berries, mangoes, coconuts, corn, and sugar cane. They love salt. A wild male adult eats 500 to 600 pounds of food a day. Many people want to find the graveyards of elephants. There is a strong belief that such graveyards exist. Here is why. Bones and tusks of dead elephants have almost never been found. Searches have been made in forests. Grassy plains have been searched too. But neither bones nor tusks are found. Elephants don't live forever. Where are their bones? They don't just bury themselves. Here is one belief. When an elephant gets sick or old, it instinctively knows death is near. It leaves the herd. It goes off to a secret graveyard. The place is known only to elephants, and perhaps other animals, but not to humans. Obviously, such a graveyard would be filled with tusks. These were once very valuable. The objective of explorers was to find this \\"gold\\" mine. This graveyard belief may be a truth or a myth. But it is romantic. It would be nice if it were true.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A baby carrier is like a backpack for carrying a baby. Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago. Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, \\"Where can I buy one?\\" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month. When Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things. Now all over the world babies ride in baby carriers, close to their parents, safe and happy. ,.

Before you can begin to overcome a fear of success, you have to understand what success means to you. Even though it may be tough to pinpoint specifically what being successful means to you, doing this will help you understand exactly what it is you’re fearing. Be sure to identify your vision for personal and professional success. Ask yourself, “What does success look and feel like to me? How will I know if I’m successful? What will I do and how will I act when I’m successful?” Write down as your answers to these questions. Include answers that may not seem to relate to success if they pop into your head. For example, if you think “Success looks like luxury,” write that. Be as specific as possible. For example, instead of writing, “If I have a lot of money I’ll know I’m successful,” write something like, “I’ll know I’m successful when I have 10 million in savings.” Sometimes when we are afraid we can recognize the feeling, but not still understand exactly what we’re afraid of. In order to overcome your fear, you have to ask yourself what specifically you are afraid of and where the fear cam from. Once you know what you’re really afraid of, you can work to overcome your fear. Try asking yourself, “Am I fearful of this because someone put it in my head? Or, is it based on past mistakes or failures?” If the fear is truly unfounded, this may help you let go of it. Look over your list of definitions of success. Think about each item on the list and how you feel about it. For instance, if success is winning a football championship, how will you feel if you do win? Write a few words that describe how you feel about each item. For instance, if you wrote “success is graduating,” you might write, “means I’m not a child anymore; makes me nervous about responsibilities.” Pay attention to signs of success that give you negative feelings. For example, if you listed financial security as a sign of success and you noted it makes you think of loneliness, you may want to explore why this is. Being honest with yourself about just how your fear of success is holding you back is one way to overcome it. Take some time to think about specific ways in which your fear of success is limiting your potential and your future success. Write down examples of how you have sabotaged yourself. For instance, you might write, “I procrastinated on my report.” Also, write about what might have happened if you hadn’t let your fear hold you back. For example, you may write something like, “I could have gotten the raise and afford the vacation I want.” Take a moment to thoroughly visualize yourself succeeding. Positive visualizations may help to eliminate your fear. Writing a short statement declaring that you aren’t going to let fear stop you from succeeding and reaching your goals any more is a concrete way to overcome your fear. Doing this can help you improve your self-confidence, as well as remind you that your fear of success doesn’t control your life. Write a sentence or two along the lines of, “I am not a victim of my fear. I am not afraid of success. I will be successful and I will enjoy it.” Read your statement out-loud on a regular basis. For instance, you might read it before work each morning or before a major presentation. You can also read your declaration to an accountability partner who can help keep you focused on your goal. You may be more likely to follow through with things if someone is holding you accountable.","completion":"The article helps you understand and overcome your fear of success by defining what success means to you, finding the roots of your fear, recognizing how it holds you back, and using positive visualization and declarations to build self-confidence and take control of your life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The girl is sleeping. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"We cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Let's discuss why that's the case. By examining the given premise and hypothesis, we can see that they are presenting two different scenarios, which do not directly support or contradict one another. However, they could not both be true at the same time. Premise: A young girl works on homework at a table. This scenario describes a very specific situation in which a young girl is at a table and actively working on her homework. The main focus here is the girl's engagement in the task of completing her homework. Hypothesis: The girl is sleeping. This scenario presents a completely different situation in which the girl is sleeping. This implies that she is not conscious, and, thus, she is not actively doing anything, including her homework. Analyzing the two statements, we can see that the hypothesis does not stem from the premise, meaning that these two scenarios are not related in a cause-and-effect manner. The occurrence of the premise (the girl working on her homework) does not directly lead to the hypothesis (the girl sleeping). Moreover, it's impossible for the girl to be both working on her homework and sleeping at the same time, as these are mutually exclusive states. However, it's important to note there are situations where the premise and the hypothesis can coexist, although not simultaneously. For example, if the scene is considered on a timeline, it is plausible that a girl who was initially working on her homework eventually becomes tired and falls asleep. In this case, it would be understandable that at one point in time, she was working as described in the premise, and at another point in time, she is sleeping as suggested by the hypothesis. In conclusion, given the premise that a young girl is working on her homework at a table, we cannot directly conclude that the hypothesis indicating that she is sleeping is true. The two statements portray separate scenarios and do not establish a cause-and-effect relation. However, it is important to consider the context in which these scenarios appear, as over time, it's possible the girl transitions from working on her homework to sleeping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This topic falls under the category of Science/Tech as it pertains to the fields of astrobiology, planetary sciences, and the geological study of extraterrestrial rocks. Mars meteorites are essentially space rocks that have been ejected from the surface of Mars due to collisions with other celestial bodies such as asteroids. Some of these Martian meteorites, after traveling through space for a certain duration, ultimately land on Earth's surface. The Allen Hills rock, also known as the Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001), was discovered in Antarctica and has since led to debates regarding its peculiar fossil-shapes and whether or not Mars could have supported more favorable conditions in the past than it does today. This particular meteorite has garnered significant attention from scientists and researchers due to its potential implications for the presence of life on Mars in the past. By studying these Martian rocks, researchers aim to gain a deeper understanding of the Red Planet's history and its potential to host living organisms. Furthermore, the exploration of Mars meteorites and the study of astrobiology contribute to our overall knowledge of the origins and the evolution of life in the universe.

His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \\"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\\" Initially, Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: You'll need to get in basic shape before you can start really toning your muscles. If you move directly into intense exercise, you're much more likely to get overwhelmed and quit or even injure yourself. Start building your endurance by getting off the couch and being active in your everyday life. Take the stairs when you have the choice. Stand instead of sit while you use the computer or study. Walk to places that are a mile or less from your location, instead of taking the car. Go for a relaxing walk or jog instead of watching TV. There are lots of ways to get active in your everyday life without even exercising. Burpees look complex but they're actually easy once you get used to the motions and they're one of the best full body workouts that you can do. Start in a standing position, feet apart. Put your hands down on the ground in front of your feet, jump your legs back so that you go into a push-up position, and do a push-up. Now, jump your feet back, then lift your hands above your head and jump straight up as high as you can. Repeat for at least 10 minutes. You can skip either the push-up or the jump, but both really add to the effectiveness of the exercise, so it is not recommended. Planks are one of the more efficient exercises you can do, significantly increasing the strength of your core muscles and legs in much less time than other core exercises. Start by getting into a push-up position. Now, lower your body so that instead of resting your weight on your hands, your whole forearm is resting on the ground instead. Just hold that position, with your back and legs as straight as possible, for as long as you can. You should try to hold this position for as long as you can, but you should know that holding it for a minute or more takes very strong core muscles. Start out holding the position for 10 seconds, resting for 30 seconds, and then repeating for about 10 minutes. Slowly work your way up to holding the position for 30 seconds to a minute. Squats work your core muscles and your legs, and can even work your arms if you lift small weights while you do them. A squat is done by standing with your feet about a shoulder's width apart and then crouching down, as if you're sitting in an invisible chair. Keep your back straight in order to do this exercise correctly. If you're new to squats, using a chair or table to balance can make it much easier. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is that in order to tone muscles effectively, it's essential to first build a basic level of fitness and endurance through integrating physical activity into daily life. Activities like taking stairs, standing, and walking can help achieve this. Once prepared, exercises such as burpees, planks, and squats can be incorporated to provide full-body workouts, build core strength, and improve fitness. These exercises are versatile and scalable to different fitness levels. Starting with shorter durations and fewer repetitions, individuals can progress gradually to build muscle strength and avoid injuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world. Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January? Hint: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.

As mentioned in the hint, the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight and experiences warmer temperatures during May, June, and July because it faces the Sun during these months. Conversely, in November, December, and January, the Northern Hemisphere faces away from the Sun, leading to colder temperatures. The Earth's axial tilt causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, increasing the solar flux.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who said Beat It was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece? is inside the article: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona., can you guess it ?

Article: A woman was walking her dog along a beach in New Zealand in late June when she saw something that looked like a white ball in the sand. It turned out to be a young Emperor penguin that was lost. At his age, he should have been close to Antarctic, swimming for fish and playing on the ice floes . But this penguin started swimming north and just kept going. The penguin attracted a lot of attention in New Zealand. It has been 40 years since an Emperor penguin was last seen there. Researchers at the Department of Conservation were called in. They decided to watch the penguin closely, but not to disturb it in any way. Many New Zealanders came to Peka Peka Beach to look at the elegant penguin. They were careful to keep their dogs away from it so it wouldn't be frightened. The public nicknamed the animal Happy Feet. Researchers started to notice that Happy Feet didn't seem well. It turns out that he had been eating the sand from the beach, likely thinking it was snow. The public raised more than 11,000 pounds for an operation to get the sand out of his stomach. The operation was a success, and Happy Feet was taken to a zoo in Wellington, NZ. A group of experts met to decide how to help Happy Feet return to the wild. Last Sunday, they put him on a boat called the Tangaroa, in a specially built ice-filled box and took him out into the Southern Ocean, southeast of New Zealand. There, they released him into the ocean, which is his natural habitat. He took one last look at his human helpers and then dived into the ocean. \\"Emperor penguins spend their first five years at sea,\\" said Peter Simpson of New Zealand's Department of Conservation. \\" What happens now is up to the penguin.\\" Happy Feet was fitted with a satellite transmitter so they can monitor his progress using the Internet.

Answer: An invoice or bill is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer , indicating the products , quantities, and agreed prices for products or services the seller has provided the buyer. Question: what is the use of a sales invoice? Answer:","completion":"Yes, your answer is correct. An invoice or sales invoice serves this precise goal. To offer a more exhaustive definition, an invoice, also known as a sales invoice, is a commercial document issued by the seller to the buyer. It records the transaction between the seller and the buyer and provides a detailed list of the goods or services that the buyer has purchased from the seller. One of the critical elements of an invoice includes the products bought by the buyer with their quantities. By enumerating the quantities of the purchased items, the invoice aims to avoid any potential ambiguities and discrepancies between the seller and the buyer. The quantities enable the buyer to keep track of what they have ordered and to confirm whether they have received the correct amount of products from the seller. Aside from the products and quantities, an invoice also specifies the agreed prices for the goods or services. This important aspect provides transparency in terms of how much the buyer is expected to pay for each item. It allows the buyer to understand the total cost of all the goods or services purchased, with a breakdown of the price for each item. The agreed prices also enable the seller to ensure they receive the correct payment for the products or services they have provided. Involving more than recording the products, quantities, and agreed prices, an invoice serves several other crucial purposes. It acts as a legal proof of the transaction between the seller and the buyer, and can be used for audit and tax purposes. It can help both parties keep track of their inventory and financial records. It also helps the seller in managing their accounts receivable, i.e., the money that the buyer owes the seller for the products or services provided. In summary, the main use of a sales invoice is to document the details of the sale, such as the products, quantities, and agreed prices. It comes into play in various processes such as managing inventory, tracking financial transactions, and ensuring compliance with tax and auditing regulations. The invoice is thus an essential tool in business, ensuring both the seller and buyer understand exactly what products or services have been exchanged and the amount due."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, the Speaker remains strictly non-partisan, and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office. The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison's rule). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and remains a constituency Member of Parliament (MP). The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the Palace of Westminster.

See a dermatologist if pore problems persist. Article:","completion":"Title: Tips for a Clean and Healthy Face for Kids It's important to keep our face clean and healthy. There are some easy tips that can help us take care of our skin. Let's learn how to do it. 1. Wash your nose and face daily Our face and nose can get dirty throughout the day. When we play outside or touch things, germs and dirt can get on our skin. To keep it clean, we should wash our face every day with water and gentle soap. This helps remove any dirt or germs that might be on our skin. 2. Don't sleep with makeup on (for those who wear it) Sometimes, people like to wear makeup to look pretty or fancy. However, when it's bedtime, it's important to remove the makeup from our face. This is because makeup can clog our pores (tiny holes in our skin) and make it hard for our skin to breathe. When our pores get blocked, it can cause pimples and unhealthy skin. 3. Wear sunscreen Sunscreen helps protect our skin from the sun when we're playing outside. The sun can be fun, but it can also harm our skin if we're not careful. By wearing sunscreen, we can keep our skin safe from the sun's harmful rays and avoid sunburns. 4. Visit a dermatologist if needed Sometimes, we might have problems with the skin on our face, like big pores or pimples that just won't go away. A dermatologist is a special doctor who knows everything about skin. If we have a problem with our skin, it's important to tell our parents so that they can take us to see a dermatologist. The doctor can help us understand what's happening with our skin and give us advice on how to keep it healthy. In summary, it's essential to wash our face regularly, avoid sleeping with makeup on, wear sunscreen to protect from the sun, and visit a dermatologist if we have any skin problems.

Translate to English","completion":"Having the capacity to gather the necessary information for the protection of civilians, coupled with the collection of information on protection-related incidents in countries of concern to the Council, will be essential for accurately targeting protection and ensuring its place in the Council's deliberations and activities. In order to effectively provide protection to civilians in conflict-affected countries, it is crucial for organizations and authorities involved in safeguarding their safety and well-being to have access to accurate and up-to-date information. This includes understanding the specific threats and risks that civilians face and being able to identify potential areas of concern. By gathering relevant information on incidents affecting the protection of civilians, the Council and other stakeholders can make informed decisions about where to focus their efforts and allocate resources. One of the key components of this information-gathering process involves monitoring developments in countries that are of particular concern to the Council due to ongoing conflicts, human rights abuses, or other factors that may put civilians in danger. This enables the Council to assess the effectiveness of current protection measures and adapt its approach as necessary to better address emerging threats and challenges. In addition to collecting information on specific incidents, it is also important to track broader trends and patterns in the protection of civilians in order to identify any potential issues that may need further attention from the Council. This can include examining the root causes of conflicts, the underlying factors that contribute to the vulnerability of civilians, and the barriers that may hinder the implementation of effective protection strategies. By taking a comprehensive approach to the gathering and analysis of information, the Council can better understand the complex dynamics at play in conflict-affected countries and develop more targeted and effective responses to protect civilians at risk. In summary, having the capacity to gather the necessary information for the protection of civilians, as well as monitoring protection-related incidents in countries of concern to the Council, allows for a more informed decision-making process and enables the development of targeted and effective protection strategies. By incorporating this information into their deliberations and activities, the Council can enhance its ability to safeguard civilians in conflict-affected countries and contribute to the overall goal of promoting peace, security, and human rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how a silencer works Suggestion: Several firearms with detachable suppressors, from top to bottom: An Uzi , An AR-15 , A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical, A Beretta 92FS , and a SIG Mosquito . The answer is:","completion":"False. The proposed suggestion does not provide a correct answer to the given question. The question \\"how a silencer works\\" requires an explanation of the mechanism or process by which a silencer, also known as a suppressor, reduces the noise produced by a firearm. The proposal, however, only provides examples of firearms that can have detachable suppressors attached to them. This is a simple description of firearms, rather than an explanation of how the silencer on such a firearm works. For completeness, here is a brief explanation of how a silencer works: A silencer or a suppressor is attached to the barrel of a firearm to suppress the amount of noise and visible muzzle flash produced upon shooting. When a gun is fired, it releases hot, high-pressure gases from the barrel, which is the cause of the loud gunshot noise. The main role of a silencer is to provide a larger space for these gases to expand and cool before they are released into the air, thereby reducing the noise level. It achieves this through a series of compartments or baffles that divert the gases and slow their release. The suppressor also helps to conceal the muzzle flash since it traps the gases that would ordinarily get lit by the spark of the firing mechanism and become visible. To be effective, the suppressor must be designed to withstand the pressure and heat from the gas, and to let the bullet travel through it, unimpeded, on its way to the target. The list of firearms given as a suggestion - An Uzi , An AR-15 , A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical, A Beretta 92FS , and a SIG Mosquito - can indeed be fitted with silencers, but without an explanation of how these silencers work, the suggestion does not answer the question correctly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).

To answer this task, you need to analyze the given input and classify your answer into either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". In the given example: Input: Head: PersonX babysits PersonX's nephew<sep>Tail: to be old enough 1. Read and understand the Head and Tail phrases: PersonX is babysitting their nephew, and the Tail phrase talks about the desire to be old enough. 2. Analyze if the Head event would lead to PersonY or others wanting what's mentioned in the Tail: In this case, the Head event doesn't relate to anyone wanting to be old enough. 3. Classify your answer: Since the Head and Tail events are not connected in this example, the answer is \\"No\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This is just about the only useful thing about this book.This book is just as awful as every other title written by Mr. Mortier.The really bad part is that someone at Charles River Media seems to think Mr. Mortier's books are worth publishing. Because of the pitiful nature of every one of this author's titles I've seen to date I am now very reluctant to purchase any Charles River published book. It's sad that a company with so many excellent titles would continue to publish such poor quality books by the same author.If you're expecting anything along the lines of something that would be written by Tim Albee, Patrik Beck, or Dan Ablan you will be sadly disappointed. If you were looking for in-depth coverage of modeling in Lightwave keep looking, it's not in here. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the book's quality and the author's writing style. They compare the book to the author's other works, all of which they find to be \\"pitiful\\" and \\"poor quality.\\" Additionally, they criticize the publishing company, Charles River Media, for continuing to publish books by this author and mention that it has made them reluctant to purchase any other titles from the company. The only positive aspect mentioned in the review is that the book may be considered useful for aspiring authors as it demonstrates that anyone can get published, no matter the quality of their work. However, this point is still made with a negative undertone, as it highlights the reviewer's perception that the book's content is poorly written. In conclusion, the overall tone of this product review is negative, as the majority of the comments criticize the book's quality, the author's writing ability, and the publishing company's decision to continue publishing the author's works.

Help as much as you can. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\"? Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

It is with great disappointment that I must now share my negative experience at this establishment, hoping that potential visitors may arrive with tempered expectations, and the management considers changes for the better. Aesthetics: Upon arriving, I couldn't help but notice the dull and lackluster exterior of the building. Contrary to the glowing descriptions and images from my online research, the outside failed to make a compelling first impression. The inside did marginally better, adorned with a few pieces of quirky artwork that seemed to aim at compensating for the otherwise bland decor. The lighting felt harsh and excessive, making it less welcoming and slightly off-putting. Service Quality: As a patron who greatly values genuine hospitality and timely service, this establishment severely under-delivered. The staff appeared to be overwhelmed and disorganized, as I witnessed multiple instances of unattended customers languishing at their tables. My own experience was no different. After what felt like an eternity, our orders were taken reluctantly and with evident confusion. Instead of the customary courtesy and attentiveness, we were met with coldness and a rushed demeanor from the waitstaff. Food and Beverage Quality: Sadly, this was the most disappointing aspect of my visit. The menu offered what appeared to be a diverse selection of dishes, yet it seemed that corners had been cut in terms of ingredient quality and preparation. My appetizer arrived lukewarm and under-seasoned, hinting at a potentially careless approach in the kitchen. My main course was both overcooked and in dire need of flavor, presenting inconsistencies with what was advertised within the menu. As for the beverages, I found the cocktail I ordered lackluster in presentation and taste. It seemed as if the bartender was skimping on the ingredients, resulting in a diluted and uninspiring concoction not worth the price. Cleanliness and Hygiene: Throughout my visit, I could not ignore the general untidiness of the place. Dining tables were not promptly cleared, fostering an environment that felt less than sanitary. The restrooms were in rough shape, with no attention being paid to basic cleanliness and supplies. Value for Money: Considering the disappointing quality of the food, beverages, service, and atmosphere, this establishment's pricing fell far from matching the experience provided. Exorbitant prices for mediocre offerings made for a displeasing and unjustifiable cost/value relationship. In conclusion, my visit to this place left me profoundly disheartened. The significant disparity between expectations and reality made for a regrettable experience. I sincerely hope that future visitors manage their expectations and that the proprietors take this feedback as an opportunity to improve and deliver what was once promised - a vibrant, welcoming establishment with quality offerings and service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The young man is sitting and watching tv. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Possible answers: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no;","completion":"The answer to this question is \\"no\\". Based on the information provided, it's clear that these two scenarios are entirely different. In the first instance, the young man is actively involved in a physical game that requires movement, precision, and spatial awareness: pool or billiards. This recreational activity is often played in a social setting and requires the player's active, physical engagement. The individual needs to maneuver around the table, aiming and striking the pool balls with a cue stick according to the game rules. On the other hand, watching TV is a passive activity, where the individual is typically stationary, and demands far less physical engagement. Someone sitting and watching TV is usually merely receiving entertainment without the need for active physical contribution. So, if the premise is the young man shooting pool, it's not possible that simultaneously, the hypothesis can be true – that he is sitting and watching TV. Unless clarified that he is doing both activities at different moments, based off the information given, the two cannot be true at the same time due to the contrasting levels of activity and engagement they entail. Moreover, we do not have enough information to argue that he is multitasking or switching between the two activities. For instance, we do not know if he is watching a TV program while taking breaks in between shots or if there’s a television playing in the background at the bar or pool hall where he’s playing. Thus, we can't conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true based solely on the information given. The activities described—shooting pool and watching television—are distinct and feature contrasting levels of engagement. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot say that the young man is doing both simultaneously. The conclusion of this scenario is that the hypothesis is false when considering the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

And the answer is?","completion":"The name of the group formed by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in 1957 was called \\"Tom & Jerry.\\" Here is a detailed history of the duo and their collaboration: Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel first met in elementary school in Queens, New York, back in the early 1950s. They became friends and bonded over their shared love for music. Both were influenced by the rock and roll and doo-wop sounds that were popular during their youth. The two friends began to perform together in various school productions. As their musical partnership evolved, they started writing their own songs and formed a duo called \\"Tom & Jerry\\" in 1957. At this point, they were only teenagers – Simon was 16 years old, and Garfunkel was 15. Paul Simon took the stage name \\"Jerry Landis,\\" inspired by the first name of his girlfriend, Sue Landis, at that time, while Arthur Garfunkel adopted the pseudonym \\"Tom Graph,\\" referencing his love for mathematics and the fact that he used to track the progress of hit songs on graph paper. In 1957, the duo wrote and recorded their first single, \\"Hey Schoolgirl,\\" which was inspired by the music of their idols, The Everly Brothers. The song managed to capture the attention of Sid Prosen, the owner of an independent record label called Big Records. Prosen believed in the talent of the young duo and offered them a recording contract. Under Prosen's guidance, they released \\"Hey Schoolgirl,\\" which rapidly gained popularity and managed to reach number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The commercial success of their first single led to appearances on popular television programs, such as \\"American Bandstand\\" and \\"The Alan Freed Show.\\" However, the duo's success as Tom & Jerry was short-lived as they failed to achieve the same level of commercial success with their following singles. Their relationship with Prosen soured, and the duo decided to disband in order to pursue their individual careers and focus on their college education. While attending separate colleges, Simon and Garfunkel continued to write songs and performed occasionally. In the early 1960s, folk music experienced a revival, and the duo rekindled their partnership with a new musical direction. Eventually, they abandoned their stage names and began performing under their real names, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. In 1964, they released their debut album as a folk duo named \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\\" The album included their iconic song \\"The Sound of Silence,\\" which became a massive hit after it was remixed and re-released in 1965. From that point on, Simon & Garfunkel achieved widespread fame and recognition for their intricate vocal harmonies, poetic lyrics, and evocative melodies. They went on to release a series of successful albums that solidified their place in music history, with hits like \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" and \\"Scarborough Fair.\\" Though Tom & Jerry didn't last long, the partnership between Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel left an undeniable mark on the musical landscape, ultimately becoming one of the most successful and critically acclaimed duos in popular music history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose \\"the star doesnt have enough mass\\" happens, how will it affect star is smaller in size. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of the star not having enough mass could lead to the star being smaller in size. When a star doesn't have enough mass, it cannot go through all the transformations that a more massive star would undergo. This means it does not expand to the same extent and so remains relatively small. The second effect mentioned is the star undergoing a change in its core and bonding helium to carbon and oxygen. This transformation is heavily dependent on the star's mass. If the star doesn't have enough mass, the core will not reach high enough temperatures or pressures to catalyze and sustain these fusion reactions. Given these considerations, the perturbation of the star not having enough mass does influence the second effect mentioned by lessening it. Without enough mass, the transformation in the core that bonds helium to carbon and oxygen will be less effective or might not occur at all.

The","completion":"decision came after a heated and closely-watched legal battle between Bristol and Johnston, with both parties providing evidence to support their claims for the child's custody. Bristol, supported by her mother Sarah Palin, argued that she had been the primary caregiver for Tripp since his birth and had provided a stable and nurturing environment for him, while Johnston's history of inconsistency, lack of responsibility, and brushes with the legal system made him an unfit parent. Levi Johnston, on the other hand, maintained that he had made significant strides in improving his life and was now more than capable of sharing equal custody of Tripp. He submitted proof of steady employment, completion of parenting classes, and a consistent effort to be involved in his son's life. However, his claims were heavily scrutinized by the court due to previous incidents involving substance abuse, confrontations with the Palins, and alleged neglect of his other children from a different relationship. During the trial, Tripp's well-being and best interests were at the center of the arguments. Mental health professionals, child welfare experts, and teachers testified on behalf of both parents, offering insight into Tripp's progress under Bristol's care and the potential impact of shared custody on his development. The focus of the trial remained on ensuring a stable and healthy environment for Tripp regardless of the political and media implications surrounding the high-profile court case. While the court's decision to favor Bristol might seem politically biased given the judge's history with Sarah Palin, Judge Gregory Heath emphasized throughout the trial that his decision would be based solely on the best interests of the child. In his ruling, the judge explained that Bristol had shown a higher level of commitment to the child's welfare, consistently providing a stable home environment and prioritizing the child's needs above her own. The judge also cited concerns about Levi Johnston's history and his ability to consistently provide a conducive environment for the child's growth. Despite the denial of Levi Johnston's petition for equal custody, the court recognized his genuine efforts to be a responsible and involved father. The judge granted him increased visitation rights and scheduled periodic review hearings to determine whether any future changes to the custody arrangement should be made. The hope was that both parents would continue to work together, putting their differences aside to create a positive co-parenting environment for Tripp. As the dust began to settle following the high-profile trial, both Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston received widespread media attention for their roles in the custody battle. While several media outlets criticized the court's decision as inherently biased and politically motivated, others praised Bristol and the court for putting the well-being of the child first. Throughout the ordeal, the Palin family remained staunchly supportive of Bristol, even issuing a public statement calling on all involved parties to prioritize Tripp's best interests above all else. In the end, the most logical completion of this news story is one that highlights the importance of prioritizing a child's well-being in custody disputes, even in highly publicized cases like this one. The court's decision to keep Tripp with his primary caregiver and to grant Levi Johnston increased visitation rights represents a noble effort to ensure the best possible outcome for the child, despite the political undertones surrounding the case. The hope now is that both Bristol and Levi will accept the court's ruling and move forward with the child's best interests as their guiding principle, working collaboratively for the betterment of their son's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. The narrator believes that - Chocolate is a good dish - Colomba is a good dish - not enough information - Panettone is a bad dish A:","completion":"The narrator believes that \\"Colomba is a good dish\\". This deduction comes from the detailed description given about the columba, citing the sugared almond topping, the soft and fluffy texture, as well as highlighting the process of its making. The narrator never mentions any disliking or negative aspects towards the colomba, indicating a favorable opinion of it. There is nothing mentioned about their opinion of chocolate, nor is there a definitive evaluation of the panettone; their previous attempts to make it were marked as \\"absolutely delicious,\\" albeit not perfectly executed.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: April 2-May 2 is the worst 30 day period for me. The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story. Question: When did his wife died?

We don't charge these companies for advertisements nor accept any contributions or gifts from them. Please enjoy the emotional ride of modern advertisement . ||||| That famous John Wanamaker quote about half of advertising spending being wasted may not apply to the Super Bowl : A study by research firm Communicus suggests 80% of the ads don't sell stuff. Indeed, the 4 million advertisers spend for a 30-second Big Game ad actually buys a much bigger chance that their ads won't work, according to the Tucson, Ariz.-based firm. In general, Communicus has found about 60% of ads it tests don't increase purchase or purchase intent. Tide's 2013 'Miracle Stain' ad, which was well liked and did well on branding, still didn't increase purchases or intent. The firm reached its Super Bowl conclusions through interviews with more than 1,000 consumers before and after they were exposed to the ads in the 2012 and 2013 games. Before the game, Communicus asks people what they've bought recently and what they intend to buy in the categories spanning the Super Bowl advertiser base. Then it follows up with the same group within the next couple of weeks and asks similar questions as well as others in order to gauge whether consumers actually saw Super Bowl ads for various brands. For categories with longer purchase cycles, such as automobiles, Communicus uses other measures such as changes in intention to investigate buying a brand. CEO Jeri Smith said it takes its first read on a typical ad four weeks after it starts running to allow for multiple exposures. She said one thing that she suspects hurts Super Bowl ads is that many of them don't air regularly after the game and \\"we find that one ad exposure often isn't enough to make anything happen.\\" She believes there are other factors at play, too. \\"The advertisers really dial up the entertainment quotient to pop to the top of the USA Today rankings and such,\\" she said. \\"But we find the brand association with Super Bowl commercials is much lower than you'd get with a typical buy, just because of the way the creative is structured.\\" Super Bowl ads actually do better than average in ad awareness, with 44% of people remembering they've seen an average Super Bowl ad vs. 32% for other ads that get similar gross-rating-point exposure, Ms. Smith said. But because the creative often focuses less on the brands, she said, people not surprisingly remember the brands less often in Super Bowl ads. People who remember seeing a Super Bowl ad recall the brand 35% of the time vs. about half the time for other ads, she said. The Super Bowl works better for new products, Ms. Smith said, because the ad message tends to be clearer. Yet, some brands without any real news have fared well too. Budweiser's \\"Brotherhood\\" ad from the 2013 game, showing the relationship between a Clydesdale and its trainer, fared well in terms of entertainment value and increasing purchase intent, she said, because the iconic horse is so well linked to the brand and the creative was compelling. \\"Beer is an affinity product,\\" she said. \\"I want a beer that makes me feel good about myself.\\" But Tide's 2013 \\"Miracle Stain\\" ad, which was well liked and did well on branding, still didn't increase purchases or intent, according to Ms. Smith. \\"It didn't tell people anything they didn't already know,\\" she said. \\"And unlike Budweiser, I don't buy Tide because of my personal connection.\\" Long-form commercials such as Tide's 60-second spot \\"run the risk of people being so caught up in the story that they forget about the brand,\\" Ms. Smith said. And in \\"Miracle Stain,\\" the brand appeared at the end as \\"kind of the anti-hero\\" by eliminating a stain that looked like former San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Joe Montana. Meanwhile, last year's Mercedes spot did well because it drove home the message that the brand had a more affordable model coming and helped boost interest in the brand more broadly. But most of the automotive commercials \\"go to the bottom of the list in terms of effectiveness because they all run together in people's minds,\\" she said. Communicus uses some of the same purchase-comparison metrics copy pre-testing firms use, but gauges the ads' effect on consumers who've seen them (or not seen them) in the real world rather than through forced viewing. Asking about purchase intent is not precise as sales data but is superior in isolating the impact of the advertising with the individuals involved, since they're going back pre- and post with the same individuals and the only real variable is whether they saw the ad (given that both groups are just as likely to have been influenced by promotions or other factors). ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Advertiser demand for next year's Super Bowl XLVIII commercial time is high, with 30-second spots selling for up to 4 million.

Article: American teenager Thomas Cheatham had planned to study Latin during his sophomore year at Hebron High School in Texas. But when he learned that the school district was going to offer a Mandarin class, he quickly changed his mind. \\"I thought it (Mandarin) would be more beneficial than Latin,\\" said Cheatham, who is now in his second year of studying the language. He speaks Mandarin to order food at Chinese restaurants and can read Face book posts from his Chinese-speaking friends. While it'a difficult language to master, the high school junior, who plans to study computer engineering, thinks it will be a valuable thing in his career. \\"Chinese is a good language to know, especially with China becoming a growing power,\\" he said. Many experts agree that proficiency in a language spoken by a billion people worldwide will give American students an edge in the global economy. \\"People are looking at China as our next economic competitor, and interest in Mandarin is growing,'' said Marty Abbott, executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. ''We're seeing it in all parts of the country.\\" The number of students studying Mandarin in public schools nationwide in grades 7 through 12 grew from 20,000 in 2004-2005 to 60,000 three years later, according to the council's most recent survey. Abbott estimates that as many as 100,000 students are now studying Mandarin, in public and private schools, throughout the nation. She said the US government has considered Mandarin to be an \\"important needs\\" language and provides professional development programs for teachers. \\"Our government wants to increase our language ability for national security and economic competitiveness,\\" Abbott said.

Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically...

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) I am facing a new situation today: John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fork would have lower frequency of the vibrations, fork A or fork B? The answer is:","completion":"Fork B would have the lower frequency of vibrations. Step 1: Understand the information given in the background article. - Frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. - Higher-frequency waves require more energy and have more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. Step 2: Analyze the new situation. - John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. - Fork A has a higher frequency, and fork B has a lower frequency. - Both frequencies have the same amplitude. Step 3: Using the knowledge from the background article, answer the question. - Since fork A has a higher frequency and fork B has a lower frequency, with both having the same amplitude, it confirms that fork B has a lower frequency of vibrations as compared to fork A."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: The Spy Who Loved Me is the ninth novel in the James Bond series authored by Ian Fleming, who was educated at Eton, Sandhurst, Munich, and what other university?

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm? Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Willson was born in Mason City, Iowa, to John David Willson and Rosalie Reiniger Willson, and he had a brother two years his senior, John Cedrick, and a sister 12 years his senior, the children's author Dixie Willson. He attended Frank Damrosch's Institute of Musical Art (which later became the Juilliard School) in New York City. He married his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth \\"Peggy\\" Wilson, on August 29, 1920. A flute and piccolo player, Willson was a member of John Philip Sousa's band (1921-1923), and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini (1924-1929). Context: His work in films included composing the score for Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) (Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score), and arranging music for the score of William Wyler's The Little Foxes (1941) (Academy Award nomination for Best Music Score of a Dramatic Picture). During World War II, he worked for the United States' Armed Forces Radio Service. His work with the AFRS teamed him with George Burns, Gracie Allen and Bill Goodwin. He would work with all three as the bandleader, and a regular character, on the Burns and Allen radio program. He played a shy man, always trying to get advice on women. His character was ditsy as well, basically a male version of Gracie Allen's character. In 1942, Willson had his own program on NBC. Meredith Willson's Music was a summer replacement for Fibber McGee and Molly. Sparkle Time, which ran on CBS in 1946-47, was Willson's first full-season radio program. Returning to network radio after WWII, he created the Talking People, a choral group that spoke in unison while delivering radio commercials. He also became the musical director for The Big Show, a prestigious comedy-variety program hosted by actress Tallulah Bankhead and featuring some of the world's most respected entertainers. Willson himself became part of one of the show's very few running gags, beginning replies to Bankhead's comments or questions with \\"well, sir, Miss Bankhead . . .\\" Willson wrote the song \\"May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You\\" for the show. Bankhead spoke the lyrics over the music at the end of each show. He also worked on Jack Benny's radio program, and hosted his own program in 1949. For a few years in the early 1950s, Willson was a regular panelist on the Goodson-Todman game show The Name's the Same. In 1950 Willson served as Musical Director for The California Story, the Golden State's centennial production at the Hollywood Bowl. Through working on this production, Willson met writer Franklin Lacey who proved instrumental in developing the story line for a musical Willson had been working on, soon to be known as The Music Man. The California Story spectacular was followed by two more state centennial collaborations with stage director Vladimir Rosing: The Oregon Story in 1959 and The Kansas Story in 1961. Question: What happened on this program?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Alright, little buddy, let me explain it to you! So, Meredith Willson was a very talented musician and he worked on many programs on the radio.

Short movie review: dopey Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic is thinking negatively about the movie. \\"Dopey\\" is a term that commonly refers to something being silly or ridiculous, oftentimes with an insinuation of a lack of intelligence or thoughtfulness. Generally, it's a term more often used with a negative connotation. When a critic uses such a term to describe a movie, it likely means they found the content of the movie to be lacking in depth, sophistication, or seriousness, even if it wasn't necessarily meant to be a serious film. It could indicate that they found the humor or storyline to be juvenile, overly simple, or not as refined or well-crafted as they'd prefer. They may have found that the plot was too predictable or that the acting performances were not well executed. They could have also found the script to be uninspiring or filled with cliches. Overall, they probably didn't feel the film was memorable or impactful in a positive way. However, it's also worth noting that not every viewer or critic has the same taste in films, and just because one person labels a movie negatively doesn't mean everyone else will feel the same way. Some people might enjoy a more relaxed, \\"dopey\\" film that's easy to follow along without needing to think too deeply about complex themes or plots. So while this critic had a negative viewpoint, other viewers might actually find the movie to be fun and entertaining. It's also possible that if the film was meant to be a comedy, or specifically a silly or slapstick comedy, some success could be found in its dopey nature. The right audience might appreciate it for what it is, rather than expecting it to be something it's not.

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years.

Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

This discrepancy can be attributed to the nature of the two websites: while Google serves as a search engine and provides various tools that are primarily focused on utility and efficiency, Facebook is a social media platform designed to encourage engagement and interaction among users. As a result, it is not surprising that users would spend more time interacting with friends, family, and acquaintances on Facebook, as well as consuming content shared by others and engaging with various features such as groups, pages, and events. In contrast, Google users are more likely to visit the site with a specific purpose in mind (e.g., finding information, using a particular tool or service), and once that purpose is achieved, they move on to other activities. This difference in user behavior underscores the importance of understanding the unique characteristics and strengths of each platform when developing a digital marketing strategy or considering where to allocate resources and efforts. In particular, businesses and organizations should take into account the intended purpose and target audience of each platform in order to maximize their online presence and effectiveness.

Social commentary mingles with stupid comedy in this humorless update of a 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda romp.","completion":"While it is not possible for me to accurately pinpoint the exact movie based on this brief and vague review, I can give you an educated guess based on the provided information. The mention of a 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda romp suggests the original film was \\"Fun with Dick and Jane.\\" This means the review seems likely to be about the remake of \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" (2005), which starred Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni in the roles originally portrayed by Segal and Fonda. The 2005 \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" is a dark comedy directed by Dean Parisot, and it focuses on a privileged suburban couple who turn to a life of crime after financial misfortune strikes due to the husband's company going bankrupt. Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) works for Globodyne, a massive corporation where he is quickly promoted just before the company's stock collapses, leaving the couple penniless. The couple then takes on various schemes and criminal activities to maintain their lifestyle and pay for their mounting debts, all while comically showcasing their ineptitude at a life of crime. The review suggests that the film offers social commentary in the form of a satirical take on the corporate greed and the economic downturn this can cause. It highlights how Dick and Jane's privileged lifestyle quickly crumbles as a result of the corporation's bankruptcy, and the desperate measures they take to cope with their new reality. The humor is meant to serve as a critique of the way society reacts to these situations, as well as the superficial nature of attaining success via material wealth. At the same time, the review seems to imply that the humor may come across as \\"stupid comedy,\\" which might mean that the film relies too heavily on slapstick humor or over-the-top antics rather than focusing on intelligent comedy or subtle satire. This may make the movie less enjoyable to some, particularly those who were fans of the 1977 version or prefer more sophisticated humor. Additionally, the phrase \\"humorless update\\" implies the reviewer felt that the film did not live up to expectations from the original or provide enough new elements to make it feel fresh. The movie may be considered a disappointing adaptation that tries too hard to be relevant and fails to capture the magic of the original film. In summary, the film in question is likely the 2005 remake of \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" starring Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni. However, it is important to remember that this evaluation is made on the assumption that the provided review refers to this specific film, and the interpretation of the review may differ among individual viewers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cook County sheriff's officials were notified Monday that Garrett Glover, 29, had been released from Illinois Department of Corrections custody after being sentenced to four years in prison Thursday in a 2014 attempted armed robbery case from Country Club Hills. Glover is awaiting trial in the Sept. 5, 2012, shooting of Larry Porter, 25, near 87th Street on the Dan Ryan. Glover had been in jail since at least February 2014, and when he was sentenced last week was given credit toward his four-year prison term for already serving 879 days in jail, according to court records. He was released on parole Friday, according to Illinois Department of Corrections records. \\"Glover should have been returned to custody of the Cook County Jail on the other case\\" but instead was released, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. \\"The sheriff's office is investigating the circumstances surrounding his release, and all efforts are being made to secure his apprehension.\\" Because the Illinois Department of Corrections was not given \\"documentation indicating Mr. Glover should have been retained or sent back to Cook County custody, the IDOC, by law, had to release him,\\" spokeswoman Nicole Wilson said in a statement. \\"He was appropriately admitted into IDOC custody and because his sentence required that he serve 50 percent of his time, he was released to parole on Feb. 24, 2017,\\" according to the statement. Glover, Patrick Calvin and Tyrone Mixon are awaiting trial in the 2012 Dan Ryan killing, according to court records. Calvin is being held in Cook County Jail, while Mixon is serving a prison term in an unrelated case in Wisconsin, according to records. Porter was driving a black 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee south on the expressway when he was shot by another motorist, police said at the time of his killing. Glover, Calvin and a third man — identified by Illinois State Police as Mixon — shot at Porter from inside a maroon van they had borrowed from a North Side woman Glover knew, prosecutors said when the three were charged. Another man in the Jeep was shot, but the then-27-year-old man in the back seat, later identified as the owner of the Jeep and the target of the shooting, wasn't injured. Anyone with information about where Glover might be is asked to call the Sheriff's Command Center at 773-674-0169.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Create a pickling mixture for any type of vegetable or fruit. Select from: A). Boil vinegar, sugar and spices in a pot and add the vegetable or fruit you want to pickle and boil for a little longer. Let it cool down and then put the vegetable or fruit in a jar and pour the rest of the pots contents over it and store.; B). Boil water, sugar and spices in a pot and add the vegetable or fruit you want to pickle and boil for a little longer. Let it cool down and then put the vegetable or fruit in a jar and pour the rest of the pots contents over it and store.;","completion":"Option A is the better solution for the following goal: Create a pickling mixture for any type of vegetable or fruit. There are several reasons why this solution prevails over Option B. 1. Acidity level: One of the key elements in pickling is the acidity level of the pickling mixture. In pickling mixtures, acidity is essential to preserve the vegetables and fruits and prevent spoilage caused by the growth of unwanted microorganisms. In Option A, vinegar is used as the main acidic component, which provides the necessary acidic environment for proper preservation of the vegetables and fruits. Vinegar typically has an acetic acid content ranging between 4% and 7%, making it suitable for pickling. Option B, on the other hand, utilizes water instead of vinegar, which will not provide the required acidic environment for preservation. 2. Fermentation control: In the pickling process, controlling fermentation is crucial for flavor development and preservation. Vinegar, used in Option A, helps inhibit unwanted fermentation by creating an unfriendly environment for spoilage-causing microorganisms. By preventing uncontrolled fermentation, you can achieve a more consistent and desirable flavor in your pickled vegetables and fruits. In contrast, Option B lacks this advantage due to the absence of vinegar. 3. Flavor enhancement: Vinegar, used in Option A, plays a significant role in enhancing the flavor of the pickled product. The acetic acid in vinegar imparts a tangy, sour taste that is characteristic of pickled products. Additionally, vinegar helps to balance and meld other flavors present in the pickling mixture, such as sugar and spices, resulting in more complex and well-integrated flavors. Using water in Option B will not offer the same flavor benefits. 4. Texture preservation: Vinegar in a pickling mixture helps preserve the texture of vegetables and fruits by inhibiting the enzymatic processes that cause softening and spoilage. As a result, pickled vegetables and fruits using vinegar, as in Option A, will maintain a firmer and crisper texture than those in Option B. Given these reasons, boiling vinegar, sugar, and spices in a pot (Option A) is the better solution for creating a pickling mixture for any type of vegetable or fruit. Option A provides an ideal acidic environment for preservation, helps control fermentation, enhances the flavor, and preserves the texture of the vegetables and fruits being pickled. Option B, using water instead of vinegar, would not provide the same benefits and might result in less successful pickling outcomes."},{"prompt":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help.

Question: Which side finished bottom of the 1st division of the County Cricket Championship in 2008? Answer:","completion":"In 2008, the team that finished at the bottom of the 1st Division of the County Cricket Championship was Surrey County Cricket Club. Surrey struggled throughout the season, facing several challenges on and off the field which eventually led them to the last position in the standings. The 2008 County Championship, the domestic first-class cricket competition in England and Wales, was divided into two divisions: Division One and Division Two. Each division comprised nine teams, and the teams played each other twice during the season – once at their home ground and once at the opposition's ground. Surrey's performance in the 2008 season was far from satisfactory, as they struggled to find any consistency in their game. With only three wins throughout the season, the team managed to obtain a mere 131.5 points, finishing dead last in the 1st division. The poor performance in the County Championship prompted the club to reassess the team dynamics and improve their strategies for the coming seasons. Key factors that contributed to Surrey's poor performance in 2008 include injuries to key players, lack of experienced and solid leadership, and several changes in the coaching staff. The inconsistent form of their key players also played a crucial role in their overall performance. Many players faced inconsistency in their batting and bowling performances, which affected the team's ability to close out matches and, ultimately, win games. It is worth noting that, while 2008 was a dark year for Surrey, it served as a major wake-up call for the team management to make some necessary changes. Following that 2008 season, Surrey started rebuilding their squad and implemented new training strategies to improve the performance of their players. This ultimately led to better performances in the following years and their eventual promotion back to Division One. In conclusion, Surrey County Cricket Club finished bottom of the 1st division of the County Cricket Championship in 2008, with a total of 131.5 points. The team's performance during the season was heavily impacted by injuries, lack of leadership, and inconsistency in key players' game. However, the disappointment of this season was a turning point for the club, paving the way for new strategies and a stronger squad in the subsequent years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When a plant wilts, the stomata close. How does this help the plant?","completion":"To answer the question, I will provide information on the function of stomata and the significance of their closure when a plant wilts. Step 1: Understanding the function of stomata Stomata are small pores found on the surface of plant leaves, which primarily serve to regulate gas exchange between the plant and its environment. They allow the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) needed for photosynthesis while also facilitating the release of oxygen (O2) and excess water vapor through a process called transpiration. Step 2: Explaining the wilting of a plant Wilting occurs when a plant loses more water than it absorbs, leading to a decrease in turgor pressure within its cells. This decrease in turgor pressure causes the plant to lose structural support and droop. Wilting is often a response to environmental factors such as drought, heat, or insufficient water absorption through the roots. Step 3: Describing the closure of stomata when a plant wilts In response to water stress, plants have evolved mechanisms to conserve water, such as closing their stomata. When stomata close, it reduces the rate of transpiration, limiting the amount of water vapor that exits the leaf. This is an essential response to help the plant retain moisture and prevent further water loss. Step 4: Concluding the importance of stomatal closure during wilting To answer the question, when a plant wilts, the stomata close to help the plant conserve water and reduce further water loss. By limiting transpiration, the plant can retain moisture, allowing it to better withstand periods of drought, heat, or inadequate water supply. This physiological response helps to increase the plant's chances of survival during times of water stress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Over time, you'll see the sun's warmth turn the water into tiny misty droplets. This is evaporation! 6. Those misty droplets start collecting at the top part of the bag or the container. Later, you may find some little water droplets forming again, which is also part of the water cycle called \\"condensation.\\" Remember, this may take some time, so be patient and excited to see water evaporate and the water cycle happening right in front of you!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer's complaints about Safeway's layout, high shelves, and early closing hours, as well as his mention of being turned away when trying to buy wine, reflect his dissatisfaction. He also makes light of the cashier's offer for help, suggesting that he finds it unnecessary or even possibly condescending. These views point toward an overall negative sentiment towards Safeway. The option of 'positive' is incorrect because the review has more critical comments than positive remarks. Even though the customer made a positive comment on the wine from Circle K, it was not referenced to Safeway therefore it does not count as a positive sentiment towards it."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: M: Hello, I saw your advertisement in the newspaper.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own active immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life. As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory of the mother to the pathogens to which she has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory. Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade.

Summarize this article: Two female Democrats walked out of a House oversight committee hearing on the contraceptive coverage rule Thursday morning, accusing Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) of manipulating committee rules to block female witnesses from testifying. \\"What I want to know is, where are the women?\\" asked Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) before walking out. \\"I look at this panel [of witnesses], and I don't see one single individual representing the tens of millions of women across the country who want and need insurance coverage for basic preventive health care services, including family planning.\\" Text Size - + reset Female Democrats on why they walked out of hearing The five witnesses on the first panel were all male religious leaders or professors, including a Catholic bishop. Two women were listed on the committee website as witnesses for a second, later panel, also dominated by conservatives. The first panel, however, tends to draw the most attention at hearings. Democrats withdrew the name of a witness Issa had accepted, Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, because they wanted a woman to testify. Lynn submitted a written statement instead. Maloney pressed Issa to allow Sandra Fluke, a law student from Georgetown University, to testify about the impact of the new requirement that most health plans offer contraceptive coverage with no co-pay. Issa shot back that Fluke was rejected because she was \\"not found to be appropriate or qualified\\" to testify about religious liberty. He said liberty, not contraception, was the topic of the hearing. Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle (R-N.Y.), the only female Republican lawmaker at the hearing, agreed with Issa. \\"I really find it so objectionable that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would characterize this as something so narrow as being about contraception,\\" she said. \\"This is a fundamental assault on one’s conscience.\\" Ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (D-M.D.) also accused the Republican majority of silencing women in the discussion even though they are most affected by the policy. \\"This committee commits a massive injustice by trying to pretend that the views of millions of women across this country are meaningless, or worthless, or irrelevant to this debate,” he said. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) attempted to force a vote on seating Fluke, saying the chairman was breaking committee rules. When he ignored her motion, Norton and Maloney walked out. Maloney later returned. Norton did not. Norton accused Issa of \\"pretzel turning of the rules so as to deny us a witness\\" in a press conference convened in the hallway. She said the hearing was \\"the kind you expect in an autocratic regime.\\" Fluke told the gathered reporters about a friend’s experience that she had hoped to include in her testimony. The woman had lost an ovary to an illness that could have been treated with contraceptives that she couldn't access and now was facing the possibility of infertility, Fluke said. \\"It's striking that the chairman would say that the reason I cannot speak is that I'm not qualified to speak on the matter,\\" she said. \\"I feel that the women this affects are the most qualified to speak on this matter.\\" ||||| ABC News A Capitol Hill hearing that was supposed to be about religious freedom and a mandate that health insurers cover contraception in the United States began as an argument about whether Democrats could add a woman to the all-male panel. \\"Where are the women?\\" the minority Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked early in the hearing. She criticized the Republican committee chairman, Rep. Darrel Issa, for wanting to \\"roll back the fundamental rights of women to a time when the government thought what happens in the bedroom is their business.\\" \\"We will not be forced back to that primitive era,\\" she said. Issa bristled at the charge and said Democrats could not add their witness because she was not a member of the clergy, but a student at Georgetown. He also faulted Democrats for not submitting the name of the witness, Sandra Fluke, in time. Fluke would have talked about a classmate who lost an ovary because of a syndrome that causes ovarian cysts. Georgetown, which is affiliated with the Catholic Church, does not insure birth control, which is also used to treat the syndrome. Issa said the hearing is meant to be more broadly about religious freedom and not specifically about the contraception mandate in the Health Reform law. The congressional hearing suggested that the Obama administration went too far with its mandate that all insurers except churches - including non-church religious affiliated organizations - must offer health insurance. It's titled \\"Lines Crossed: Separation of Church and State. Has the Obama Administration Trampled on Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Conscience?\\" Among the witnesses invited by Issa to attend the hearing was a representative of the Catholic bishops, who oppose the Obama administration \\"accommodation\\" on birth-control coverage. Joining them are many other men of other religions. Not invited, complained Democrats, were representatives from the Catholic Health Association, which is run by a woman and actually runs the Catholic hospitals, nor Catholic Charities, both of which said Friday they supported the president's plan. Ranking committee member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., wanted to invite third-year Georgetown Law Center student Sandra Fluke to testify, telling Issa it was important to have at least one woman at the witness table because the issue involved health repercussions for women. Read Fluke's full testimony here. Issa's staff sent a letter to the Democrats, saying, \\"As the hearing is not about reproductive rights but instead about the administration's actions as they relate to freedom of religion and conscience, he believes that Ms. Fluke is not an appropriate witness.\\" \\"It was just crushing to hear the chairman's reason to not allow my testimony,\\" Fluke told ABC News. \\"I can understand that [the issue] is connected to religion, but I don't understand how you can have an open conversation without hearing from the women who have been personally affected by this.\\" Cummings, the ranking Democrat, and Maloney asked Issa to reconsider and let Fluke testify, noting she was in the audience, when the hearing got underway Thursday. \\"It was staggering to sit there and feel like this panel of men was going to talk about my health and women like me,\\" Fluke said. \\"It felt so very wrong.\\" Rep. Cummings accused Issa of creating \\"conspiracy hearing\\" and stacking the witness list by refusing to allow women \\"commits a massive injustice by trying to pretend that the views of millions of women across the country are meaningless.\\" A terse back and forth followed between Issa, Maloney and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C., about what the true purpose of the hearing was and whether a violation of rules existed. Issa pointed out that Democrats barred Republican witnesses when they were in the majority. Two women were featured on the second panel, one a female physician. In what seemed like a move to drive home his point, Issa's first witness used a hypothetical example of the government forcing a Jewish orthodox-owned deli to serve pork, as a comparison to the Health and Human Services' mandate for religious employers. The next three witnesses asked why the government was getting involved in the conscience of the American people. \\"Religious people determine what violates their conscience, not the federal government,\\" the Rev. Jonah Paffhausen, Washington archbishop of the Orthodox Church in America, said. \\"Please get the federal government, Mr. Chairman, out of our consciences.\\" Congressman Danny K. Davis asked the witnesses about their position regarding the ability of birth control to offer other preventative care for woman (such as ovarian cancer prevention) offered and endorsed by groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Public Health Association.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the two people who begin a duel on a forest planet? is inside the article: The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled \\"Bond of the Force\\". Gregory plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer plays the offscreen voice of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies—specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James and Stewart. The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film Star Trek Generations and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm., can you guess it ?","completion":"Based on the given information in the article, the two people who begin a duel on a forest planet are Gregory, who plays the character Jacen Solo, and Zarth, who plays the character Darth Katai.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the rule was needed because battery-powered vehicles are very quiet. It said the rule would particularly help blind pedestrians, or those with a visual impairment, detect electric cars and hybrids on the road. The new safety rule could help prevent 2,400 injuries a year, said the NHTSA. The rule demands that the cars make a noise when travelling either forwards or backwards at speeds of less than 30km/h (19mph). The regulation covers vehicles with four wheels that weigh less than 10,000 pounds (4.5 tonnes). The safety specification requires car makers to use a two-tone signal similar to that currently emitted by heavy vehicles when they are reversing. At higher speeds, said the NHTSA, tyre and wind noise would be loud enough to alert people to the presence of a vehicle. \\"We all depend on our senses to alert us to possible danger,\\" said Anthony Foxx, US transportation secretary, in a statement. He added that it had become more important to hear vehicles as quieter hybrid and electric cars become more popular.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the birds that returned through Sudan? is inside the article: After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea., can you guess it ?

Frontex, the European Union border agency, says the majority of people residing illegally in the EU arrived by plane with a valid travel visa and simply stayed on after their visa expired.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the country that the people of Sikkim attempted to join through vote and failed twice in the 1940s? from the following article ? Nathu La is located on the 563 km (350 mi) Old Silk Route, an offshoot of the historic Silk Road. The Old Silk Route connects Lhasa in Tibet to the plains of Bengal to the south. In 1815, trade volume increased after the British annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, Nepalese, and Bhutanese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened. Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903–1904 British expedition to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet. In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957.

Touching your ears with unwashed hands can transfer oil and bacteria to the skin, which clogs the pores and causes pimples. Make sure to keep the shell of your ear, your earlobes, and behind your ear cleaned. Shampoo, gel, and other hair products can get on the ear and cause pimples. Use soap and water and clean when you shower or wash your face and hair. Clean the inside of your ear when needed. Make sure to irrigate the ear with solution and don't use cotton swabs inside your ear. Wipe your ear after every shower. This is when the pores are slightly open, so you can remove excess oil and help reduce blackheads. Another common way of getting ear pimples is through the telephone. Wipe down your cell phone after use. It is especially important to wipe down a telephone if you share it with other people. Since earbuds go into your ears, they can get caked with oil, earwax, and other dirt and grime. When earbuds are out of your ear, they can pick up dirt and other contaminants. When you place them back in your ears, that stuff transfers. Use an alcohol wipe to clean your earbuds after each use. If the pimple is in your external ear, don't use earphones until it is gone. This will aggravate the pimple. Wipe over it with an anti-bacterial wipe, since the pimple could return if your earphones are dirty. If you get ear acne often, your ear is covered with black dots, or you have a zit that is draining fluid, you need to see your doctor. You also should see a doctor if your ear blemish is very painful and lasts longer than a week. They can give you something to help clear it up and determine if the underlying cause is hormonal.

Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What does Jimmy's father do for a job? Based on Andrea Yates and her family, the five children being drowned in the family bathroom by their mother. In the film itself, which is set in a secluded family farm, the mother suffers a psychotic break down due to postpartum depression and after her husband, a truck driver, hits the road again after only being home a day. It's all too much for her and she snaps, begins to break things in the middle of dinner. She then calmly walks away with the baby to the upstairs bedroom. Jimmy, the eldest son, trying to keep his younger brother and sister calm, starts cleaning up, but soon he decides to check on his mother and discovers the horrible truth. His baby brother is dead, and she's preparing to take care of the rest of her kids. Now hope for the family's survival rests on the shoulder of Jimmy, the eldest son and surrogate man of the house. After his mother tries to drown his sister and he knocks her out, Jimmy gets his brother onto a bike and tells him to ride for help while trying to get his sister to safety. Using his wits and intricate knowledge of the farm, Jimmy must try to protect his siblings while fending off the woman he has always known and loved as his mother. Only one of the children survives as the mother stalks a further two of them down and kills them in typical slasher style. Jimmy manages to survive up until his father arrives back after hearing him on a radio transmission. The film then cuts to a hospital and Jimmy is set to come home. His father then tells Jimmy that his mother is also coming home, much to Jimmy's surprise. We are then shown the mother, stood pregnant and singing rock-a-bye baby.

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas. (St. Mary's later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \\"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Don't get thrown into the friend zone. Gain her respect. Laugh at her jokes. Liven up your appearance. Be approachable.\\"","completion":"Title: Beyond the 'Friend Zone': Gaining Respect, Fostering Laughter, and Enhancing Appearance Establishing a solid connection with a person you're attracted to is an exceptional endeavor, but it can backfire quite unexpectedly when you are confined into the so-called 'friend zone'. The friend zone, a term widely used amongst millennials and Gen Z, is a predicament where one individual in a platonic relationship wishes to enter into a romantic relationship while the other does not. The encapsulating struggle is real – and for many, it can be a crushing reality to accept. However, escaping the friend zone is not an impossible mission. It's all about injecting respect, generating laughter, renovating your appearance, and being approachable. Let's break it down. First and foremost, gaining her respect is an absolute prerequisite in any budding relationship – romantic or otherwise. Respect acts as a cornerstone that paves the way for mutual understanding and shared values. Show genuine interest in her preferences, listen attentively to her stories, and acknowledge her opinions. Make it clear that you appreciate her not just as a romantic interest, but as an individual person with unique perspectives and experiences. This engenders a sense of respect and admiration, which can often be a stepping stone to deeper emotional connections outside of friendship. Humor is an invaluable tool in romantic relationships. By laughing at her jokes, you not only show that you enjoy her company, but also that you value her wit and sense of humor. Sharing a good laugh creates a bond, dissolves barriers, and allows for a deeper sense of connection. Meaningful conversation paired with playful banter can often lead to increasing affection. However, the key is to laugh genuinely and not just for the sake of it. Forced laughter always backfires, leading to awkward moments and denying genuine connection. They say the first impression is the last impression, and indeed, your appearance plays a vital role here. An elevated appearance doesn't necessarily mean wearing branded clothes or expensive accessories. It's about presenting yourself as an individual who understands and projects personal style and hygiene. Dress neatly, maintain good grooming, and most importantly, feel comfortable in what you're wearing. Your appearance should speak volumes about your personality, portraying you as dynamic, confident, and aware of your own style. Being approachable involves a blend of good communication skills and the right body language. Maintain eye contact when talking to show that you’re genuinely interested in her. Use open body language to exhibit a welcoming persona. Pay attention to your tone and volume when conversing, ensuring you're polite and respectful. Encourage her to express herself freely, and respond with empathy and understanding. Being approachable means you're an easy person to talk to, suggesting a potential partner rather than just a friend. Navigating the path from being 'just friends' to something more can be a tricky endeavor. It requires a balance of respect, humor, smart appearance, and approachability. The journey requires patience, understanding, and the ability to accept that not every friendship is meant to turn into a romantic relationship. However, by emphasizing these core traits, you're undoubtedly positioned for success, whether that leads to romance or a deep, respectful friendship that's rewarding in its own right."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: All-Pro CB Darrelle Revis, Jets agree to terms on new deal The All-Pro cornerback and the New York Jets agreed in principle to a four-year contract Sunday night, reaching a deal a week before the team's season opener. The Jets wouldn't disclose financial terms, but the Daily News reported it was worth 46 million, including 32 million guaranteed. \\"Barring something unforeseen, we expect Darrelle to be here (Monday),\\" general manager Mike Tannenbaum said during a conference call early Monday morning. THE HUDDLE: Ramifications of Revis deal Revis planned to fly from his home in South Florida to New Jersey on Monday, and is expected to finalize the deal and end a 36-day holdout. \\"This is an intermediate step to what we hope is an entire career of Darrelle as a Jet,\\" Tannenbaum said, \\"for him to retire a Jet, for him to hopefully go to the Hall of Fame one day as a Jet and for him to be in our ring of honor.\\" Revis, who made no public statements about the sometimes acrimonious negotiations since minicamp in June, used his Twitter account to thank his family and agents, Neil Schwartz and Jonathan Feinsod. \\"To my family, neil, & john I love u guys I'm comin home baby!!!\\" Revis wrote. \\"Revis Island LET'S GO.\\" Both owner Woody Johnson and coach Rex Ryan flew down to South Florida on Saturday and met with Revis, mother Diana Gilbert, and uncle and former NFL player Sean Gilbert over the weekend to try to help get a deal done. \\"I think that was an important step in the process, but there was still obviously more work to be done,\\" Tannenbaum said. \\"We spent all day looking at it and probably about (11 p.m. Sunday), we made a very significant breakthrough to finding a landing spot that was good for both sides.\\" Ryan was scheduled to have a conference call with reporters Saturday night to discuss the Jets' roster cutdown, but Tannenbaum handled it instead. A team spokesman said Ryan was unavailable because he was at an \\"appointment.\\" That turned out to be a visit with the man whom Ryan has repeatedly called the best cornerback in the NFL. The new contract means Revis will likely be back on the field in time for the opener next Monday night against Baltimore at the New Meadowlands Stadium. \\"That'll be Rex's call,\\" Tannenbaum said. The general manager said he \\"had no idea\\" what corresponding roster move the Jets would make once Revis was signed, sealed and delivered. \\"I'm sure Rex will be able to figure out what to do to get Darrelle on the team,\\" Tannenbaum quipped. Revis' holdout began Aug. 1, when the team reported for training camp in Cortland. Tannenbaum said the nearly 600,000 in fines Revis accrued for sitting out would be handled internally by the team. He was scheduled to make 1 million in the fourth year of his six-year rookie deal, but said he wanted to become the league's highest-paid cornerback. While he didn't get that this time around, he's getting the guaranteed money he sought during negotiations over the last several months. With NFL Films cameras following the Jets all summer for HBO's Hard Knocks series, Revis' holdout was a major story line without him ever appearing in an episode. He'll certainly be a major focus in Wednesday night's series finale, especially since Tannenbaum acknowledged he wasn't sure the deal would ever get done and said the Jets looked into trades over the weekend for other cornerbacks. \\"This was one of those things where I really wasn't optimistic,\\" Tannenbaum said. \\"I really wasn't. I'm an optimist by nature, but this was really hard. There was a lot of heavy lifting, a lot of work put into it.\\" Since early August, the team and Revis' agents agreed to keep all negotiations confidential after things got testy through the media. There were some accusations made by both sides, with Johnson saying he was \\"rebuffed\\" by Revis' agents when he asked if he could be part of a meeting at the Roscoe Diner in Roscoe, N.Y.. Schwartz responded by saying that was \\"a blatant lie\\" and that Johnson was given \\"incorrect\\" information. He also said he'd meet Johnson \\"any time, any place.\\" Ryan even got into it, suggesting he give the team a day off from practice so the entire organization could sit down with Revis, his agents and anyone else the star player wanted in an effort to complete a deal. Then came a code of silence from both sides — and the fear that Revis could sit out the entire season, as his uncle once did. In the end, though, Revis will be back with the team in time to begin a season Ryan and the Jets are convinced will be special. \\"I'm happy, I'm relieved,\\" Tannenbaum said. \\"Obviously, Darrelle's a great player. He's our guy and he's an important piece to what we're trying to accomplish here. ... I don't think anyone wanted it to take as long as it did, but it did. Now, we can put it behind us and move on to Baltimore.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Weather Report was an American jazz fusion band of the 1970s and early 1980s. The band was initially co-led by the Austrian-born keyboard player Joe Zawinul, the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Czech bassist Miroslav Vitous. Due to creative and financial disagreements, Vitous left the band after a few years. Zawinul took increasing control and steered the band towards a more funk, R&B oriented sound. On the recommendation of Michal Urbaniak, Zawinul and Shorter recruited the 23-year-old drummer Omar Hakim, a talented session player and multi-instrumentalist, who had played with a variety of musicians (including Mike Mainieri, David Bowie, and Carly Simon). Hakim was immediately entrusted with recruiting the rest of the new rhythm section. Having failed to secure Marcus Miller as bass guitarist, he selected Victor Bailey (a recent graduate from the Berklee College of Music, with whom Hakim had played while backing Miriam Makeba). Hakim also recruited percussion/concertina player Jose Rossy, with whom he had worked in Labelle. The new Weather Report went straight onto tour. The music developed on tour was later recorded for the 1983 album Procession, which showed the band beginning to make something of a return to the \\"world music\\", which it had pioneered in the mid-1970s, and featured a cameo appearance from The Manhattan Transfer. Continuing with the same lineup, Weather Report recorded the Domino Theory album in 1984, with Hakim stepping into Jaco Pastorius' old role as Zawinul's co-producer. The album was Weather Report's first album to employ drum machines and samplers (the Emulator), furthering developing the band's involvement with technology, and also featured a guest vocal from Carl Anderson. The band was beginning to suffer from the revival of more traditionally styled jazz at the time, which made it harder to market jazz fusion. Percussionist and singer Mino Cinelu replaced Rossy in the spring of 1984 and appeared on the band's video release Live in Japan (reissued on DVD in 2007). The same lineup played on 1985's Sportin' Life album, which included a cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" and appearances by Bobby McFerrin and Carl Anderson. In keeping with Zawinul's technological curiosity, the album heralded the arrival of MIDI, which allowed him to rapidly and inexpensively write, demonstrate, and record music via a set of synthesizers.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – Ever done something you wished you could take back? Like accidentally sent an email to 33,000 Thomson Reuters employees? That's what some guy named Vince apparently did yesterday, flooding inboxes and setting off a \\"reply all\\" chain that some say slowed down Reuters email and provided the Internet with Twitter gold, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some tweets using the #ReutersReplyAllGate hashtag expressed frustration at the hundreds of reply-all emails asking people to stop replying to all, while others used the chaos to grab their 15 minutes of fame (being listed in the \\"to\\" field) and laugh at the inherent inanity of it all. \\"Should I just start live tweeting every single reply?\\" one recipient wondered, while another called for extraordinary assistance, imploring, \\"Any Super Hero currently in the U.S. Your help is needed to stop this email chain.\\" But as the debacle continues to generate fresh reply-all emails this morning, what's happened to poor Vince? One Reuters worker remains concerned, tweeting, \\"Where is Vince? Hope he's ok! #ReutersReplyAllGate #prayforvince.\\" (Gmail users need not make Vince's mistake.) Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, in a big office full of people typing away at their computers, a man named Vince did something by accident. It's like when you drop your ice cream on the ground or spill juice on a newly cleaned table cloth. Only, Vince's accident was a much bigger oopsie! He sent an email to 33,000 people who all worked at the same place, a company named Thomson Reuters. Just imagine sending a letter to everyone in your school, including all the teachers and students, even the janitor and the principal, by mistake! Just how a small pebble tossed in a lake causes ripples that spread far and wide, Vince's little accident caused lots of reactions. All those people started receiving this unexpected email and their computers began working extra hard, just like when you have to pick up your toys really fast because it's time for bed. And guess what those 33,000 people did then? They all began clicking 'reply all' on Vince's email, telling others to stop replying to everyone. It turned into a funny loop! Imagine if you say “stop shouting” by shouting yourself, isn't that funny? Some people thought it was super funny and took to Twitter, an online place where people share quick thoughts or jokes, to share about this funny event with the hashtag #ReutersReplyAllGate. A hashtag is like a label or sticker that helps people find all the messages about the same topic. Some of these people even tried to act like superstars and used the situation to draw attention to themselves. It's like seeing a rainbow during a rainstorm and running to tell all your friends about it, just so you can be the one who spotted it. One person even joked about writing a tweet for each reply they got on the email. Imagine if you tried to draw every bird you saw flying in the sky, you would have a whole book of bird drawings in no time! Another person asked if there was a superhero who could come and stop all the emails, just like when you wish for a magical cleaning fairy to tidy up your room. But while all this was going on, some people wondered: what happened to Vince, the man who accidentally started all this in the first place? One person even shared a message hoping that Vince was okay, using the same hashtag #ReutersReplyAllGate and another one #prayforvince. This story shows us that we all make mistakes sometimes, and that's okay. Even grown-ups like Vince do, right? But we can also use these moments to laugh and make the best out of them. So next time you do an oopsie, remember, you're not alone! Even big companies like Gmail are learning from Vince's mistake and making safeguards so something similar doesn’t happen there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I absolutely had to write a review for the Sunny Side Café after my recent visit – it was such an outstanding experience from beginning to end! I visited the café last Sunday for brunch with a group of friends, and despite the busy hour, we received a warm welcome from the staff. They quickly escorted us to a cozy, sunlit table by the window. I must mention the ambiance first – the delightful interior, with its eclectic mix of modern and rustic vibes, made for a perfect setting to enjoy a leisurely meal with friends. The soft music playing in the background added to the overall pleasant atmosphere. Now, let's talk about the menu – it was extensive and thoughtfully curated, offering something for everyone, from decadent French toast for those with a sweet tooth to fresh avocado toast and kale salad for the health-conscious. The fact that they accommodate dietary restrictions and allergies was a big plus for one of my vegan friends. We started off by ordering a round of fresh-squeezed orange juice and some delightful mimosas. I couldn't have been happier with my choice of the eggs Benedict Classic, which featured perfectly poached eggs, smoked ham, and a heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The accompanying hash browns were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the way I like them. One of my friends raved about the shakshuka – a Mediterranean dish made with poached eggs, tomatoes, and sautéed vegetables, served with warm naan bread. The freshness and quality of the ingredients truly shined through in every dish we tried. What really set Sunny Side Café apart for me, though, was the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. Our server, Samantha, was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations for those of us having trouble deciding on a dish. She frequently checked in on us and refilled our drinks with a genuine smile that made us feel truly valued as customers. Lastly, the pace of the meal was just right – even during their busy brunch service, we never felt rushed. We had ample time to enjoy our delicious food and each other's company in the cozy atmosphere they provided. In conclusion, I cannot recommend Sunny Side Café enough for anyone searching for a delightful brunch experience – it offers a wonderful combination of delicious food, attentive service, and a cozy ambiance. I look forward to returning soon to try more items from their amazing menu!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The game started when the 49ers attempted an onside kick, recovered by the Jets. Later, the 49ers went up first as Shaun Hill completed a pass to Jason Hill that was fumbled at the goal line and recovered by offensive tackle Joe Staley for the touchdown. Then, Brett Favre ran for a 2-yard touchdown. The 49ers retook the lead as Shaun Hill completed a touchdown screen pass to Frank Gore. After half-time, Thomas Jones plowed through the 49ers secondary to get a 17-yard score. On the ensuing 49ers possession, a Shaun Hill touchdown pass to Delanie Walker was called back, and the 49ers settled for a Joe Nedney 32-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the 49ers cemented their lead when Shaun Hill completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to a diving Bryant Johnson. The Jets had enough time to make a late comeback, but a Brett Favre deep pass was intercepted by Walt Harris. The 49ers ran down the clock and punted, and the Jets did not have sufficient time to attempt the comeback. The 49ers fumbled the ball a total of 5 times, although, fortunately for them, only one was lost. With the win, the 49ers improved to 5-8.

Also, credit reports sometimes list the incorrect payment status on accounts or don’t include remedied problems, such as an account paid in full. If you find errors, then dispute them with the credit reporting bureau whose report contains the error. It can take up to 60 days to complete the dispute process, so plan accordingly.

Now, let's examine the reasons that make this review negative by analyzing its content: 1. The first statement in the review is \\"Would not recommend this place.\\" This clearly states the reviewer's negative sentiment towards the establishment as they are directly stating that they cannot recommend it to others. A positive review typically starts with a recommendation or praise for the service or product. 2. The second sentence mentions \\"arrogant management\\" and \\"mediocre food,\\" both of which have a negative connotation. The use of the word \\"arrogant\\" implies that the reviewer had a bad experience with management, who may have displayed a condescending or unprofessional attitude. Additionally, by calling the food \\"mediocre,\\" the reviewer means that it is of average or low quality, which further emphasizes the negative nature of the review. 3. The review then describes how the group of 15-20 people visited this place annually for the past few years following the Crazy Legs run event in Madison. This detail reveals that the reviewer has given the establishment multiple chances, but despite these apparent repeated visits, they express dissatisfaction with their experience, reinforcing the negative sentiment. 4. The final sentence mentions that \\"Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next year's event.\\" This emphasizes a collective negative sentiment among the members of the group who visited the place. The fact that the entire group agreed to find an alternative venue for their next gathering is a strong statement against the establishment, indicating serious dissatisfaction. Taking all these points into consideration, it is evident that the review holds a negative sentiment towards the establishment.

When I first started, I thought I had only to remember the new words and learn some grammar I knew little about English idioms .I thought each English word had the same meaning in Chinese. When I learn to say\\"I see a book on the desk,\\" I thought the English word \\"see \\" was just like the Chinese word \\" kan \\",So one day when my teacher asked me,\\" what are you doing?\\", I answered, \\"I'm seeing a book.\\" \\"That's wrong .\\" the teacher said, \\"you don't see a book, You read a book. You can't use English word like a Chinese one.. Be sure not to make the same mistake again.\\" After that I began to pay more attention to the differences between Chinese and English. For example, in English we say a\\" high mountain\\", but a\\" tall man. \\" In Chinese we use the same word \\"gao \\" for both.. Again in English we say\\" take part in the sports meeting \\", \\" attend the meeting \\" and\\" join the army,\\" while in Chinese we can use \\"can jia \\" for all three. Interesting ,isn't? So to study English doesn't only mean hard wok, it can be great fun, too!

Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard.

The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \\"The Four Books on Human Proportion\\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.

A man in a Paris hospital who needs blood, a woman in Mexico who was injured in an earthquake, and a family in India that lost their home in a storm may all be aided by the Red Cross. The Red Cross exists in almost every country around the world. The world Red Cross organizations are sometimes called the Red Crescent, the Red Mogen Daid, the Sun, and the Red Lion. All of these agencies share a common goal of trying to help people in need. The idea of forming an organization to help the sick and wounded during a war started with Jean Henri Dunant. In 1859, he observed how people were suffering on a battlefield in Italy. He wanted to help all the wounded people regardless of which side they were fighting for. The most important result of his work was an international treaty called the Geneva Convention . It protects prisoners of war, the sick and wounded, and other citizens during a war. The American Red Cross was set up by Clara Barton in 1881. Today the Red Cross in the United States provides a number of services for the public, such as helping people in need, teaching first aid and providing blood.

This article: Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat?, what is it ?","completion":"The last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat is Ferrier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The money, sent on behalf of South Africa, was meant to be used for its Caribbean diaspora legacy programme. But documents suggest Mr Warner used the payment for cash withdrawals, personal loans and to launder money. The 72-year-old, who has been indicted by the US FBI for corruption, denies all claims of wrongdoing. Fifa says it is co-operating with the investigation. And South Africa's Football Association has issued a detailed statement denying any wrongdoing. The papers seen by the BBC detail three wire transfers by Fifa. In the three transactions - on 4 January, 1 February and 10 March 2008 - funds totalling 10m (Â£6.5m) from Fifa accounts were received into Concacaf accounts controlled by Jack Warner. At the time, he was in charge of the body, which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean. The money had been promised by South Africa's Football Association for its so-called diaspora legacy programme to develop football in the Caribbean. The documents reveal how the money was spent and moved around. JTA Supermarkets, a large chain in Trinidad, received 4,860,000 from the accounts. The money was paid in instalments from January 2008 to March 2009. The largest payment was 1,350,000 paid in February 2008. US prosecutors say the money was mostly paid back to Mr Warner in local currency. Jack Warner: The US charge sheet Key questions answered Jack Warner: Controversial ex-Fifa chief Who are the indicted officials? Fifa in crisis - Special Reports The BBC gave details of its investigation to Brent Sancho, Trinidad and Tobago's sports minister and a former footballer. He said: \\"He [Mr Warner] must face justice, he must answer all of these questions. Justice has to be served. \\"He will have to account, with this investigation, he will have to answer for his actions.\\" The documents also show 360,000 of the Fifa money was withdrawn by people connected to Mr Warner. Nearly 1.6m was used to pay the former Fifa vice-president's credit cards and personal loans. The documents show the largest personal loan Mr Warner provided for himself was 410,000. The largest credit card payment was 87,000. Mr Sancho says he is now angry and disappointed. \\"I'm devastated because a lot of that money should have been back in football, back in the development of children playing the sport. \\"It is a travesty. Mr Warner should answer the questions,\\" he added. Jack Warner is one of 14 people charged by US prosecutors over alleged corruption at Fifa. The US Justice department alleges the 14 accepted bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than 150m (Â£97m) over a 24-year period. Mr Warner denies all charges of corruption. He resigned from Fifa's executive committee and all other football commitments in 2011 amid allegations he had bribed his Caribbean associates. He later stepped down as Trinidad and Tobago's security minister amid a fraud inquiry. A key figure in the deepening scandal, in a recent statement he said he had given lawyers documents outlining the links between Fifa, its funding, himself and the 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago. He said the transactions also included Mr Blatter. \\"I will no longer keep secrets for them who actively seek to destroy the country,\\" he said in an address on Trinidadian TV last week entitled \\"The gloves are off\\". Speaking to his supporters at a rally later the same day, he promised an \\"avalanche\\" of revelations to come. Mr Warner, who faces extradition to the US, was released on bail after handing himself in to police in the Trinidad and Tobago capital Port of Spain last week. He says he is an innocent scapegoat who will soon reveal the truth of what happened inside Fifa.

Determine the sentiment: One of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not Borat or The Departed but a 2005 documentary about Jesus Christ called The God Who Wasn't There by director Brian Flemming, an ex-Christian Fundamentalist. Flemming, in his 62-minute documentary, asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions. Using interviews with authors, philosophers, and historians to debunk the long-held Christian belief that Jesus, the son of God, lived among men, was crucified, and was resurrected, Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt, Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology, and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities. In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults, he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story, the four gospels, were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus' crucifixion and that the letters of St. Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure. Flemming, unfortunately however, is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion. Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price. The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher, the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com, and Ronald Sipus, principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School, which Flemming attended as a boy. Like Michael Moore's interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine, his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle. In a sarcastic tone, Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth, then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser, who cut her baby's arm off for God. He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians \\"look forward to the day when all non-Christians are thrown into a lake of fire, howling and screeching.\\" To further turn us against Christianity, Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture. What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion. In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts, he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester, a famous Christian pacifist, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice, and Mother Teresa, whose work was about respect for each individual's worth and dignity. His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points, yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines, there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD, long after the New Testament. Also it is important to note one major difference. The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god. This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God's will to mankind. Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter. What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind's spiritual evolution. Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many, Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love, and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man. While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed, what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together. While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects, in the words of Annie Besant, \\"spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect. The God Who Wasn't There is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others.","completion":"The sentiment of this text is mostly negative and critical. It talks about a documentary that tries to prove Jesus was not a real person, but the writer feels that the documentary is not a fair investigation and focuses more on attacking Christianity and other religions, rather than having a serious discussion about the topic. The writer believes it is important for people to respect each other's beliefs and have a positive conversation about religion, instead of using it as a way to fight or criticize others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Who is Annie Dillard? Options: A. A great writer B. not enough information C. A poet D.

To do this, we first want to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation (-1089) by adding 1089 to both sides of the equation. This will give us: 126*m - 1089 + 1089 = -207 + 1089 Which simplifies to: 126*m = 882 Step 2: Now, we need to isolate 'm' by dividing both sides by the coefficient of 'm' (which is 126): 126*m / 126 = 882 / 126 This simplifies to: m = 7 So the solution to the equation 126*m - 1089 = -207 is m = 7."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"People who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods frequently. This is because high salt foods are often found in processed and fast foods, which are calorie-dense. Additionally, the preference for salty and fatty foods is associated with higher overall calorie consumption and uncontrolled eating patterns. Therefore, it is likely that individuals who prefer a calorie-dense diet would also consume high salt foods on a regular basis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The equation given is -53209006 = -44*m - 53206278 2. We want to isolate the variable 'm', so first we need to move the constant number on the right hand side of equation to the left. We do this by adding 53206278 to both sides of the equation -53209006 + 53206278 = -44*m - 53206278 + 53206278 Once we simplify this step, our equation looks like: -2728 = -44m 3. After simplifying, we still need to isolate m. To do this, we'll need to divide both sides by -44 (since -44 is the coefficient of m) -2728 / -44 = -44m / -44 Further simplification gives us: m = 62 Hence, m = 62 is the solution for the given equation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy?

But tropical palm trees once flourished there. An intense warming phase occurred 52 million years ago, leading tropical vegetation, including palms and relatives of today's tropical Baobab trees, to grow on the continent’s now frozen coasts. The surprising discovery came from a study of drill cores obtained from the seafloor near Antarctica. The results, published in the journal Nature, show that warm ocean currents and high carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the air boosted temperatures, allowing tropical vegetation to grow where visitors today meet only icebergs and freezing cold. \\"The CO2 content of the atmosphere as assumed for that time interval is not enough on its own to explain the almost tropical conditions in the Antarctic,\\" said Jörg Pross, a paleoclimatologist at the Goethe University and member of the Biodiversity and Climate Research Center in Frankfurt, Germany. \\"Another important factor was the transfer of heat via warm ocean currents that reached Antarctica.\\" When the warm ocean current collapsed and the Antarctic coast came under the influence of cooler ocean currents, the tropical rainforests, palm trees and Baobab relatives also disappeared. The scientists used rock samples from drill cores on the seabed obtained off the coast of Wilkes Land, Antarctica, as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). The samples are between 53 and 46 million years old and contain fossil pollen and spores that are known to originate from the Antarctic coastal region. The researchers were thus able to reconstruct the local vegetation on Antarctica and, accordingly, interpret the presence of tropical and subtropical rainforests covering the coastal region 52 million years ago. The scientists' evaluations show that the winter temperatures on the Wilkes Land coast were warmer than 50 degrees Fahrenheit at that time, despite three months of polar night. The continental interior, however, was noticeably cooler, with the climate supporting the growth of temperate rainforests characterized by southern beech and Araucaria trees of the type common in New Zealand today. Additional evidence of extremely mild temperatures was provided by analysis of organic compounds that were produced by soil bacteria populating the soils along the Antarctic coast. \\"By studying naturally occurring climate warming periods in the geological past, our knowledge of the mechanisms and processes in the climate system increases,\\" Pross said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Scientists have discovered that tropical palm trees and related vegetation once flourished in Antarctica 52 million years ago due to an intense warming phase, high CO2 levels, and warm ocean currents.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" Question: \\"Possum Kingdom Lake is in which Texas county?\\" Answer: \\"Brad\\" Is this answer correct?

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. and a hint : Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Please answer this question : Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","completion":"Group Yellow Step 1: Understand the situation In this situation, Group Brown was eating 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, leading to significant weight gain. Group Yellow maintained a normal diet. The hint also explains that unused energy from food is stored as fat, and a consistent excess of 3500 calories leads to the storage of 1 pound of body fat. Step 2: Relate the situation to health problems. The hint explains that obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater and increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Step 3: Compare the two groups. Group Brown consumed significantly more calories and gained a lot of weight. This excess caloric intake increases the likelihood of unused energy being stored as fat, increasing the risk of obesity and related health problems. Group Yellow, on the other hand, maintained a normal diet, which implies they would have a more stable weight and less likelihood of storing excess fat and developing obesity-related health problems. Step 4: Choose the group with the smaller chance of developing health problems. Since Group Yellow maintained a normal diet and would have a more stable weight compared to Group Brown, they would have a smaller chance of getting more health problems.

Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding important organs like the heart liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily. \\"Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not tat, said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create \\"fat maps\\" showing where people store fat.

Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside.Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat.Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat.They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat.Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere.

Answer:","completion":"The house in which Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis during World War II is located in the city of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. This historic house is famously known as the Anne Frank House or the Secret Annex (Achterhuis in Dutch). The address of the Anne Frank House is Prinsengracht 263-267, situated along one of the picturesque canals in the heart of the city. Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager, went into hiding with her family in July 1942 due to the widespread persecution of Jews by the Nazis. The family consisted of Anne's father, Otto Frank; her mother, Edith Frank; and her sister, Margot Frank. They were later joined by the Van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer, making a total of eight people living in hiding. The Secret Annex was a concealed section of the building where Anne's father, Otto Frank, had his office and warehouse for his business, the Opekta Works, which dealt in pectin, a gelling agent used in the production of jam. The entrance to the Secret Annex was hidden behind a movable bookcase, and the space inside comprised of several small rooms, including a small kitchen, a bathroom, and attic space. The clandestine residence was supported by several non-Jewish helpers who provided food, supplies, and news from the outside world. During their time in hiding, Anne Frank documented her experiences, thoughts, and feelings in a diary, which has since become an essential historical chronicle of the Holocaust and a literary masterpiece in its own right. Sadly, the residents of the Secret Annex were discovered in August 1944, following an anonymous tip to the German authorities. The occupants were arrested and deported to various concentration camps, where most of them, including Anne and Margot, ultimately perished. Otto Frank was the only member of the group who survived the Holocaust. Upon his return to Amsterdam, he discovered Anne's diary and worked tirelessly to publish it, fulfilling his daughter's dream of becoming a writer. Today, the Anne Frank House has been converted into a museum dedicated to the memory of Anne Frank, the other occupants of the Secret Annex, and the millions of other victims of the Holocaust. Opened in 1960, the museum aims to educate visitors about this dark chapter of history and to promote tolerance and understanding. The museum not only allows visitors to explore the hidden rooms where the families lived during the war but also displays exhibits, photographs, and documents detailing Anne Frank's life and the historical context of the Holocaust. Additionally, Anne's original diary is on display at the museum, making it an essential destination for those seeking to learn about and pay tribute to the resilience of the human spirit during this tragic period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What will happen to Others? Select from the following. (a). win first place (b). be sad (c). be happy Answer:","completion":"When Cameron wins first place in a tournament, it means that they performed exceptionally well and managed to outperform the other competitors. While Cameron celebrates their victory, the outcome for others will depend on several factors such as their mindset, expectations, and the level of competition. (a) Win first place: As Cameron has already secured the first place, other competitors will not be able to win the first prize themselves. They will vie for the remaining positions, such as second place, third place, or other consolation prizes based on the rules and structure of the tournament. The competitors who perform well but unable to secure a higher position could still be recognized with special awards or honorable mentions. (b) Be sad: Some competitors may feel sad if they don't win first place or achieve their desired results. This could be due to their high expectations and the pressure they placed on themselves to succeed. Such individuals may feel disappointed and frustrated. However, these emotions are normal and can be an essential part of the learning process. Competitors who experience these emotions can reflect on their performance, learn from the mistakes they made and work on improving their skills for future competitions. (c) Be happy: There are also competitors who may be happy with their performance in the tournament despite not winning the first place. They could be satisfied with their results if they know they gave their best effort, displayed sportsmanship, and enjoyed the camaraderie among other participants. Many individuals participate in competitions not just for the desire to win but also for the love of the game, personal growth, and the opportunity to challenge themselves. These competitors might appreciate the opportunity to learn from the experience, regardless of the outcome, and would be motivated to continue participating in the future, building relationships and enjoying the sport or activity in which they were engaged. To summarize, when Cameron wins first place in a tournament, others could experience various emotions – feeling proud for securing other winning positions, being sad due to unmet expectations, or being happy with their personal accomplishments. The result for each individual will depend on their personal goals, aspirations, and perspectives on competition. It is essential to understand that the process of competing and learning from it can be just as valuable as the outcome, and competitors should strive towards personal growth and improvement regardless of their rank in the tournament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Q:SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

The 28-year-old Hamilton will partner Germany's Nico Rosberg for the upcoming 2013 season, a pairing described by team principal Ross Brawn as \\"the strongest driver line-up in Formula One.\\" But both Hamilton and Rosberg will be hoping the new Mercedes F1 W04 -- unveiled Monday in Jerez in Spain ahead of pre-season testing -- will be competitive. Hamilton, the 2008 world champion with McLaren, has no doubts that he will achieve his goals. Rosberg has also been impressed by the hunger for success at","completion":"Mercedes and believes this drive can propel them to the top of the Formula One hierarchy. After spending several seasons at Williams and establishing himself as a consistent points-scorer, the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg joined Mercedes in 2010. Since then, he has secured one race victory - the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix - and a few podiums but has yet to mount a serious title challenge. As the 2013 season approached, both Hamilton and Rosberg were optimistic that the new F1 W04 car would provide them with the platform to compete with the dominant Red Bull Racing, Ferrari, and McLaren teams. The W04 was a significant evolution of the previous year's model, built around a new aerodynamic concept, and featured innovative designs aimed at extracting maximum performance from the car's complex hybrid systems. In an interview ahead of the season's first race, Hamilton expressed his excitement at joining Mercedes and believed that the combination of the team's technical expertise and his own driving skills would eventually lead to success. \\"I couldn't be more excited to start my new journey with Mercedes,\\" Hamilton said. \\"I have been so impressed with the level of commitment and passion within the team, and there's a real hunger for winning here.\\" Rosberg echoed Hamilton's sentiments and felt that the team had taken a significant step forward in preparation for the 2013 campaign. \\"The atmosphere in the team is incredible,\\" Rosberg said. \\"Everyone is highly motivated and working together as a strong unit. We are all pushing each other to achieve our goals, and that's something I believe will only continue to grow throughout the season.\\" Team principal Ross Brawn, who had masterminded titles campaigns for Michael Schumacher at both Benetton and Ferrari, was confident his new driver pairing would prove to be the catalyst for a Mercedes renaissance. \\"In Lewis and Nico, we have a very talented and highly motivated duo,\\" Brawn explained. \\"I believe their combined abilities and experiences will enable us to compete at the highest level and challenge for the world championship.\\" As the season unfolded, it became clear that Mercedes had indeed made significant progress in terms of performance. The team managed to secure three consecutive pole positions, and Hamilton claimed his maiden victory with his new team at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Although the 2013 might not have turned out to be the championship-winning season they had hoped for, the impressive performances showed that the Hamilton-Rosberg partnership was a threat to the established front-runners. The seeds of success were sown during the 2013 season, and it wouldn't be long before Mercedes began to dominate Formula One. The introduction of new hybrid power units in 2014 provided Mercedes with a clear advantage over its rivals, and the team went on to secure seven consecutive constructors' championships from 2014 to 2020. Hamilton played a pivotal role in the team's success, capturing six more world titles, while Rosberg secured his first and only championship in 2016 before retiring from the sport.

Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired.

She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs â leaving him even more confused. Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner.

He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. Arthur looked up from the results of a night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye. \\"What is this?\\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. \\"I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \\"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \\"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \\"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \\"Do you hate the modern system of literature? Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?\\" For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head. \\"No, of course not… I– \\" \\"Then why,\\" Arthur barreled on, \\"do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Upon reaching an appropriate age (usually between 18 and 21 years), children are encouraged, but not forced, to \\"leave the nest\\" and begin an independent life. After children leave home, they often find social relationship and financial support outside the family. Parents do not arrange marriages for their children, nor do children usually ask permission of their parents to get married. Romantic love is most often the basis for marriage in the United States; young adults meet their future spouses through other friends, at jobs, and in organizations and religious institutions. Although children choose their own spouses, they still hope their parents will approve of their choices. In many families, parents feel that children should make major life decisions by themselves. A parent may try to influence a child to follow a particular profession but the child is free to choose another career. Sometimes children do exactly the opposite of what their parents wish in order to be independent. A son may decide not to go into his father's business on purpose because of a fear that he will lose his autonomy in his father's workplace. This independence from parents is not an indication that parents and children do not love each other. Strong love between parents and children is universal and this is no exception in the American family. Coexisting with such love in the American family are cultural values of self-reliance and independence. Question: Most young adults in the U.S. get married because of _ .

Paramedics think she was attacked by some type of animal. Doctors perform an emergency C-Section, and her baby (a boy) is born alive just as she dies.Thirty years later a young man named Dennis (Kenny Johnson) is riding in a car with an attractive redhead named Racquel (Traci Lords) heading to an underground nightclub (located, oddly, in a slaughterhouse) somewhere in Los Angeles. After addressing the doorman in Russian, Racquel brings the young man into the club. The man is confused and trying to understand the rules of the club. Some of the regulars indifferently push him aside. Saying he needs a drink, the sprinkler suddenly system activates, raining blood down on everyone inside. It is then that he (and the audience) realizes that everyone in the club is a vampire.Dennis desperately tries to get away and winds up at the feet of a menacing figure in a black-leather trenchcoat. The vampires look on this figure with awe, mumbling the words: \\"it's the Daywalker!\\" This is our first look at Blade (Wesley Snipes), the vampire killer.Blade pulls out a shotgun and opens fire on the vampires, who instantly burn to ashes when killed. When the gun is knocked out of his hands by Racquel, Blade uses a set of silver stakes to kill Racquel and more vampires, including the disk jockey. Soon all the vamps are either dead or have fled except for one; a heavyset vamp named Quinn (Donal Logue), whom Blade has apparently run into before. Blade pins Quinn to the wall, and then sets him on fire before confronting the last member in the club (the human man from the beginning). Finding no vampire bite marks on Dennis, Blade lets him live and makes his escape as the police arrive.Quinn is extinguished and taken to the local hospital.

If \\"A person holding a dog while they eat.\\", does this mean that \\"The dog is on someones laps.\\"?","completion":"To determine if \\"A person holding a dog while they eat\\" means \\"The dog is on someone's lap,\\" let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. Analyze the given phrase: In \\"A person holding a dog while they eat,\\" we have a person who is holding a dog. The person is also eating at the same time. Justification: The phrase tells us that the person is holding a dog, and they are eating. 2. Define the meaning of \\"holding\\": When a person is \\"holding\\" something, they are supporting it using their hands or arms. Justification: Dictionary definition of \\"holding\\" means to carry or support something with one's hands/arms. 3. Consider the position of the dog: Since the person is holding the dog while eating, it is likely that the dog is close to the person's body, which makes it possible for the dog to be on their lap. Justification: If the person has to hold the dog and eat simultaneously, the dog should be in a position that allows the person to use at least one hand to eat. 4. Determine if the dog is on someone's lap: Based on the information above, we can infer that it is quite possible for the dog to be on someone's lap, although it is not explicitly stated. Justification: As the person is holding the dog and eating at the same time, it is likely that the dog is on their lap to allow for easier multitasking. In conclusion, based on the analysis, we can infer that \\"A person holding a dog while they eat\\" could mean \\"The dog is on someone's lap,\\" although it is not explicitly stated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The best way to do this is by meditating and using breathing techniques. During meditation, the goal is to empty your mind of any thoughts and simply feel at peace. Breathing techniques are based on what works for an individual. Try breathing in as deeply as you can and then expelling all the air from your lungs and repeating the process. Listening to soothing music can act as a form of meditation. If you are feeling anxious, play music that will help to calm yourself down. Yoga can be an excellent form of meditation that combines both mental and physical exercise. Not getting enough sleep can aggravate your paranoia and make your symptoms worse. Because of this, it is important to make sure that you have a regular sleep schedule. Try to go to bed and get up around the same time each day. Don’t drink caffeine before bed, as this can throw off your sleeping patterns. While you may dislike when others question your rationale governing your fears and anxieties, it is important for you to reflect upon the motivations that inspire your actions and interactions. Ask yourself, “why am I fearful, suspicious, or anxious?” Try justifying your fears--do they make sense to you? You should also think about how these negative thoughts are affecting your well-being. Eat well-balanced meals and exercise as often as possible. It is important to keep yourself healthy so that you can feel good about yourself. Put food into your body that will make you feel good. Avoid things like alcohol and tobacco that can have a negative impact on both your physical and mental states. Like eating healthy food to increase your positivity, it is also important to do activities that will inspire positive feelings. Do things that you love, whether that means taking time to garden each day, go to the movies, or even go dancing. Create a positive outlet for yourself by working on a project that you enjoy. As a person with PPD, you should constantly be supplying yourself with positive thoughts. One way that you can do this is by reading and watching material that has uplifting content. Inspirational books and movies that discuss people overcoming great odds, be it psychologically, emotionally, or physically, can give you the fodder for your own inspirational fire. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses various strategies to manage and alleviate the symptoms of paranoia and anxiety.

Public buildings are structures that are maintained and funded by the government or by public organizations for the benefit and use of the community as a whole. These buildings often serve diverse functions and are designed to accommodate large numbers of people. Option A, a school, is not the best answer because while many citizens do enter schools, it is primarily limited to students, faculty, and staff. A school building's primary purpose is for education, and it may not always be accessible to the general public. Option C, a large building, is too vague and not specific enough to definitively state its use. Large buildings can have various purposes and may or may not be open to the public. Option D, an auditorium, is a more specific type of public building used primarily for performances and presentations. It is not the best answer because an auditorium is just one of the many types of public buildings that random citizens may use. Finally, option E, a convention center, is another specific type of public building used primarily for hosting large events, conferences, and exhibitions. Like an auditorium, it is not the best answer because a convention center is only one of the vast range of public buildings that citizens may enter. In conclusion, while each of these options describes a building that might have an entrance hall, the term \\"public building\\" is the best answer because it encompasses the widest variety of buildings that many random citizens would have access to and use, with an entrance hall serving as a common feature.

Article: Everyone has done experiments in high school laboratories,but have you ever thought about designing a satellite to explore space? On Nov.19,a team of students from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in the US awed peers and even scientists by successfully launching a satellite. The first satellite designed and built by high school students was sent up into space along with a record setting.28 other small ones on a rocket were sent from a NASA center in Virginia,CNN reported.It took the students seven years to build. The students call their tiny satellite TJ3Sat,which is named after their school.It is just 10x10x12 centimeters and weighs only 0.89 kilograms,according to Orbital Sciences,a company which developed the rocket and supported the students' project.It can be controlled with a smartphone. Like most satellites,TJ3Sat can send and receive data.The small spacecraft is equipped with a voice synthesizer ,which can switch text to voice and transmit those sounds back to Earth over radio waves,said Orbital officials.In this case,anyone can give it a try via the project's website (school website) by submitting a text.The texts that get approved will be sent to the satellite,changed to voice and then broadcast back to Earth via radio waves. \\"I can say 'Go Colonials'on our ground station and when it is on the other side of the world,in India,someone can hear'Go Colonials'over the radio,\\"the team explains on the website. The satellite will stay in space for at least three months.

At a time when American students are busy with SATs,the launch of the satellite shows what diligent teenagers can achieve when allowed to pursue their own curiosities,Glazer said. \\"It used to be that kids growing up wanted to be an astronaut,\\" Andrew Petro,program executive for small spacecraft technology at NASA,said in a...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Damned United Context: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.

Question: Did he trigger his hematophobia? Movie title: The Darwin Awards Movie plot: The film opens with a car with a JATO rocket strapped to it. The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car.

Hunter caused a lot of pain because of the fight with Justin, so","completion":"he couldn't avoid feeling a wave of guilt and remorse wash over him. He knew that it was not only the physical pain from the fight that had hurt Justin, but also the emotional turmoil that followed. Both boys had been friends since their childhood and rarely, if ever, had any conflicts between them. This situation, however, had spiraled out of control, leaving both of them lost, confused, and emotionally scarred. In the days following the fight, Hunter avoided Justin as much as possible. He knew that, although he wanted to apologize, it would be best for both of them to have some space to heal and process the altercation. Hunter had also sustained some physical injuries, but his pride had suffered the most. When he looked in the mirror each morning, he saw the marks on his face, reminding him of his impulsive actions – actions that had led him down a path he never intended to follow. As weeks passed, their mutual friends began to take notice of the distance between Hunter and Justin. There was a clear division within their group, as sides were taken, and whispers were exchanged. It became evident that the fallout from the fight was affecting more than just their own relationship – their entire social circle had been disrupted by it. Hunter spent most of his time replaying the events of that fateful day in his mind. Initially, the fight had started as just a disagreement over something trivial, but their fragile emotions had quickly escalated the situation. Old wounds had been reopened, revealing the deep-rooted issues that had been festering for years. As Hunter contemplated the reasons behind their fight, he realized that the root cause of their conflict wasn't about the trivial event itself but the mounting tensions that had been subconsciously growing over time. He recognized that they had been growing apart, with their individual lives pulling them in different directions. The realization made him regret their lack of open communication, and he began to understand how important it was to address the many emotions they had left unspoken. Feeling determined to salvage their friendship, Hunter finally decided to reach out to Justin. He picked up his phone and dialed the familiar number, his heart racing as the call connected. When Justin answered, there was an awkward silence as they both stumbled to find the right words. Hunter eventually found the courage to express his regret for his actions and the pain he had caused. He took responsibility for his part in their fight and the subsequent rift between them. Justin, however, was still cautious, even as he acknowledged Hunter's apologies. The wounds they had inflicted, both physical and emotional, would not heal overnight. In the weeks that followed, Hunter and Justin took careful steps towards rebuilding their friendship. They had many honest and heartfelt conversations, addressing the issues that had caused their conflict and discussing the steps they could take to ensure it would not happen again. Their friendship would never be exactly the same as it was before the fight, but through their vulnerability and willingness to grow, they ultimately were able to strengthen the bond between them. As the months passed, they slowly rediscovered their love and respect for each other, and their close-knit social circle began to mend as well. The events of that fateful day would forever serve as a reminder of the importance of empathy, understanding, and open communication in any relationship. From that point on, Hunter and Justin resolved to confront their emotions openly and honestly, knowing that it was the key to maintaining the lifelong friendship they both cherished."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After the ordeal gains the attention of numerous members of the household and community and Ted is carted off to a hospital, he subsequently loses contact with Mary. Thirteen years later, in 1998, 29-year-old Ted is still in love with Mary. On the advice of his best friend Dom (Chris Elliott), he hires a smarmy private detective named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down. Healy finds that she is an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami with her friend, Magda, and quickly falls in love with Mary as well. He lies to Ted about her, saying she is grossly overweight with many children, to discourage him from having any contact with her. Healy resorts to lying, cheating, stalking, and even drugging Magda's dog to win Mary over, but is exposed by Mary's architect friend, Tucker (Lee Evans), who is heavily reliant on crutches and speaks with an English accent. Enraged, Healy tails Tucker and discovers him to be a fraud himself: he is an able-bodied, entirely American pizza delivery boy who is also in love with Mary.

Answer the following question: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

Options: [-] no; [-] yes;","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question revolves around comparing the political fates of Donald Trump, former President of the United States, and Rob Ford, the late former mayor of Toronto. The implication is whether Donald Trump could end up with political struggles or controversies similar to those experienced by Rob Ford. Rob Ford had a turbulent political career, facing many personal and substance-abuse scandals, which ultimately led to his political downfall. While there are certain similarities between the two politicians, such as their populist appeal and frequent controversies, drawing a direct comparison between them requires analyzing their political careers, public and personal lives, and sociopolitical contexts in which they emerged. Regarding the second question, it appears to be a statement seeking forgiveness for a murder committed in a sudden and extreme emotional state, followed by a question about how educated people would perceive the situation in the context of the movie \\"Rustom.\\" \\"Rustom\\" is an Indian film that centers around a naval officer who murders his wife's lover upon discovering their affair.

Answer the following question: Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. suppose Less proteins are replaced with minerals happens, how will it affect more fossils can be formed. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of less proteins being replaced with minerals during the fossilization process can be classified as directly impacting a step of the process. This impact occurs specifically in the step where the proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil, leading to the formation of a rock-like substance called a fossil. A decrease in the replacement of proteins with minerals can affect the overall fossil formation in a couple of ways: 1. Incomplete fossilization: If less protein is replaced with minerals, the fossil may not be as well preserved or may not form completely. This could result in the bones being weaker and more susceptible to damage during the fossilization process, leading to a higher likelihood of the bones not being preserved in a recognizable or identifiable form. 2. Lower likelihood of discovery: If the bones are not fully fossilized, they may not be as identifiable or recognizable during excavation and erosion processes. This makes it more difficult for researchers and paleontologists to find and study these fossils, ultimately reducing the amount of information available about the organism and its history. To summarize, the direct impact of less protein being replaced with minerals during the fossilization process can decrease the likelihood of successful fossil formation and discovery. It directly affects a step in the process that is crucial for the creation and preservation of a fossil, ultimately leading to potential limitations in our understanding of extinct organisms and their environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Article: Demonstrators hold a placard, which reads, ''Homs, how small we are in front of you'', during a protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Yabroud, near Damascus, February 7, 2012. CAIRO After a bruising meeting in a five-star Cairo hotel, Arab foreign ministers led by Gulf states hinted to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that unless he halts his violent crackdown, some Arab League members might arm his opponents. The message was folded into Article 9 of a League resolution passed on Sunday that urges Arabs to \\"provide all kinds of political and material support\\" to the opposition, a phrase that includes the possibility of giving weapons to Assad's foes. Diplomats at the meeting confirmed this interpretation. Arabs are striving to unite the world around their drive to push Assad to end the killing, but have gained little traction. They had to scrap a floundering Arab monitoring mission to Syria. When they sought U.N. Security Council support for a transition plan under which Assad would step aside, Russia and China vetoed the Western-backed U.N. draft resolution. Moscow is an old ally of Syria and its top arms supplier. Sunday's Arab League meeting raised the stakes. Its implicit shuffle towards backing military resistance to Assad's forces was meant to add pressure on the Syrian leader and his Russian and Chinese allies. Yet it also risks leading to a Libya-style conflict or sectarian civil war that everyone wants to avoid. \\"It is unacceptable for Assad to practice all types of killing of civilians while we stand silent,\\" one Arab ambassador said, explaining the rationale behind the resolution that returned the Syria issue to the United Nations with a call for a joint U.N.-Arab peacekeeping force. \\"We will back the opposition financially and diplomatically in the beginning but if the killing by the regime continues, civilians must be helped to protect themselves. The resolution gives Arab states all options to protect the Syrian people,\\" the envoy said. \\"All options\\" is diplomatic language that leaves room for a military response. Two other diplomats spelled it out more explicitly, saying the resolution could allow arms transfers. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said the bloodshed was putting pressure on Arabs to act. \\"The escalation is coming from the ground and it is coming from Assad himself. This is the reason they feel they cannot stand idly by just pursuing a diplomatic track,\\" he said. \\"I suspect we will see a further militarization of this conflict, with potentially quite widespread and dangerous consequences.\\" \\"ALL KINDS OF SUPPORT\\" Smuggled guns are filtering into Syria but it is not clear if Arab or other governments are backing any such transfers. Iraqi security officials say there are signs Sunni Muslim insurgents are beginning to cross the border to join Syrian rebels. Smugglers are cashing in as prices double for weapons reaching Syria concealed in commercial traffic. For now, however, such weaponry cannot match the firepower that Assad's military can bring to bear, analysts say, but that could change if Assad fails to heed Arab peace calls. A non-Gulf Arab ambassador said Qatar and Saudi Arabia had insisted on the \\"material support\\" wording to cover \\"all kinds of support including weapons in future\\", adding: \\"But we see this as a dangerous escalation.\\" A senior Arab diplomat voiced fears that such a step could ignite a conflagration in Syria, a nation of Sunnis, Alawites, Christians, Kurds and Druze at the heart of the Arab world. \\"It is a very sensitive situation in Syria. The door is open for a lot of possibilities,\\" he said. \\"I think now Syria is at the beginning of a kind of civil war.\\" Syria's crisis has provoked a lop-sided rift among Arabs. Sunni-ruled Gulf states, broadly driven by a desire to oust Assad, an ally of their Shi'ite regional rival Iran, have the financial and political muscle to push through calls to isolate the Syrian leader. Wealthy Gulf countries, Bahrain apart, have also emerged with few scars from the wave of Arab uprisings. Egypt, Algeria and Iraq, traditionally regional heavyweights with big populations and the largest armies, may have misgivings on Syria, but have limited clout for now. Algeria registered reservations about a joint U.N.-Arab force. Others kept quiet. All three have challenges at home that blunt their ability to project their views. Iraq has its own sectarian divisions; Algeria has escaped a popular uprising, but remains wary; Egypt's generals may not like intervention in an Arab state but are preoccupied by street protests against military rule. Lebanon, long dominated by its Syrian neighbor and its own Syrian- and Iranian-backed Shi'ite armed movement, Hezbollah, was the only League member formally to object to the resolution. Highlighting the turmoil in the Arab world, Sunday's meeting in Cairo was shifted to the Marriott hotel across the Nile from the League's headquarters, located uncomfortably close to Tahrir Square, the focal point for Egyptian protesters. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, set the tone for the gathering in the plush surrounds of the former royal palace, making the case for backing the Syrian opposition. \\"NOT OPEN TO DISCUSSION\\" In a speech before closed-door talks began, he told Arab ministers: \\"At our meeting today I call for decisive measures, after the failure of the half-solutions.\\" From then on, it was clear who was in charge, according to the non-Gulf envoy, who, like others, asked not to be named. \\"These meetings were not open to discussion. The Gulf foreign ministers had positions and decisions they had reached earlier and they did not want to hear anything else,\\" he said. The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council had met separately earlier in the day. One source said their line was backed by Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia, which will host a gathering of Arab and other \\"Friends of Syria\\" on February 24. An Arab source who attended the meetings described tetchy discussions on what kind of U.N.-Arab mission the League should request from the United Nations. When a call for international \\"monitors\\" was proposed, Gulf ministers retorted that \\"what is happening in Syrian cannot be stopped without a peacekeeping force,\\" the source said. The meeting settled on requesting a \\"force\\". The source said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who was in the chair, also led calls for ending the Arab monitoring mission, which had been criticized by Syria's opposition since it began work in December and which has also faced internal dissent and logistical problems. The monitoring team was duly scrapped in the resolution. Yet prospects for securing U.N. Security Council backing for a joint peacekeeping force seem dim. Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby floated the idea last week with the U.N. secretary-general. But it received only a lukewarm response from diplomats in New York, even though the United States and others said they would consider it. \\"It really isn't realistic when there isn't a peace to keep ... This needs looking at as a future option rather than an option for now,\\" said a Western diplomat at the United Nations. \\"NO WESTERN BOOTS ON THE GROUND\\" The diplomat referred to the \\"unfortunate\\" precedent of the joint U.N.-African military force UNAMID sent to Sudan's Darfur region, which he said had lacked a clear command structure. \\"I don't see the way forward in Syria as being Western boots on the ground in any form, including in any peacekeeping form. I think they would need to come from other countries, rather than Western nations,\\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Syria would have to agree before such a force could deploy. It accepted the unarmed Arab monitors, but only after weeks of foot-dragging, and swiftly rejected Sunday's Arab resolution. The joint force request was aimed at focusing minds by \\"throwing this back to the United Nations and asking questions of Russia\\", said Shaikh of the Brookings Doha Center. \\"If this moment is lost, we may well see a continuing polarization in the international community's response and a slide into greater conflict on the ground,\\" he said. The acid test will be Russia's response, with China expected to follow Moscow's lead, analysts says. For now, Russia has said it will consider the Arab appeal but without much enthusiasm. To circumvent the Security Council, where Moscow and Beijing have twice vetoed Syria resolutions, Arabs will take their peace plan to the U.N. General Assembly, which is expected to vote on the Saudi-drafted resolution this week. Such resolutions cannot be vetoed but are non-binding. Winning U.N. support is not the only Arab challenge. Arabs have thrown their weight behind a Syrian opposition that is far from united, deterring full recognition of bodies such as the exiled Syrian National Council (SNC). \\"The main problem on the side of the Syrian opposition is that it is still scattered,\\" said the senior League diplomat. \\"They don't have a united leadership or a single voice.\\" The Arab resolution called for the opposition to \\"unify its ranks\\" and SNC members hovered around the Cairo meeting holding talks with ministers on the sidelines. Syrian officials were absent after Damascus was suspended from the 22-member League. Some Arab nations have made clear they no longer consider Assad's government legitimate. Gulf states said last week they were recalling their ambassadors from Syria and expelling Syria's envoys. Libya and Tunisia, both countries where popular revolts toppled autocratic rulers last year, have done the same. The Arab diplomat said the \\"Friends of Syria\\", a group backed by Western powers, could help \\"persuade all opposition factions from Syria, inside and outside, to be one front\\".

A young woman who fled the city, Syria’s third-largest, for Beirut spoke on Tuesday of the hellish experience that she and others had endured, trapped in their dwellings without heat while desperately awaiting breaks in the military offensive to forage for food or try to escape. The Syrian government pressed its campaign against rebellious cities across the country on Tuesday, with residents of the central city of Homs describing the renewed shelling there as particularly harsh. Activists in Homs said that during the most intense periods of shelling, starting around first light on Tuesday, rockets and tank shells whistled into the embattled Baba Amr neighborhood as often as every two minutes. “The idea of safety doesn’t exist anymore in Baba Amr,” Omar Shakir, an activist in the neighborhood reached via Skype, said as explosions erupted in the background. “Scary is all that exists.” Videos uploaded to YouTube’s syriapioneer channel showed gray and black smoke leaping high overhead as shells crashed into buildings, while the staccato outbursts of machine guns sounded incessantly. Activists described it as the heaviest shelling in five days in an assault that began on Feb. 4. The city lacks electricity and cellphone service, and land lines fade erratically. Facebook pages overflow with requests from relatives abroad asking people inside Syria to check on their loved ones. The young woman who fled, a 19-year-old student who asked not to be named because her parents were still in Homs, arrived in Beirut on Tuesday. She said that troops allowed civilians to escape on Saturday and Sunday and that people bribed soldiers to ferry them out of the Inshaat neighborhood on tanks or to clear roadways for them to drive their cars out. She described a city where “all roads were closed, and even if they weren’t, the shelling makes it impossible for you to go anywhere.” Government services have collapsed, she said, and high, stinking piles of garbage rot on many corners or emit rancid smoke — having been ignited by fighters inside the city for camouflage against government snipers. Residents have grown to fear the two main hospitals, she said, because the doctors still reporting to work tend to be government sympathizers. Some even carry guns as they make their rounds. But she detailed a kind of symbiotic cease-fire that had developed between the young army recruits deployed at some neighborhood checkpoints, the font of many defections. The soldiers get food and a certain degree of safety, while residents feel they can run short errands unmolested or occasionally escape entirely. Residents live in multiple layers of clothing and ration their use of kerosene for heat and hot water. On relatively quiet days, the food stores open, and people rush to buy canned food and flashlights. Simple things like Pepsi have become a luxury item, she said, while hallways in many homes are now stacked with bags of rice and sugar. “They are anticipating a long siege,” the student said. Civilians in the Inshaat neighborhood felt more vulnerable because there was no one to protect them, while most of the soldiers from the Free Syrian Army — the name adopted by all local militias — were in Baba Amr. A couple of neighborhoods nearby asked the antigovernment militia members not to come in at all so they could remain safe havens where the wounded, women and children could seek shelter. In Baba Amr, Mr. Shakir, the activist, estimated that 60 percent of the buildings had suffered too much damage to be habitable. The neighborhood was hit by occasional mortar shells overnight, he said, with the heavier tank and other rounds coming at daylight. “We are under full siege. It is horrible here,” Mr. Shakir said. “I have not tasted bread for the past five days.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In 2012, Arab foreign ministers led by Gulf states conveyed a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that, unless he ceases his violent crackdown, some Arab League members may arm his opponents.

Problem:story: Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its 16 constituent states. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes. First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (14171701), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and the Third Reich (1933–1945). Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany., question: What metro region is it in?

The outlines of the motifs were drawn in black while the interiors were white. In their design, they are a direct continuation of Kushite styles, with possible influences from Aksumite Ethiopia.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said.

Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

UPDATED:. 04:58 EST, 25 May 2013. Jailed: Former traffic warden Robert Ives issued bogus parking tickets to former colleagues. A corrupt traffic warden who issued nine bogus tickets against a former colleague during a ‘campaign of bullying’ has today (Fri) been jailed for six months. Robert Ives, 59, dished out the dodgy parking notices to Kevin Phillips while based at Tooting police station in south London. Ives also forged Mr Phillips’ signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public, pensioner Shamim Gilani. He was caught out after being linked to the tickets by his handwriting, Southwark Crown Court heard. On one occasion, Mr Phillips, with whom Ives had an ‘unpleasant relationship’, was given a ticket when he was parked miles away in a completely different part of south London. In a victim impact statement, Mr Phillips told how he suffered from high blood pressure and that his head had been left ‘spinning’ from the stress of disputing the tickets. Mrs Gilani, 73, said she paid the £65 fine ‘with a tear in her eye’ as she and her husband were on a tight budget. She has since been reimbursed. Ives, a Jack the Ripper enthusiast, who had been employed for the past 45 years, issued the parking notices in November 2011 - the same month he was made redundant. He has yet to find another job. Mr Phillips had left four months earlier to work as a PCSO. Ives, a father-of-one, insisted he had been ‘set up’. But a jury of four women and eight men took just 24 minutes to unanimously convict him of misconduct in a judicial or public office, after a trial at the court last month. Sentencing, Recorder Edward Cole told him: ‘Your misconduct appears to have been an unpleasant way of bullying Mr Phillips. ‘Why you picked on Mrs Gilani is not clear. ‘In the case of Mr Phillips, your misconduct amounted to a campaign of bullying. ‘Your conduct in each case was a. malicious abuse of power and a breach of trust put in you to administer. the system of parking regulation fairly and accurately. ‘Your conduct was in some ways similar those who pervert the course of justice. ‘Like all such offences, this investigation involved a waste of public resources. ‘Your behaviour involved a gross breach of trust and was persistent. ‘Public trust and confidence in those in public office is likely to be eroded by this sort of misconduct.’ Sentence: Ives was jailed for six months after a jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted him of misconduct in a judicial or public office Southwark Crown Court heard. Ives buried his head in his hands during the hearing but was stony faced as he was led out of the dock. Prosecutor Piers von Berg had earlier told the jury that Ives ‘wilfully or deliberately misconducted himself to such a degree to amount to abuse of the public trust in his office and he did so without reasonable excuse or justification.’ A handwriting expert who examined them concluded that there was a ‘strong possibility’ that they were penned by Ives and ‘certainly not by the other wardens’ at the unit, Mr von Berg added. Callous: Ives also forged his former colleague's signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public. After getting wise to Ives’ handiwork, Mr. Phillips alerted his supervisor, prompting an investigation during. which it was noted that Citroen had been spelt incorrectly as ‘Citreon’ on several of the bogus tickets. ‘Mr Phillips was asked if anyone bore a grudge against him or ill will,’ Mr von Berg added. ‘He said he had a poor relationship with Robert Ives when they worked together and police decided to question the defendant.’ Ives claimed he had not been working on the days the tickets were issued and suggested the handwriting expert could be mistaken. David Parvin, defending Ives said he continues to maintain his innocence but has acknowledged that Mr Phillips and Mrs Gilani had endured ‘a lot of stress’. ‘Mr Ives believes he and Mr Phillips shared some friendship, they had some common interests and were both fans of Neil Diamond. ‘Their relationship can be described as up and down and this was really a practical joke that went horribly wrong. ‘As time went on it got more serious and Mr Ives felt he was unable to admit it.’ Ives, who has raised money for children’s charities, is a keen member of the Whitechapel Society, dedicated to keeping the east end alive. Mr Parvin added: ‘His hobby is learning about Jack the Ripper and he has quite a collection of books.’ Ives, of Tooting, denied the charge against him. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: (CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications. The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \\"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates . Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. \\"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\\" said Munster.

Justification: The article discusses the rumors of Apple's iWatch, and describes it as not just a fancy timepiece but a wearable mobile device that could potentially change the industry by incorporating advances in mobile computing technology, serving as a real product in development.

A single cell battery contains one electrochemical cell, which consists of a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte. The chemical reactions at the electrodes create a flow of electrical charge. The single cell battery is considered the simplest type because it only involves one electrochemical cell carrying out the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy, whereas more complex batteries contain multiple cells connected together in series or parallel configurations to provide increased voltage or current capacity. In summary, I used the definition of a battery to determine that the simplest type of battery would have the least number of components and processes involved, which led me to the answer that the simplest type of battery contains a single cell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact Spanish cider is so distinct it's the butt of a joke: \\"We say, 'Oh yeah, this cider went bad, so we just put it into green bottles and called it Spanish,'\\" says cider maker Nathaniel West of Reverend Nat's Hard Cider in Portland, Ore. And yet, in perhaps the same way some people come to love the funkiest-smelling cheeses, these traditional Spanish ciders so loved in their homeland are finding a growing audience in the US. A post at eturbonews.com breaks down the differences between the Spanish cider, or sidra, and US cider. The top characteristic of sidra: Its \\"dominant wild yeast character.\\" Over the past decade, the craft cider culture has grown quickly in the US, notes NPR. This coincides with a growing sour beer market, which is helping Americans develop a taste for Spain's \\"sidra natural,\\" says Tim Prendergast, a cider maker in Washington, DC. \\"Even people who don't necessarily like sour beers now know that sourness is something that can be intentional and doesn't necessarily mean, 'Oh, this cider has gone bad,'\\" he says.

It is typically tart, flat, cloudy with sediment, and exudes a \\"funky\\" taste, which is a stark contrast to the sweeter variants that are emerging in the rapidly growing craft cider market in the United States. Spanish cider's distinctive character has led to a joke in the cider industry: \\"We say, 'Oh yeah, this cider went bad, so we just put it into green bottles and called it Spanish,'\\" as Nathaniel West of Reverend Nat's Hard Cider in Portland, Oregon humorously puts it. However, similarly to how some people develop a penchant for the most pungent cheeses, these traditional Spanish ciders are gaining popularity in the United States. The primary quality that sets sidra apart is its \\"dominant wild yeast character.\\" Over the last decade, the craft cider culture in the US has experienced rapid growth, coinciding with the burgeoning sour beer market. This development has helped Americans cultivate a taste for Spain's signature \\"sidra natural,\\" says Tim Prendergast, a cider maker in Washington, DC.

One company in Portland, called Ciders of Spain, was founded by someone who initially disliked the taste of sidra when he first tried it in Europe, but eventually fell in love with it after a few sips. He says that his experience is common, as people usually react with horror at the \\"sour, horse-blanket-smelling stuff,\\" before craving it soon after. As the craft cider market continues to grow in the US, it is likely that more consumers will develop a taste for the unique flavor profile of traditional Spanish ciders.

Input: Paula Broadwell, the author, military reservist and West Point graduate who reportedly had an extramarital affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, told an audience this summer that she routinely had access to classified information while researching a book on Petraeus's work as the commanding general in Afghanistan. During a panel discussion, Broadwell said her background in the military and her continuing obligations as a major in the Army Reserve made her particularly careful not to disclose sensitive information she was privy to while an \\"embed\\" in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011. \\"I was entrusted with this opportunity to sit in on high level meetings with General Petraeus. Sitting in on SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility] meetings in the morning, listen to classified chatter of terrorist talk and so forth. And I had that background anyhow, so I knew a lot of that information for my writing, but I knew there was a clear line that I couldn’t cross when I was writing it out,\\" Broadwell said in the July 2012 discussion at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. (Also on POLITICO: Paula Broadwell in media spotlight) Broadwell acknowledged that her connection to the military and her role as a writer sometimes caused confusion among military personnel she encountered while working on the book. \\"I was embedded with Gen. Petraeus in Afghanistan and it was a little confusing for some of the folks there because I’m also a military reservist with a top secret/SCI clearance and then some. So, a lot of my former peers didn’t know how to treat me. Was I journalist Broadwell or was I Major Broadwell?\\" she recalled. \\"I had to follow very clear lines of non-disclosure and signed non-disclosure agreements like my colleagues. I felt like I was almost held to a higher level of accountability because I could lose my clearance.\\" Broadwell's access to classified information has drawn scrutiny in the wake of reports that investigators found classified records on her computer and that a whistleblower approached House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) recently to express concern that a relationship Petraeus had may have led to classified information being compromised. The discovery of the classified information on Broadwell's computer was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The involvement of Cantor, whose staff said the information was immediately passed on to the FBI, was disclosed Saturday by the New York Times. Other news reports have also raised questions about Broadwell's access to classified information, including details related to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in September. (Also on POLITICO: Critics question Petraeus's timing) In a speech last month at the University of Denver, Broadwell said that the CIA at one point was holding prisoners at an annex near the consulate, and that the assault may have been an effort to free those prisoners. \\"I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually—had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So, that's still being vetted,\\" she said, according to a video of the Denver event posted online and first reported by the Israeli media outlet Arutz Sheva. Later in her remarks, Broadwell, said some of her information had come from a Fox News report. Fox said Monday that it's \\"original\\" Oct. 26 report did mention three Libyan militia members being turned over by the CIA to Libyan authorities. That detail does not appear in the version of the story now posted online, but Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin did include it in at least one report. \\"We're also told, those at the CIA annex took into custody three Libyan attackers and were forced to hand them over to the Libyan February 17th forces that came to help at the annex approximately 4:00 in the morning. They handed these three Libyans over. It is not clear from U.S. officials what happened to the libyans and whether those Libyan attackers were in fact released in in the end by the Libyans,\\" Griffin reported. The CIA has denied holding any prisoners at Benghazi and has vigorously disputed other aspects of Griffin's report, but it's not clear Broadwell said anything in Denver that was not previously reported by Fox. (Griffin first issued her report at about 11 A.M. Eastern Time that day. Broadwell, per a D.U. schedule, spoke after 7 P.M. Mountain Time.) At the Aspen conference in July, panel moderator Clark Bell of the McCormick Foundation said \\"certain elements\\" of Broadwell's book, \\"All In: The Education of David Petraeus,\\" underwent a pre-publication security review to scrub it of classified information. Journalists embedded with the military often have access to some classified information. The practice falls into a kind of gray area. Many embed assignments would be hard to undertake without knowing some sensitive information about tactics and upcoming operations. But, journalists don't have security clearances and are not subject to background investigations. (Also on POLITICO: 10 fast facts about Gen. Petraeus) In any event, Broadwell said she did not consider herself a journalist. In her remarks to the security professionals, journalists and government contractors at the Aspen event, she repeatedly used language that stressed how familiar she was with secret matters. During her relatively brief comments, she spoke of working for a Joint Terrorism Task Force, of her top secret clearance \\"and then some,\\" and of familiarity with \\"Five Eyes\\" efforts—lingo for U.S. Government intelligence information shared only with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom. While Broadwell stressed the access she had, she also said she was especially vigilant to not disclose any classified information because it would have been a breach of trust between her and Petraeus, whom she described as a mentor. \\"Sometimes, obviously, the government just cant disclose sources and methods and so forth,\\" she said. \\"That was just reinforced when I had access to everything, it was my responsibility not to leak it—not to violate my mentor, if you will. I was writing about a very close mentor.\\" UPDATE (Monday, 1:45 P.M.): An earlier version of this post said Fox News did not appear to have reported that prisoners were taken by the CIA in Benghazi. Fox says it did report something similar to that on Oct. 26. UPDATE (Monday, 2:02 P.M.) We've located the original Fox quote and posted it above.

You constantly ask yourself, ‘What are the notification requirements? What are the privacy issues?’ ” A close friend of the Petraeus family said Sunday that the intimate relationship between Mr. Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell, began after he retired from the military last year and about two months after he started as C.I.A. director. It ended about four months ago, said the friend, who did not want to be identified while discussing personal matters. In a letter to the C.I.A. work force on Friday, Mr. Petraeus acknowledged having the affair. Ms. Broadwell has not responded to repeated requests for comment. Under military regulations, adultery can be a crime. At the C.I.A., it can be a security issue, since it can make an intelligence officer vulnerable to blackmail, but it is not a crime. On Sunday, the same Petraeus family friend confirmed the identity of Ms. Kelley, whose complaint to the F.B.I. about “harassing” e-mails, eventually traced to Ms. Broadwell, set the initial investigation in motion several months ago. Ms. Kelley and her husband became friends with Mr. Petraeus and his wife, Holly, when Mr. Petraeus was head of the military’s Central Command, which has its headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. Ms. Kelley, who volunteers to help injured service members and military families at MacDill, has been photographed with the Petraeuses at social events in Tampa. “We and our family have been friends with General Petraeus and his family for over five years,” Ms. Kelley and her husband, Scott Kelley, said in a statement released Sunday. “We respect his and his family’s privacy, and want the same for us and our three children.” The statement did not acknowledge that it was Ms. Kelley who received the e-mails, which was first reported by The Associated Press. The involvement of the F.B.I., according to government officials, began when Ms. Kelley, alarmed by about half a dozen anonymous e-mails accusing her of inappropriate flirtatious behavior with Mr. Petraeus, complained to an F.B.I. agent who is also a personal friend. That agent, who has not been identified, helped get a preliminary inquiry started. Agents working with federal prosecutors in a local United States attorney’s office began trying to figure out whether the e-mails constituted criminal cyber-stalking. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because the sender’s account had been registered anonymously, investigators had to use forensic techniques — including a check of what other e-mail accounts had been accessed from the same computer address — to identify who was writing the e-mails. Eventually they identified Ms. Broadwell as a prime suspect and obtained access to her regular e-mail account. In its in-box, they discovered intimate and sexually explicit e-mails from another account that also was not immediately identifiable. Investigators eventually ascertained that it belonged to Mr. Petraeus and studied the possibility that someone had hacked into Mr. Petraeus’s account or was posing as him to send the explicit messages. Eventually they determined that Mr. Petraeus had indeed sent the messages to Ms. Broadwell and concluded that the two had had an affair. Then they turned their scrutiny on him, examining whether he knew about or was involved in sending the harassing e-mails to Ms. Kelley. Photo It was at that point — sometime in the late summer — that lower-level Justice Department officials notified supervisors that the case had become more complicated, and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section began working on the investigation as well. It remains unclear whether the F.B.I. also gained access to Mr. Petraeus’s personal e-mail account, or if it relied only on e-mails discovered in Ms. Broadwell’s in-box. It also remains uncertain exactly when the information about Mr. Petraeus reached Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Robert S. Mueller III , the F.B.I. director. Both men have declined to comment. But under the Attorney General Guidelines that govern domestic law enforcement officials, agents must notify F.B.I. headquarters and the Department of Justice whenever they are looking at a “sensitive investigative matter,” which includes cases “involving the activities of a domestic public official.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

F.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Broadwell for the first time the week of Oct. 21, and she acknowledged the affair, a government official briefed on the matter said. She also voluntarily gave the agency her computer. In a search, the agents discovered several classified documents, which raised the additional question of whether Mr. Petraeus had given them to her. She said that he had not. Agents interviewed Mr. Petraeus the following week. He also admitted to the affair but said he had not given any classified documents to her. The agents then interviewed Ms. Broadwell again on Friday, Nov. 2, the official said. Based on that record, law enforcement officials decided there was no evidence that Mr. Petraeus had committed any crime and tentatively ruled out charges coming out of the investigation, the official said. Because the facts had now been settled, the agency notified James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, about 5 p.m. on the following Tuesday — Election Day. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. agent who had helped get a preliminary inquiry started, and learned of Mr. Petraeus’s affair and the initial concerns about security breaches, became frustrated. Apparently unaware that those concerns were largely resolved, the agent alerted the office of Representative Eric Cantor , Republican of Virginia , the House majority leader, about the inquiry in late October. Mr. Cantor passed on the agent’s concerns to Mr. Mueller. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials said Sunday that the timing of the notifications had nothing to do with the election, noting that there was no obvious political advantage for either President Obama or Mitt Romney in the news that the C.I.A. director had had an affair; Mr. Petraeus is highly regarded by both Republicans and Democrats. They also said that Mr. Cantor’s call to the F.B.I. on Oct. 31 had not accelerated or otherwise influenced the investigation, which they said had never stalled. F.B.I. and Justice Department officials knew their handling of the case would ultimately receive immense scrutiny and took significant time to determine whom they were legally required to inform, according to a senior law enforcement official. “This was very thought-through,” the official said. The law requires that the Senate and House intelligence committees be kept “fully and currently informed” of intelligence activities, which conceivably might cover an investigation into a possible compromise of the C.I.A. director’s e-mail account and the possession of classified documents by Ms. Broadwell. But Justice Department and F.B.I. rules, designed to protect the integrity of investigations and the privacy of people who come under scrutiny, say that investigators should not share potentially damaging information about unproved allegations or private matters unless it is critical for the investigation. Glenn A. Fine , the inspector general for the Justice Department from 2000 to 2011, said it appeared that the F.B.I. was “legitimately following a lead” about possible criminal wrongdoing or a security breach. “Some have said the F.B.I. was out to get the C.I.A.,” said Mr. Fine, who is now a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP in Washington. “That might have been true 20 years ago. But it is hard to believe that is going on today.” John Prados, a historian and an author on intelligence and its abuses, said the case “posed several dilemmas for the F.B.I.” that would have prompted agents and their bosses to proceed gingerly. “Petraeus is a very important person, so they would want to be crystal clear on exactly what happened and what the implications were,” Mr. Prados said. “There was probably a sense that it had to be taken to top bureau officials. And bureau officials probably thought they had better tell the White House and Congress and the D.N.I., or they might get in trouble later,” he added, referring to the director of national intelligence. But if the security issues were resolved and no crime had been committed, Mr. Prados said, there was no justification for informing Congress or other agencies that Mr. Petraeus had had an affair.

At an Oct. 26 speech at her alma mater, the University of Denver, on the same day that Fox News reported that the rescue team at the CIA annex had been denied help, Broadwell was asked about Petraeus’ handling of the Benghazi situation. Her response was reported originally by Israel’s Arutz Sheva and Foreign Policy’s Blake Hounshell. Broadwell quoted the Fox News report when she said: “The facts that came out today were that the ground forces there at the CIA annex, which is different from the consulate, were requesting reinforcements.\\" Broadwell went on to explain more sensitive details from the Benghazi attacks, particularly concerning what the real cause might have been. “Now, I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually, um, had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So that's still being vetted.” In the original Oct. 26 Fox News report, sources at the annex said that the CIA’s Global Response Staff had handed over three Libyan militia members to the Libyan authorities who came to rescue the 30 Americans in the early hours of Sept. 12. A well-placed Washington source confirms to Fox News that there were Libyan militiamen being held at the CIA annex in Benghazi and that their presence was being looked at as a possible motive for the staged attack on the consulate and annex that night. According to multiple intelligence sources who have served in Benghazi, there were more than just Libyan militia members who were held and interrogated by CIA contractors at the CIA annex in the days prior to the attack. Other prisoners from additional countries in Africa and the Middle East were brought to this location. The Libya annex was the largest CIA station in North Africa, and two weeks prior to the attack, the CIA was preparing to shut it down. Most prisoners, according to British and American intelligence sources, had been moved two weeks earlier. The CIA, though, categorically denied these allegations, saying: “The CIA has not had detention authority since January 2009, when Executive Order 13491 was issued. Any suggestion that the agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless.” Broadwell’s affair with Petraeus was likely known to Holly Petraeus, according to family friends. The FBI reportedly knew about it months beforehand and White House Counterterrorism adviser John Brennan reportedly was aware that there was a relationship as early as the summer of 2011. The White House strongly denied that Brennan was aware so early. “It is irresponsible and flat out wrong for Fox News to run an anonymous, unsubstantiated, and blatantly false accusation, as Mr. Brennan was first made aware of the issue last Wednesday,\\" spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Broadwell, whose affair with Petraeus reportedly ended earlier this year, continued to serve as an informal spokesman for the CIA director. She suggests in her Denver speech that Petraeus knew almost immediately that the attack was a terror attack -- possibly to free militia members. A few days later, Petraeus testified in a closed session to Congress that the attack was due in large part to an anti-Islam video and a spontaneous uprising, according to reports from the hearing. Congressional leaders say privately they believe they were lied to by Petraeus when he testified shortly after the attack. Some of these members already considered charging Petraeus with perjury, but said they planned to withhold judgment until he testified this week. After resigning as CIA director, the CIA said Acting Director Mike Morrell would testify in his place. All of this raises the question: What was the CIA really doing in Benghazi in addition to searching for Qaddafi’s stash of more than 22,000 shoulder-held missiles that could bring down commercial airplanes, and who in the White House knew exactly what the CIA was up to?

Adam Housley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based senior correspondent. ||||| Output:","completion":"Task: Summarize multiple news articles about Paula Broadwell and her affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, and whether classified information was revealed.

Article:","completion":"Title: 6 Effective Steps to Safely Remove a Splinter Introduction: A splinter can be a painful and annoying occurrence, often happening when you least expect it. Removing a splinter can be tricky, as an improper extraction could lead to infection or further injury. In this article, we will examine six effective steps to safely remove a splinter with minimal discomfort. Step 1: Examine the Splinter Before attempting to remove the splinter, get a good look at it. Determine its size, depth, and angle of penetration. Minor splinters can often be removed with simple techniques, while larger, deeper ones may require more advanced methods. If the splinter is embedded too deep or if you feel unsure about removing it, consult a healthcare professional. Always clean the affected area with soap and water before attempting any removal techniques. Step 2: Use Tape to Gently Pull the Splinter Out For smaller, superficial splinters, using normal adhesive tape can help pull the splinter out with ease. Cut a small piece of tape and place it over the splinter. Press down gently, ensuring the tape adheres firmly to the surrounding skin. Then, carefully peel the tape off in the direction opposite to the angle of the splinter. This method is particularly useful for tiny, hair-like splinters that are difficult to grasp. Step 3: Try Using Glue to Get the Splinter Out Similar to the tape method, using glue is another gentle approach to splinter removal. Apply a thin layer of non-toxic glue, such as white school glue, over the splinter. Allow the glue to dry completely, which usually takes about 30 minutes. Once it's dry, peel the glue off slowly in the opposite direction of the splinter. The glue should adhere to the splinter, effectively pulling it out of the skin. Step 4: Apply Baking Soda to Get the Splinter Out For stubborn or deeper splinters, a baking soda paste can help coax the splinter closer to the surface. Mix a small amount of baking soda with water to create a thick paste. Apply the paste to the affected area, covering the splinter completely. Secure the paste with a bandage and let it sit for at least 1 hour, or even overnight. The baking soda solution may cause the splinter to move closer to the surface, making it easier to remove with tweezers or other methods. Step 5: Use Ichthammol Ointment to Remove the Splinter Ichthammol ointment, sometimes known as black drawing salve, can be found at most pharmacies and is designed to help draw out foreign objects lodged in the skin. To use, apply a generous amount of the ointment on the splinter and cover it with a bandage. Check the splinter after a few hours to see if it's close enough to the surface for removal. This method may take longer compared to others, but it's painless and effective in drawing out stubborn splinters. Step 6: Apply Epsom Salt to the Splinter Another effective method of drawing out a splinter is using Epsom salts. Soak a small cloth or cotton ball in warm water mixed with Epsom salts. Apply it to the splinter area and hold it in place with a bandage or tape for about 30 minutes. The Epsom salt solution may help to bring the splinter closer to the surface, making it easier to extract. Conclusion: Dealing with splinters can be a frustrating experience, but with these six effective methods at your disposal, you can safely and effectively remove most splinters with minimal pain. Always remember to thoroughly clean the affected area after removal to prevent infection and consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about the splinter's depth or if an infection develops."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

They died of infectious diseases and childbirth in medieval Edinburgh, some 600 years ago. But now some of the skeletons of almost 400 men, women and children, whose remains were unearthed in a cemetery five years ago, have been brought back to life thanks to digital faces created by forensic artists. By examining the remains, experts from the University of Dundee have revealed how the individuals lived and died, as well as what some of them would have looked like. Experts from the University of Dundee have reconstructed the faces of Medieval Scots living in Edinburgh and Leith using chemical analysis and cutting edge computer equipment. This boy was aged between 13 and 17 when he died and could have been a patient at a medieval hospital. They are based on the remains of medieval Scots unearthed in a Leith cemetery five years ago. A forensic pathology report was done on all of the remains, allowing scientists to gain information about the population. Strontium and Isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild the people’s faces. The graves of 390 people were discovered in the grounds of South Leith Parish Church in 2009, when work was underway for Edinburgh’s new tramline. They date from between the 15th and the 18th century and were found beneath Constitution Street. It has taken scientists five years to put a face to some of the medieval Scots. Archaeologist John Lawson told Edinburgh Evening News: ‘We have had a forensic pathology report done on all of the remains and that is allowing us to gain information about the population.’ Among the skeletons was one of a boy who died aged between 13 and 17 in around 1400. The date of his death indicates that he could have been a patient at a medieval hospital on the site, or one of the first burials associated with Leith Parish Church, Culture 24 reported. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild the people's faces. This is the face of a a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child.

The face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid-16th and mid-17th century was also reconstructed. Strontium and Isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild three of the people’s faces, which look strikingly modern. The face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid 16th and mid 17th century was also reconstructed (pictured) Forensic artist Paloma Joana Galzi was involved in the project. She specialises in facial recognition and reconstruction, post-mortem sketches and studied Forensic Arts in Scotland, which is the only place in the world to offer this specific qualification and training. Together with other experts, she reconstructed the face of a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child. It is likely that she was a victim of a disease that swept the city and was 1.5 inches shorter than the average woman of the time, at 4ft 11 inches. Mr Lawson explained that most of the dead would have been victims of disease and some women would have died in childbirth. Around 90 per cent of the medieval population died before they were 45. Dr Kate Britton, of Aberdeen University, who was also involved in the project, said chemical analysis shows that four in five of the victims were local to Leith or Edinburgh and ate a diet mostly made up of dairy and meat. Mr Lawson told STV: ‘The results have shed new light on the lives of the medieval population in one of Scotland's largest and most important ports.’ ‘It has allowed us to highlight the lives of the ordinary person in Leith, by putting a face to these individuals and showing how they lived and died.’ Edinburgh's Old Town and Leith both have Medieval buildings, including parts of the famous castle which was a residence at the time.

We will learn three important things: Sight, Storing, and Disguise. Are you ready? Let's start! 1. Sight - Always Keep an Eye on Your Stuff Imagine you go to the playground or the park with your toys, like your favorite stuffed animal or a ball. You want to make sure that you can always see your things, so they won't get lost or taken by someone else accidentally. Keep them close to you, or ask an adult, like your mom or dad, to watch them when you're playing with your friends. By always keeping an eye on your things, they will stay safe. 2. Storing - Finding a Perfect Home for Your Belongings Do you have a special place for your toys, books, or clothes, like a toy box, a bookshelf, or a closet? These are perfect spots for keeping your things safe when you're not using them. Make sure to put your things away properly when you're done playing or wearing them. It also helps keep your room nice and tidy. If you're going somewhere, ask your parents to help you pack a bag. That way, your belongings stay together and won't get lost. 3. Disguise - Cleverly Hiding Your Things Sometimes, it's fun to hide stuff, like when we play hide-and-seek, right? Well, if there's something very special or valuable, like an important toy or a special piece of clothing, and you don't want anyone to take it or accidentally play with it, hiding it can be a smart idea. For example, you can put a favorite toy in a box that looks like it's for something else. That way, no one would know it's in there! Just make sure not to forget where you hid it. You could also ask a grown-up to help you find great hiding places. So now you know three awesome ways to keep your things safe and sound! Remember to always watch your things (Sight), put them in a special place (Storing), and sometimes maybe even hide them (Disguise). Have fun keeping your belongings safe and sound, and don't forget to ask your parents or other grown-ups for help if you need it!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Santana Gives Bullpen Day Off Santana said he would not let that frustrate him — “I don’t go by emotions; I don’t go by comments or criticism,” he said after Sunday’s game. But Sunday, Manuel said, Santana left no question over who would pitch the ninth. “He was very adamant about that,” Manuel said. “He wanted a complete game.” The Mets rebounded from their 14-inning loss the night before with an all-around performance. The offense pounded out 17 hits, including three home runs, to provide the support that has so often been lacking for Santana this season. And Carlos Beltrán provided the highlight on defense, reaching over the center-field wall to at least temporarily preserve Santana’s shutout. Santana scattered six hits and one walk, and notched five strikeouts. He needed 118 pitches, 81 for strikes. At first, when Manuel was asked about the pitch count he had set, he joked, “About 180.” “Actually, my number was 115,” Manuel said. “But when he had the two outs, I figured I’d let him go ahead. I didn’t think it would kill him.” And if his performance over all was spectacular, his first five innings were nothing short of impeccable. Until the sixth, he allowed two base runners, tying up batter after batter with his changeup sprinkled between fastballs. The Mets had given Santana three runs to work with, but it was more than enough until their offensive explosion. With a 3-0 lead, the Mets batted around in the sixth, spraying eight consecutive hits. Fernando Tatis, who went 3 for 4, and Ramón Castro each hit two-run homers over the left-field fence on either side of a St. Louis pitching change. Cardinals starter Kyle Lohse was pounded for 11 hits and 7 runs, then Randy Flores allowed four hits in his inning. “It really pumps you up, and you want to be the same way,” Santana said. “And that’s what I was doing, trying to help, trying to win this game.” He chipped in at the plate, going 2 for 4 with his fourth career run batted in, but not everything went smoothly. In the sixth, Santana dawdled outside the batter’s box watching his 300-foot line drive to right field. His bat was still in his hand as he glanced past his right shoulder, convinced that the ball was going foul. He started running only when it hit the base of the right-field fence. “It was terrible running from me,” he said. “I’ve never been in that situation before.” When Santana returned to the mound in the seventh, he was a little shakier, and it took Beltrán’s spectacular grab of a blast by Ryan Ludwick to keep the Cardinals scoreless. “As soon as I jumped for the ball, I felt the ball hit the tip of my glove, but I didn’t know until I pulled the glove back,” Beltrán said. Two pitches later, though, there was no highlight-reel catch as Albert Pujols slammed a pitch into the left-field bleachers. With the Cardinals trailing by eight runs, Pujols’s homer did far less damage than his previous one, which broke a tie in the 14th inning Saturday night. Santana’s spot in the batting order came up in the bottom half of the inning, and Manuel let him stay in. Determined to see out his ninth win of the season, Santana banged out his second base hit on a day that, no matter what, the Mets would finish in first place thanks to their first complete game since Oliver Pérez threw one in September 2006. “I think it was the right time to do something like that,” Santana said. Brandon Knight was designated for assignment Sunday morning after his only start for the Mets. He allowed four runs in five innings against the Cardinals on Saturday. The Mets called up the left-handed reliever Willie Collazo to replace him because, Jerry Manuel said, they needed a fresh arm in the bullpen after it pitched nine innings on Saturday. ... Manuel is hoping that Pedro Martínez, who is in the Dominican Republic mourning the death of his father, will be able to start on Friday in Houston. ... Outfielder Ryan Church, who is still recovering from postconcussion syndrome and migraines, performed his third day of light physical activity. He will travel with the team to Florida and if all goes well, Manuel said, will remain there to begin a rehabilitation assignment with Class A St. Lucie. Manuel also said Church could return in the Mets’ next homestand, which starts Aug. 5 against San Diego.

It is made of a small narrow peninsula sticking out from Guangdong province. The total area of Macao is about 21.45 square kilometers, and it is made up of three parts: Macao Peninsula, Dingbat Isle and Lehman Isle. Between Macao Peninsula and Dingbat Isle there are two bridges which join the two parts together, and there is also a highway between the Dingbat and Lehman Isles.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What part of the constitution are affirmative action programs based in?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well.

Information: - Alvan Fisher ( August 9 , 1792 -- February 13 , 1863 ) was one of the United States 's pioneers in landscape painting and genre works . - Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, is the depiction in art of landscapes natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth. What entity does 'alvan fisher' has the relation 'field of work' with?

Premise: \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The grounds close at midnight every night.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight\\" is true, it means that during a full moon, the grounds remain accessible to the public until midnight. However, this statement does not provide information about the grounds' operational hours during the rest of the nights when there is no full moon. In order to assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"The grounds close at midnight every night,\\" we must first look at the structure of the two statements: 1. Premise: \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight.\\" 2. Hypothesis: \\"The grounds close at midnight every night.\\" The premise establishes a specific condition involving full moons, which only occur on a limited number of days throughout the year. As such, the premise only provides information about operational hours during those particular days (i.e., nights with a full moon). On the other hand, the hypothesis deals with general operational hours and pertains to every night, regardless of the moon's phase. As a result, the hypothesis is more far-reaching in scope compared to the premise. Now, let's look into whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also necessarily be true. In this case, if the grounds stay open till midnight when there is a full moon, does it logically follow that the grounds close at midnight every night? The simple answer is no. While the premise suggests that the grounds remain open until midnight on full moon nights, it does not provide any information on the closing time during other nights when there is no full moon. That means it is still possible for the grounds to close earlier or even later on non-full moon nights. For example, the operational hours could be different during nights with other moon phases, such as crescents or half moons. Alternatively, the grounds might have different closing times depending on the days of the week, seasons, or other external factors. In conclusion, the premise \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"The grounds close at midnight every night.\\" Although the premise and the hypothesis share the concept of the grounds closing at midnight, the premise is limited in scope, addressing only the nights with a full moon. Consequently, we cannot infer from the premise alone that the grounds, without exception, close at midnight every night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Now, I have a new situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Answer this question please: Which lake will have more algae? A:","completion":"A: Based on the provided background information, it is highly likely that Lake Mahoe will have more algae. This is because the lake is situated right next to a large farm that grows various crops for the town. The farm likely uses fertilizers and pesticides to aid in crop growth and protect against pests. When rainwater falls on the farm, it can pick up these chemicals, and runoff can then carry them into Lake Mahoe. The dissolved fertilizers in the lake can lead to an excessive growth of water plants and algae. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, and there is no mention of nearby farming activities or the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Therefore, the risk of fertilizer-induced algae growth is significantly lower in Lake Tresco as compared to Lake Mahoe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period.

Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989. - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - The Eastern Bloc was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe. - The Soviet Occupation Zone (\\"Sovetskaya okkupatsionnaya zona Germanii\\", \\"Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany\\") was the area of central Germany occupied by the Soviet Union from 1945 on, at the end of World War II. On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which became commonly referred to as East Germany, was established in the Soviet Occupation Zone. - The Oder (Czech, Lower Sorbian and , Upper Sorbian: \\"Wódra\\") is a river in Central Europe. It rises in the Czech Republic and flows (generally north- and northwest-ward) through western Poland, later forming of the border between Poland and Germany, part of the OderNeisse line. The river ultimately flows into the Szczecin Lagoon north of Szczecin and then into three branches (the Dziwna, wina and Peene) that empty into the Gulf of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea. - Dieter Zechlin ( October 30 , 1926 -- March 16 , 2012 ) was a German pianist . He was one of East Germany 's most prominent pianists throughout the 1950 - 80s . In 1959 he received the Art Prize of the GDR and in 1961 the National Prize of the GDR . Zechlin was born in Goslar . He was married to the composer Ruth Zechlin , and was later married to the pianist , Susanne Grützmann . He died , aged 85 , in Potsdam . - The Potsdam Agreement was the agreement between three of the Allies of World War II, United Kingdom, United States, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for the military occupation and reconstruction of Germanyreferring to the German Reich with its pre-war 1937 borders including the former eastern territoriesand the entire European theatre of War territory. It also included Germany's demilitarisation, reparations and the prosecution of war criminals. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. - Potsdam is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital Berlin and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel, southwest of Berlin's city center. - The OderNeisse line is the international border between Germany and Poland. It was drawn at the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of the Second World War and is primarily delineated along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers in Central Europe, meeting the Baltic Sea to the north, just west of the Polish seaports of Szczecin and winoujcie (German: \\"Stettin\\" and \\"Swinemünde\\"). All prewar German territory east of the line and within the 1937 German boundaries (23.8% of the former Weimar Republic) were placed under International Law Administrative status, with most of it being made part of newly-Communist Poland. The small remainder, consisting of the territory surrounding the German city of Königsberg (now renamed Kaliningrad, in honour of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin) in northern East Prussia, was allocated to the Soviet Union (as Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR, today the Russian Federation) after the war (pending the final World War II peace treaty for Germany). The vast majority of the native German population in these territories fled, or was killed or expelled by force. The OderNeisse line marked the border between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland from 1950 to 1990. East Germany confirmed the border with Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, finally accepted the border (with reservations) in 1970. In 1990 the newly reunified Germany and the Republic of Poland signed a treaty recognizing it as their border.

Step 2: Establish character's action Angela is reaching for her phone to find the information she's looking for. Step 3: Describe setting/environment I need to make sure the reader can visualize the scene by adding some details about the setting. Since the characters are talking about medicine, they might be at a pharmacy or at home discussing it. Carrie noticed the puzzled look on Angela's face and decided to offer her assistance. They were standing in the aisle of the local pharmacy, surrounded by shelves filled with countless bottles and boxes of various remedies. Step 4: Introduce a potential obstacle To create conflict in the story, I can introduce an obstacle that makes it difficult for Angela to find the information she needs. Angela scrolled through her messages, but alas, she couldn't find the text from the doctor. She sighed, placing her phone back into her pocket. \\"I must have accidentally deleted it,\\" she said, her voice filled with disappointment.

Angela thought for a moment, then responded, \\"It was over-the-counter, and the doctor said it was specifically for my symptoms. Fever, sore throat, and cough.\\" Step 7: Resolution and character growth Now that I've built up a conflict, I need to present a solution and demonstrate how the characters grow from the experience. Carrie nodded, her eyes scanning the shelves nearby. She picked up a box that promised relief for all the symptoms Angela had mentioned. \\"How about this one? It seems to cover everything your doctor mentioned,\\" Carrie suggested, handing the box to Angela. Angela examined the box, her face brightening with hope. \\"Yes, this looks like it should do the trick,\\" she agreed, relief evident in her voice. Step 8: End the story with a sense of closure As the story comes to a close, I want to make sure the reader feels a sense of resolution. Together, they made their way to the checkout counter, grateful for their teamwork.

Since we have -82*t and -39*t on the left side of the equation, we can combine these terms by adding their coefficients. -82*t + (-39)*t = (-82 - 39) * t = -121 * t Now, the equation becomes: -121*t - 792 = -49*t We want to isolate the variable t. To do this, we will add 121*t to both sides of the equation to eliminate the t term from the left side: -121*t + 121*t - 792 = -49*t + 121*t This simplifies to: -792 = 72*t Next, we will solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 72: -792 / 72 = 72 * t / 72 -11 = t So, the solution to the equation -82*t - 39*t - 792 = -49*t is t = -11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"When did the tethys seaway shrink?\\" Context: \\"During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent, the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula. India continued to collide with Asia. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma (ICS 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Tethys Seaway, an ancient seaway that existed between the continents of Gondwana and Laurasia during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras, gradually shrank over time due to the movement of tectonic plates and the ongoing process of continental drift. This seaway reached its ultimate shrinking and disappearance during the Miocene Epoch, a period that lasted from approximately 23 to 5.3 million years ago. The question of when exactly the Tethys Seaway shrank can be traced within the context provided, which states that the extinction of the seaway occurred as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 million years ago (Ma), according to the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) 2004. This collision was facilitated by the continuous movement of continents, ultimately leading to their current positions. As the African and Eurasian plates collided, the Tethys Seaway became more constrained, ultimately disappearing entirely. This geological event coincided with other significant changes in the Earth's landscape during the Miocene. For example, the Andes mountain range rose as a result of the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America, and the Meso-American peninsula extended southwards. Simultaneously, the ongoing collision between India and Asia produced the Himalayan mountain range, further altering the planet's geography. In addition to the shrinking of the Tethys Seaway, the Miocene witnessed substantial shifts in the marine environment. The temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea, known as the Messinian salinity crisis, occurred near the end of the Miocene epoch. This event was brought about by a combination of uplifts in the western Mediterranean region's mountains and a global decline in sea levels. Consequently, extensive evaporite deposits (salt layers) were formed, evidencing the drastic reduction in water content within the Mediterranean Basin. In conclusion, the Tethys Seaway shrank and eventually disappeared during the Miocene Epoch, due to the collision of Africa and Eurasia between 19 and 12 million years ago. This geological transformation was accompanied by other significant changes in the Earth's landscape and marine environments, such as the formation of new mountain ranges and the temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 2: How many joules are required to break the london dispersion force in between two hydrogen molecules? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hello little buddy! Let me explain these questions to you. Question 1: To identify primary (stronger) and secondary (weaker) intermolecular forces between molecules, we need to look at the types of forces and the molecules involved. There are three main types of intermolecular forces: 1. Ionic bonds: These happen between positively and negatively charged atoms. They are really strong. 2. Hydrogen bonds: These happen between hydrogen and very electronegative atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine. They are not as strong as ionic bonds, but still quite strong. 3. Van der Waals forces: These happen between all molecules, no matter the charge, and are the weakest of these forces. London Dispersion forces are a type of van der Waals force. To identify primary and secondary forces between molecules, first, look at the charges of the atoms. If they are charged, ionic bonds are probably the primary force. If you see hydrogen connected to oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine, hydrogen bonds might be the primary force. If none of these are present, London Dispersion forces are the primary intermolecular force. Question 2: The number of joules required to break London Dispersion forces between two hydrogen molecules would depend on many factors, like temperature, the distance between the molecules, and other environmental conditions. So, it's hard to give an exact number. These two questions are not the same, but they are related. The first question helps you understand and identify different types of intermolecular forces. The second question is about the energy needed to break a specific type of force, the London Dispersion force between two hydrogen molecules. I hope this helps, my little friend!

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used a Pepper's ghost illusion? from the following article ? Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation? ? In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

Fish oils could hold the key to saving pensioners’ sight. Omega-3 fatty acids, abundant in oily fish, help stop tiny blood vessels from bleeding into the back of the eye, experiments show. The finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight, including many cases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in the elderly. The finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight (File photo) AMD affects more than 600,000 Britons and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages. There are few treatments – and no cure – for the condition. The research, from Harvard Medical School, focused on ‘wet AMD’, the most serious form, in which central vision can be lost within months. In the study, a diet rich in omega-3 cut damage to the blood vessels in mice with an AMD-like eye disease. The healthy fats, which are found in mackerel, trout, herring, sardines, tuna and salmon, stopped damaging immune cells from fuelling the disease, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Researcher Dr Kip Connor said the fats seems to have a ‘vital role’ in eye health. It is not clear if fish oil supplements alone will be enough help save sight in people. This is because the body may find it harder to process and make use of omega-3 as we age. AMD affects more than 600,000 Britons and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages. There are few treatments ¿ and no cure ¿ for the condition. However, the findings do point to a drug related to fish oil. With existing drugs expensive, injected directly into the eye and not effective in all cases, the researchers said that there is an urgent need for new treatments. Dr Connor said that given the prevalence of AMD and a related form of blindness in diabetics, the ‘potential impact of this study is highly significant’. Patients with other diseases fed by rogue blood vessels, such as cancer, may also benefit from the knowledge. Dr Connor added: ‘It is our hope that future studies will allow us to develop specific therapeutics that harness this knowledge, resulting in greater visual outcome and quality of life for patients suffering from these sight-threatening diseases.’ In the meantime, he advises that everyone eat oily fish or take omega-3 supplements for all-round health.

AMD currently affects over 600,000 Britons, and this number is expected to triple in the next 25 years due to an aging population. 4. A study from Harvard Medical School found that a diet rich in omega-3 reduced damage to blood vessels in mice with an AMD-like eye disease. 5. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish like mackerel, trout, herring, sardines, tuna, and salmon, stopped damaging immune cells from fueling the disease. 6. Researcher Dr. Kip Connor suggests omega-3 plays a vital role in eye health, but it is still unclear if fish oil supplements alone can help save human sight. 7. The study's findings point to the potential for a drug related to fish oil in treating AMD and other diseases fed by rogue blood vessels. 8. Dr. Connor recommends eating oily fish or taking omega-3 supplements for overall health benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of? ? Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first...

Or an overhaul of the tax system could take much longer than anticipated. The last major tax changes, in the 1980s, took more than two years to enact. ||||| Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is changing his tune on how soon Congress might be able to pass a tax reform package. In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Mnuchin said that his original prediction that lawmakers would get tax reform to President Trump’s desk by August was “highly aggressive to not realistic at this point.” “It started as [an] aggressive timeline,” he told FT. “It is fair to say it is probably delayed a bit because of the healthcare.” Mnuchin still expressed confidence that Congress would be able to overhaul the tax system this year. In February, he had predicted that lawmakers would pass tax reform before they leave on their annual summer recess in August. His February comments came in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, and he conceded at the time, “That’s an ambitious timeline. It could slip to later in the year.” Last month Republicans failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare because House GOP leaders failed to secure enough votes in the lower chamber to pass the bill. Afterward, Republicans said they were eyeing tax reform as the next major item on their agenda and planning to use the budget reconciliation process to push it through the House and Senate. The obscure budget procedure allows the Senate to pass certain legislation with a simple majority and not a supermajority of 60 senators. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The possibility of tax reform efforts failing or taking longer than anticipated is a concern, as seen with the attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has acknowledged that his initial prediction of tax reform being passed before the congressional August recess was too optimistic. Mnuchin explained that the delay is in part due to the healthcare situation and expressed hope that the tax system overhaul will still be completed this year. The last major tax changes in the 1980s took over two years to implement, which could potentially mean that the tax reform process may face a lengthy timeline. Following the failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, Republicans shifted their priority to focusing on tax reform, with plans to use the budget reconciliation process to navigate the bill through the House and Senate. The reconciliation process enables the Senate to pass specific legislation with a simple majority rather than a supermajority of 60 senators. However, this increased focus on tax reform does not guarantee a timely resolution, as numerous factors can cause delays or failures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. He hands me a glass of the pink, frothing juice, cooled with flakes he carved off a big block of ice, smiles and refuses to take any money. A muezzin with a lilting, haunting tone calls the faithful to prayer, and his voice merges with salvoes of artillery fire echoing around the city walls. Men and women, even children, are so used to the sound of shelling that they stopped flinching at the noise a long time ago. At any rate, they do in Damascus proper, which is controlled by the regime. This weekend, children, watched by parents on sun beds, splashed around in the pool of the hotel used by the United Nations relief staff and by foreign correspondents. None of the families even looked up every time one of the government batteries, not far away, boomed like a demented bass drum. The vast majority of the shellfire is going out from the regime's positions. The rebels, much better armed now, fire some mortars back, which can be deadly, but have a shorter range than the Syrian army's artillery. It is very different in the outer suburbs, held by the rebels, which are the targets of the shelling. Among them are the places hit by the chemical weapons attack. On previous trips to Damascus, I have been to some of them, so battered now by war that almost no building is undamaged, and some streets are impassable because of the rubble. No-one goes to the swimming pool there. Most of the civilians have left, becoming part of the more than four million people displaced within Syria, or the two million plus who have fled the country to become refugees. Outside the Umayyad mosque, a young man called Walid, his hair slicked back with wet-look gel, stops on his way to prayer. Like many people in Damascus at the end of the week, he has been following the G-20 conference in St Petersburg on television. \\"Yes, I know the American president wants to bomb us, but we're too strong, because we're backed by the Chinese and the Russians. And we're united behind President [Bashar al-]Assad.\\" A Muslim cleric visiting from Lebanon, Sheikh Abdul Salim al-Harash, says he is glad the Americans no longer have it all their own way. \\"These days, other countries like Russia, South Africa and India can take decisions, and they're against military action.\\" The fact is though that Syria is still waiting for the results of decisions made elsewhere, most critically in Washington DC. A week ago, when it looked as if US President Barack Obama was on the point of ordering an attack, government-controlled Damascus was tense and unhappy. I saw what that meant at a bakery. Syrians love their fragrant, steaming piles of flat bread, and thanks to government subsidies each piece costs less than Â£0.10 (0.16) at state-owned bakeries. Unruly queues were spilling out of the bakery and down the street. Young men and boys were climbing in over its steel barred gates to outflank the women and older men who were trying to push their way up the steps to the bread window. A middle-aged woman in a headscarf and dressed in a black abaya had tears of anger and frustration rolling down her face after she was jostled out of the bread line. She pointed at men emerging with big piles of bread. The woman, who did not want to give her name, said they were black marketeers who resold the bread for two or three times the price. The mood lifted once President Obama ordered the vote in the US Congress on military action. Now though, the edgy nervousness is coming back as the vote approaches. Once again, Damascenes are asking whether a toxic cloud might poison them if an American missile hits a chemical weapons site, or whether the armed rebels in the suburbs would use an American attack to try to push closer to the regime's centres of power. Sources: CSIS, RUSI Syria chemical attacks: What we know Syria's chemical weapons stockpile Q&A: Threatened strike on Syria Syria crisis: Western military options Syria's options in case of US strike One Syrian, well connected to the regime, asked me what it was like to be in a city bombed by American cruise missiles. I told him what I had seen in Baghdad, Iraq, and Tripoli, Libya, which was that the missiles were accurate and powerful, and the explosions would be louder than the worst thunderclaps he had ever heard. The important thing, I told him, was to stay clear of likely targets, places like military bases and key regime buildings. Whichever way the US Congress votes, the war in Syria is entering a new phase. Jihadists, allied or affiliated with al-Qaeda, are increasingly prominent among the armed rebels. But more than ever, Syria has become a proxy war, a boxing ring with no rules in which regional powers use Syrians to fight their battles. The most significant is between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who compete for influence from Lebanon down to the Gulf. The Saudis back the insurrection, Iran is the Assad regime's closest strategic partner. But to add another layer of trouble, the President of the United States wants to mount an attack on the regime. Mr Obama will not say publicly whether he will go ahead with the attack, using his presidential prerogatives, if he loses the vote. Even if he accepts a veto from Congress, it will not mean an end to American involvement. He will still work to punish the regime for what he says was an unforgiveable crime, which President Assad's men say was carried out by the rebels. Damascus is an ancient city that has seen generations of wars. Mark Twain wrote that in Damascus, years were only moments. Time, he said, was measured by the empires the city has seen rise and fall. President Assad must be hoping that this crisis will be a way station in America's decline in the Middle East. President Obama believes that action is necessary or others will dare to call the bluff of the most powerful nation on earth. Every house and block of flats in Damascus bristles with TV satellite dishes. Official Syrian television serves up nationalistic homages to the bravery of the armed forces. But plenty of the TVs in Damascus in the next week will be tuned to international news channels as Syrians follow the debate in Washington, and try to assess exactly what the man in the Oval Office might send their way.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To determine if you need gas in your car, there are several methods that can be employed. I will discuss these methods as well as their relative levels of reasonableness. 1. Check the fuel gauge: The most reasonable and accurate method for assessing if you need gas in your car is to check the fuel gauge on the instrument cluster. The fuel gauge typically consists of an analog dial or an electronic display that indicates the current fuel level in the gas tank. This method is both precise and straightforward, as it provides real-time information on the car's fuel level. When the fuel gauge reading moves towards the low fuel level warning (often labeled as E or a red zone), it signifies that you need to refill the gas. 2. Calculate distance and fuel consumption manually: Another way to determine if you need gas in your car is by manually calculating the distance traveled and the car's fuel consumption. Most cars have trip meters that help track the distance covered. Note the distance at the last fill-up and research the estimated fuel efficiency of your car (usually measured in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter). Divide the distance traveled since the last fill up with the estimated fuel efficiency to find out how much gas you have consumed. This method is less reasonable due to the potential for human errors and inaccuracies when estimating fuel efficiency. 3. Keep track of your driving habits: While not as accurate as the other methods, monitoring your driving habits, such as aggressive acceleration, prolonged idling, or frequent braking, can help assess your fuel consumption indirectly. These factors often reduce fuel efficiency, leading to a quicker need for gas. Although this method is less reasonable for determining the exact fuel level, it can provide a general idea of when you might need to refill your gas tank. 4. Rely on low fuel warning lights or notifications: Modern cars often have low fuel warning lights or notifications that alert the driver when the fuel level is low. This is a reasonably accurate method of determining if you need gas in your car. However, relying solely on this may cause you to wait until the last minute to fill up, potentially risking running out of fuel. In conclusion, among these methods, the most reasonable for accomplishing the goal of determining if you need gas in your car is to check the fuel gauge on the instrument cluster. This method provides real-time, accurate information about the fuel level, enabling you to make informed decisions about when to refill your gas tank. While the other methods can provide supplementary information and insight, the fuel gauge is the most precise and convenient indicator of fuel levels in your car."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements. Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight, which he refers to as \\"Mrs. Jones\\".

Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Metafont is a description language used to define vector fonts. It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. PostScript. Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as a counterpart to his TeX typesetting system. - LaTeX (, also pronounced as , a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to formatted text, as in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italic), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX. - WYSIWYG is an acronym for \\"what you see is what you get\\". In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. - BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references . The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system . Within the typesetting system , its name is styled as ( mathrm ( B ( scriptstyle ( IB ) ) ! T ! -- ( displaystyle E ) ! X ) ) . The name is a portmanteau of the abbreviation of \`\` bibliography '' and TeX . BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner , by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information , similarly to the separation of content and presentation / style supported by LaTeX itself . - TeX (or , see below) is a typesetting system (or \\"formatting system\\") designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. Together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time. TeX is free software, which has made it more accessible to a wider range of users. - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. - Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting program TeX. It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992. Computer Modern, or variants of it, remains very widely used in scientific publishing, especially in disciplines that make frequent use of mathematical notation. - TeX Live is a free software distribution for the TeX typesetting system that includes major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts. It is the replacement of its no-longer supported counterpart teTeX. It is now the default TeX distribution for several Linux distributions such as openSUSE, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo. Other Unix operating systems like OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD have also converted from teTeX to TeX Live. - MiKTeX is a distribution of the TeX/LaTeX typesetting system for Microsoft Windows. It also contains a set of related programs. MiKTeX provides the tools necessary to prepare documents using the TeX/LaTeX markup language, as well as a simple tex editor: TeXworks. The name comes from Christian Schenk's login: MiK for Micro-Kid. What is the relationship between 'bibtex' and 'web'? A:","completion":"The relationship between BibTeX and the web lies in the way BibTeX is used for managing and formatting references for documents, which can also include web-based sources. While BibTeX is primarily used in conjunction with LaTeX for creating documents, it can also be utilized for handling references for web-based content. BibTeX allows users to store information about various types of references, such as books, articles, and electronic sources, including web pages. When a user wants to cite a web-based source, they can create a BibTeX entry containing the relevant information about the source, such as the author, title, URL, and access date. This entry is then stored in a .bib file, which can be used for reference management in the LaTeX document. During document preparation, the user can cite the web-based source using a specific citation command that refers to the BibTeX entry. The LaTeX document can then be compiled along with the .bib file, and BibTeX will automatically format the citation and bibliographical entry according to the chosen citation style. In summary, the relationship between BibTeX and the web is that BibTeX serves as a tool to manage and format references, including those from web-based sources, for documents created using the LaTeX system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month. Sasha Fierce was created during the making of what song?","completion":"Sasha Fierce, the alter ego of Beyoncé, was created during the making of the song \\"Crazy in Love.\\" This persona was used as a means to separate her stage performance persona, characterized as aggressive, strong, sassy, and sexy, from her real-life personality. The genesis of Sasha Fierce occurred during the creative process and performance dynamics for \\"Crazy in Love,\\" which allowed Beyoncé to tap into a more assertive, bold, and provocative character. The world was formally introduced to Sasha Fierce with the 2008 release of Beyoncé's album \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce.\\" This alter ego provided a creative expression for Beyoncé to extend her range as an artist, offering a distinct and powerful stage charisma that differed substantially from her off-stage character and self-perception. However, evolution in her self-confidence and the comfort gained from her personal growth led to Beyoncé discarding this alter ego in February 2010, as revealed in an interview with Allure magazine. She felt she no longer needed the Sasha Fierce persona to express herself on stage or in her music. Even though she retired the Sasha Fierce persona, Beyoncé later announced in May 2012 that she would be bringing Sasha back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows performed in the same month. This indicated that the Sasha Fierce persona still held a significant value for Beyoncé in terms of aiding her performance energy and dynamism on stage.

The Devensian glaciation, also known as the Weichselian glaciation, Last Glacial Maximum or the last ice age, is the most recent glacial period in the British Isles, occurring from around 115,000 to around 11,700 years ago. This time period coincided with severe cold conditions and extensive ice sheets covering parts of North America, Northern Europe, and Asia. When the Devensian glaciation ended, it marked the commencement of a relatively warmer period known as the Holocene, the epoch in which we currently live. The end of this glaciation triggered a substantial retreat of the ice sheets, causing dramatic landscapes changes. The melting of the glaciers led to an increase in global sea levels. For the British Isles, this spelled the submergence of Doggerland, the land bridge linking Britain to mainland Europe, and gradually led the British Isles to become an island. However, the direct assertion regarding a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland is contested. There is evidence both for a short-lived land bridge and for separate Irish and British ice sheets during the last glacial maximum. Moreover, it is important to note that the retreat of the ice had significant implications on the flora and fauna of the British Isles. Before and during the Devensian glaciation, much of Britain was uninhabitable due to the extreme cold conditions. As the ice sheets retreated at the end of the Devensian, plants, animals and human populations were able to recolonize these lands. Therefore, to build a comprehensive answer to the question, it is important to consider landscape changes, sea-level rise, ecological shift, and human migration patterns in addition to any specific hypothesis about the existence of a land bridge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This keen sense of timing, along with their natural charisma, allows Sasha to effortlessly bring about laughter and joy in their social circle. While their lightheartedness and eagerness to evoke happiness in others are certainly prominent aspects of their personality, it is important not to dismiss the possibility of a deeply empathetic and compassionate nature. Sasha's ability to quickly connect with their friends and uplift their spirits by offering a comical gesture suggests that they genuinely care for the well-being of those around them. This empathic demeanor sets the foundation for sincere and lasting friendships, balancing their humorous side with a heartfelt concern for others. Additionally, Sasha's spontaneous silliness might also indicate a creatively inclined mind. Their capacity to concoct vivid facial expressions on the spot, capturing the attention of their audience, is not merely a sign of their innate comedic flair but also a testament to their potential for resourcefulness, quick-wittedness, and adaptability. Their vibrant personality is likely to shine through in other facets of their life, whether it be related to hobbies, professional pursuits, or ventures outside of their comfort zone.

Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tom Barrett began a final push Saturday to connect with voters in person before next week's historic recall election, appearing at farm breakfasts and restaurants and rallying campaign workers. Walker is only the third U.S. governor to face a recall. The drive to oust him was spurred by anger over his plan to effectively end most public workers' collective bargaining rights. Walker insisted he had to make the move to balance the state budget, but Democrats portrayed the measure as an attack on organized labor. Polls show a tight race with only a handful of voters still undecided before Tuesday's election, and Walker and Barrett have been struggling to win them over for the past month. Barrett released a new television ad Saturday, again calling on the governor to explain his role in an ongoing investigation of associates during Walker's tenure as Milwaukee County executive, but the candidates mostly used the day to meet voters. Barrett, who serves as Milwaukee's mayor, spent the day on the other side of the state, starting with the Barron County Dairy Breakfast in Hillsdale, a burg of 1,250 people about 90 miles west of Minneapolis. The rest of his schedule included stops at a cafe in St. Croix Falls, a pizza joint in Superior and the state Democratic Party's office in Chippewa Falls. \\"We're going to cover the whole state here in the next four days,\\" Barrett said in a telephone interview. \\"I love it. This is the part that really gets your juices flowing. This is where I'm most confident, doing this.\\" Walker began his day before 7 a.m., serving food at a dairy breakfast on a massive farm just outside Evansville, a city of 5,000 people about 25 miles south of Madison, the state capital. His agenda called for a stop at another dairy breakfast in Monroe County before visiting campaign field offices in Hudson, Wausau, Green Bay and Wauwatosa. \\"I feel good,\\" Walker said. \\"We're not taking anything for granted. We're working all the way up to 8 p.m. on Tuesday.\\" Dressed in blue jeans, hiking boots and a button-down shirt and flanked by 18-year-old Evansville Future Farmers of America Queen Emily Templeton and 18-year-old La Prairie 4-H Club Queen Erica Ballmer, the governor handed out yogurt and applesauce to scores of people at the annual Rock County Dairy Breakfast. A smiling Walker tried to engage people in short, friendly conversations, commenting, for example, on the beautiful morning. Most didn't seem to recognize him. They simply said \\"thank you\\" as he placed yogurt cups on their plates and moved on. A handful of people shook his hand, though, and congratulated him on his accomplishments. One of them was Ken Pierson, 44, who runs a tool-and-die shop in Janesville with his father. He made a point of introducing his two sons to the governor. Later, he said he thinks Walker's changes will help the state in the long run and the recall isn't justified. \\"There's better things to do, better reasons to go after people. It's just too obnoxious for me,\\" Pierson said. \\"I see (Walker's fiscal conservatism) working in the future. It has more to do with what's going to happen tomorrow, instead of \`gimme, gimme, gimme.\\"' The recall represents the latest chapter in a knockdown, no-holds barred political battle that has consumed the state. The fight began in February 2011 when Walker introduced the collective bargaining measure. Tens of thousands of people descended on the state Capitol to demonstrate against the plan and minority Democrats in the state Senate fled to Illinois in a futile attempt to block a vote. Republicans who controlled the Legislature pushed the plan through anyway. Democrats have been looking for payback ever since. They ousted two GOP state senators in recalls last August and gathered enough signatures on recall petitions this winter to force Walker and four other Republican officeholders into Tuesday's elections. The race between Walker and Barrett, especially, has evolved into a national referendum on union power. Republicans across the country have rallied around the governor, helping him raise a jaw-dropping 31 million in campaign cash. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, a Janesville Republican, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared a tea party rally in Caledonia, just outside Racine, Saturday morning and implored hundreds in the crowd to get as many people to the polls as they can on Tuesday. They said a Walker win would segue into defeat for President Barack Obama in Wisconsin in November. \\"This is an election that will send shockwaves throughout America,\\" Ryan told the crowd. \\"It is a momentum maker or a momentum breaker.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the political campaign activities of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tom Barrett in the lead-up to the historic recall election in Wisconsin. Both candidates engaged in various efforts to connect with voters in person, attending events, and visiting campaign offices. Walker faced the recall election due to changes he made to public workers' collective bargaining rights, which he claimed were necessary to balance the state budget. Democrats accused him of attacking organized labor. The recall election had a significant impact on the state's political landscape and was considered a national referendum on union power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A genius.\\" On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \\"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.

These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose \\"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\\". To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Washington Redskins hurt by lack of indoor practice facility Or, as was the case Thursday, scrambling for their cars. The Redskins are the only cold-weather NFL team that lacks an indoor practice facility or bubble-covered field for use when the weather turns nasty. The occasional inconvenience has been an obvious irritant to the coaching staff; when snow fell Thursday, players were forced to drive themselves to an off-site fitness center because the team couldn't charter buses in time. And it may be a sore spot given the team's recent history of late-season struggles. Fourteen of the NFL's 32 franchises own and operate indoor practice facilities with regulation fields inside. Seven others have practice bubbles, two occasionally train in their domed stadiums and four have rental agreements with nearby facilities. Only four other franchises have no readily available indoor training options, but all are located in California or Florida. \\"Any time you can have a full practice, and go through it full speed and run, it's better than walk-throughs\\" in a gymnasium, cornerback Carlos Rogers said Thursday. \\"Walk-throughs [are] more mental and getting things down. \\"You can be tough and say, 'It's Redskins weather.' But to have that full practice, I think that's better than anything.\\" Six times this season, the Redskins have postponed practice or changed venues because of inclement weather. On Wednesday, the team moved practice to its rarely used, hard, artificial turf field at Redskins Park in Ashburn because the team's grass fields were frozen solid. \\"The choices were limited,\\" Coach Mike Shanahan said. They were even more limited Thursday when it snowed and the team didn't have enough time to charter buses to a nearby fitness facility. Equipment managers shoved bags of balls and cameras for filming practice into the backs of SUVs. Earlier this month, rain forced the Redskins to practice on indoor basketball courts. In September and October, players were bused to an empty airport hangar at Dulles International Airport. In August, practice was delayed five hours by rain. Each time the team went indoors, Shanahan described the practices as little more than \\"jog-throughs.\\" On other days, the team has trained outside regardless of the temperature, but its cold-weather production in recent years has been dismal. Washington is 5-17 in games in November, December and January since 2008, including its 1-4 mark this season. An indoor training facility \\"is something, in my opinion, that you need,\\" said Charley Casserly, the Redskins' general manager for 23 years until Snyder fired him in 1999. But \\"obviously I was on record 20 years ago saying you didn't need one.\\" Indeed, when Redskins Park opened in Ashburn in 1992 with Casserly at the franchise's helm, he spent little time considering the benefits of an indoor facility. But Casserly, now an NFL pregame analyst for CBS Sports, has altered his viewpoint over the years, citing various changes in circumstance: the Redskins' commitment to holding training camp at the facility; the later end to the NFL season; the possible addition of two more regular season games in the next collective bargaining agreement; and the proliferation of such facilities among the Redskins' competitors. Summary:","completion":"The Washington Redskins stand as the only cold-weather NFL team that lacks an indoor practice facility or bubble-covered field, leading to inconveniences and disruptions during their training. Due to inclement weather, players were forced to drive themselves to an off-site fitness center. The team's late-season struggles might be linked to this issue since a proper full-speed practice can only be conducted in a suitable indoor facility. The situation contrasts with numerous franchises that own indoor practice facilities or have rental agreements with nearby facilities. The Redskins have postponed practice or changed venues several times this season due to weather conditions. Despite some resistance in the past, it is widely believed now that an indoor training facility is necessary to ensure the team's success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Players are, however, permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point. A violation by the shooter cancels the free throw; a violation by the defensive team results in a substitute free throw if the shooter missed; a violation by the offensive team or a shot that completely misses the hoop results in the loss of possession to the defensive team (only if it is on the last free throw).

John William Heisman (October 23, 1869 - October 3, 1936) was a player and coach of American football, baseball, and basketball, as well as a sportswriter and actor. He served as the head football coach at Oberlin College, Buchtel College (now known as the University of Akron), Auburn University, Clemson University, Georgia Tech, the University of Pennsylvania, Washington & Jefferson College, and Rice University, compiling a career college football record of 186-70-18. In 1917, Heisman's Georgia Tech Golden Tornado were recognized as the national champion. Heisman was also the head basketball coach at Georgia Tech, tallying a mark of 9-14, and the head baseball coach at Buchtel, Clemson, and Georgia Tech, amassing a career college baseball record of 199-108-7. The 1906 Georgia Tech team beat Auburn for the first time, and in a loss to Sewanee first used Heisman's jump shift offense, which became known as the Heisman shift. In the jump shift, all but the center may shift into various formations, with a jump before the snap. A play started with only the center on the line of scrimmage. The backfield would be in a vertical line, as if in an I-formation with an extra halfback, or a giant T. After the shift, a split second elapsed, and then the ball was snapped. In one common instance of the jump shift, the line shifted to put the center between guard and tackle. The three backs nearest the line of scrimmage would shift all to one side, and the center snapped it to the tailback. The 1907 team played its games at Ponce de Leon Park, where the Atlanta Crackers also played. The team went 4-4, and suffered Heisman's worst loss at Georgia Tech, 54-0 to Vanderbilt. \\"Twenty Percent\\" Davis, considered twenty percent of the team's worth, was selected All-Southern. Chip Robert was captain of the 1908 team which went 6-3, including a 44-0 blowout loss to Auburn in which Lew Hardage returned a kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown. Davis again was All-Southern. Georgia attacked Georgia Tech's recruitment tactics in football. Georgia alumni incited an SIAA investigation, claiming that Georgia Tech had created a fraudulent scholarship fund. The SIAA ruled in favor of Georgia Tech, but the 1908 game was cancelled that season due to bad blood between the rivals. Davis was captain of the 1909 team, which won seven games but was shutout by SIAA champion Sewanee and Auburn. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Hey there!

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emilie Charlotte Langtry (nee Le Breton; October 13, 1853 - February 12, 1929), known as Lillie (or Lily) Langtry and nicknamed \\"The Jersey Lily\\", was a British-American socialite, actress and producer. Born on the island of Jersey, upon marrying she moved to London in 1876. Her looks and personality attracted interest, commentary, and invitations from artists and society hostesses, and she was celebrated as a young woman of great beauty and charm. By 1881, she had become an actress and starred in many plays in the UK and the United States, including She Stoops to Conquer, The Lady of Lyons, and After the divorce from her husband, Langtry was linked in the popular press to Prince Louis Esterhazy; they shared time together and both had an interest in horse racing. However, in 1899, she married 28-year-old Hugo Gerald de Bathe (1871-1940), son of Sir Henry de Bathe, 4th Baronet and Charlotte Clare. Hugo's parents had initially not married, due to objections from the de Bathe family. They lived together and seven of their children were born out of wedlock. They married after the death of Sir Henry's father in 1870, and Hugo was their first son born in wedlock - making him heir to the baronetcy. The wedding between Langtry and de Bathe took place in St Saviour's Church, Jersey, on July 27, 1899, with Jeanne Marie Langtry being the only other person present, apart from the officials. This was the same day that Langtry's horse, Merman, won the Goodwood Cup. In December 1899, de Bathe volunteered to join the British forces in the Boer War. He was assigned to the Robert's Horse mounted brigade as a lieutenant. In 1907, Hugo's father died; he became the 5th Baronet, and Langtry became Lady de Bathe. When Hugo de Bathe became the 5th Baronet, he inherited properties in Sussex, Devon and Ireland; those in Sussex were in the hamlet of West Stoke near Chichester. These were: Woodend, 17 bedrooms set in 71 acres; Hollandsfield, 10 bedrooms set in 52 acres and Balsom's Farm of 206 acres. Woodend was retained as the de Bathe residence whilst the smaller Hollandsfield was let. Today the buildings retain their period appearance, but modifications and additions have been made, and the complex is now multi-occupancy. One of the houses on the site is named Langtry and another Hardy. The de Bathe properties were all sold in 1919, the same year Lady de Bathe sold Regal Lodge. What happened to them after they got married?","completion":"After Lillie Langtry and Hugo Gerald de Bathe got married, Hugo went to fight in the Boer War and later became the 5th Baronet when his father passed away in 1907.

Please answer the following question: Article: A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. Question: The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"cannot pass through space successfully\\"? A:","completion":"No, the answer \\"cannot pass through space successfully\\" is not correct. The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in sunlight has a shorter wavelength, which causes it to be scattered in different directions when it interacts with gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, and it is responsible for making the sky appear blue to us. The sunlight, including the color blue, can pass through space successfully.

The construction of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential residence of India, began in 1912 and was completed in 1929. It served as the Viceroy's House during the British Raj era until Indian independence in 1947, after which it became the official residence of the President of India. Edwin Lutyens was born on March 29, 1869, in Kensington, London. He established himself as a prominent architect in the early 20th century, with significant contributions to British architecture, particularly during and after World War I. Lutyens is widely recognized for his synthesis of classical architecture styles and elements from Indian and local traditions, which can be seen in the designs of the Rashtrapati Bhavan as well. The Rashtrapati Bhavan was designed to represent the grandeur of the British Empire in India. Sprawling over 330 acres, the estate includes the main building, which consists of 340 rooms, as well as the famous Mughal Gardens, residences of the bodyguards, staff, stables, and various other facilities. The layout and the design of the building draw inspiration from both Indian and European architecture, resulting in a spectacular blend of styles. For example, the domes of the Rashtrapati Bhavan were inspired by the Sanchi Stupa, a famous Buddhist monument in India, while the columns and other elements showcase Greco-Roman influence. The construction of the Rashtrapati Bhavan represented a massive undertaking, with building materials like bricks, sand, and stone brought in from different regions of India and skilled craftsmen employed to create intricate artwork and detailing within the edifice. The collaboration of Indian artisans and British architects also played a pivotal role in the design's fusion of styles. In conclusion, the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi was designed by the distinguished British architect Edwin Landseer Lutyens. The building's immaculate and intricate design illustrates a unique blending of architectural styles inspired by both Indian and Western traditions, serving as a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage and history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy.

John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Hint: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision).

The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.

WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains.

Article: Coffee experts are willing to pay large sums of money for high-quality coffee beans. The high-end beans, such as Kona or Blue Mountain, are known to cost extraordinary sums of money. Then there is Kopi Lowak (translated as \\"Civet Coffee\\"), the world's most expensive coffee, which sells for as much as US 50 per quarter-pound. This isn't particularly surprising, because approximately 500 pounds a year of Kopi Lowak make up the entire world supply. What is surprising is why this particular coffee is so rare. In fact, it's not the plants that are rare. It's the civet droppings. That's right, the civet droppings--the body waste of the palm civet. Coffee beans aren't Kopi Lowak until they've been digested and come out in the body waste of the palm civet. Palm civets are tree-dwelling, raccoon-like little animals, native to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. They also have a love for coffee cherries. According to Kopi Lowak suppliers, palm civets eat the fruit whole, but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact . While the beans are not destroyed, they undergo a transformation in the animal's body. A chemical substance in the digestive system of the palm civet causes some changes to the beans to give them a unique flavor . However, this is not the only explanation why coffee beans retrieved from civet droppings have a special flavor all their own. Another possible reason is that palm civets have an unfailing instinct for picking the coffee cherries at the peak of their ripeness. Kopi Lowak is reported to have a character in taste unlike any other coffee, complex with caramel undertones and an earthy flavor. Currently, most of the world's supply of Kopi Lowak is sold in Japan, though a few US markets are also starting to stock up on Kopi Lowak. Question: Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage? Options: A: Little palm civets eat only the outer layer of the coffee cherries. B: Palm civets somehow know the right time when the coffee fruit ripens. C: Kopi Lowak is most popular in Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands.

Option A is incorrect because the passage states that palm civets eat the fruit whole but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact.

Here is an article: With every passing year, every new model of portentous drivel about the Nazi era rolled out by the film industry—\\"The Reader,\\" about the travails of a concentration camp guard, comes to mind—the more indispensable the facts of history become. The clearer it is, too, how flimsy these film fantasies are as vehicles for drama, compared with that history. The latest reminder of this truth comes with a PBS documentary extraordinary in its detail and revelatory power. It's title, \\"Elusive Justice: The Search for Nazi War Criminals,\\" may be informative, but it's far from adequate for a work that yields so many surprises, the greatest of which is its freshness. Moving in unexpected directions at every turn, Jonathan Silvers's film averts the burden of predictability—no small accomplishment for work on so familiar a theme. The Nuremberg trials and their drama are familiar enough to the world, but not the face and the work of the 27-year-old American Army lawyer and investigator Benjamin Ferencz, charged with the task of collecting evidence for the Nuremberg prosecutions. The terrors of entering the just-liberated camps with their hellish scenes—the film provides striking footage, more extensive than the usual documentary clips, of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower doing just that, with Gen. Omar Bradley just behind him—caused him, he tells the filmmakers, to create a self-defense mechanism. The whole scene wasn't real, he told himself—it was \\"just a case,\\" one of many to get through, in camp after camp. He would become chief prosecutor of a special German unit, the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units operating on the Eastern front. He found the report of their daily accomplishments, which Germans meticulously recorded—a typical page of which is shown on screen, detailing how many Jewish children were killed, how many men and women had been murdered on a particular date. He counted. \\"When I got to over a million I stopped counting.\\" Tuesday, Nov. 15, 9-11 p.m. EST on PBS, whose dates and times vary; check local listings. Fridays, 8-9:30 p.m. EST on C-Span The film offers barely a touch of atrocity footage. Its subject is justice, or as the principals in the first part of the film, the liberated survivors of the camps thought of it, revenge—this documentary's only strained, largely forgettable moments. Far more dramatic testimony—and a startling vision of justice—comes in an interview with the middle-aged son of Hans Frank, governor of occupied Poland, one of the Germans hanged for crimes against humanity. \\"My father was a murderer,\\" Nicholas Frank declares, \\"one who sanctioned the acts of all the other criminals who got away.\\" One memory from his childhood stands out—the time a drunken American soldier showed up at the Frank house and lined the family up outside, threatening to shoot them all. His younger brothers and sisters cried piteously, he recalls, \\"but I had the feeling the soldier was correct—I belonged to a criminal family.\\" Nazi war criminal Kurt Lishka in Germany in 1971. Scene after scene brings the struggle for justice to life, in obscure cases as in the ones best known to history. A middle-aged journalist in Cologne, Germany, has discovered by chance, long years after the war, the name and location of the SS officer who had beaten his grandfather to death upon his arrival in Theresienstadt, a transit camp for Czech Jews and others destined for Auschwitz. The journalist had come upon a 1988 news article about a former member of the SS deported from Italy. He recounts his stubborn effort to get a German court to take action—a story this sophisticated professional tells with ease and eloquence, none of which can conceal the rage that had driven him. His grandfather had been murdered, the killer was in Germany, a democratic state now, and the appropriate prosecutor refused to take action—this could not be the end of the story. It was not. Candice Bergen, the documentary's excellent narrator, doesn't come to the subject of this film as a stranger. She is the widow of Louis Malle, whose haunting \\"Au Revoir Les Enfants\\" (1987) was based on Malle's memory of the French Catholic boys' school he attended during the war. The school had sheltered Jewish students who were ultimately betrayed and dragged off to Auschwitz, where they were gassed upon arrival. The headmaster, Lucien Bunel—Père Jacques de Jésus—was arrested and sent to Mauthausen, one of the deadliest camps in the Nazi system. The Malle film's title quotes his last words to the assembled students as he is taken away. The film Ms. Bergen narrates covers remarkably extensive territory—including a riveting commentary provided by Willam Gowan, a former U.S. Army counter-intelligence agent, on the so-called Rat Line through which Nazi war criminals of high and low rank escaped punishment by fleeing to Argentina, with help from sympathetic Vatican priests. Characteristically, the film enlarges on a familiar fact, taking it to a deeper level. The arrival of this considerable population of war criminals, an Argentinian journalist attests, had its poisonous effect on the nation as a whole. Most of them, he points out, were experts in exactly the kind of merciless repression and terrorization that the dictatorship in Argentina found useful. Asher Ben-Natan, who led efforts to capture Nazis. Section after section of the narrative is made rich in the same way—by taking the familiar in this history to newer and deeper levels. This is true no less of the final part on the complicated efforts to deport war criminals living in America. Altogether a rare achievement and a spellbinding one. \\"The Contenders,\\" C-Span's ambitious series on presidential candidates—14 in all—who lost their quest for the White House but made their mark, has been running for several weeks. The good news is that all the profiles are available at thecontenders.c-span.org. If ever a trip to an online viewing source was worth it, this is the one.

And with modern figures has come increasing intimacy, and C-Span callers (a minor part of the show, but in this case a lively one) who actually knew Republican Wendell Willkie, for instance, the Republican who ran against FDR in 1940. The same is true for famed gangbuster, and New York governor Tom Dewey, also fated to run against an invincible FDR, then, in a more famous and unexpected defeat, against Harry Truman in 1948. Mr. Dewey's son was on hand to provide—not altogether happily—details of family life and what his father thought and said about politics at the dinner table. Which was, apparently, nothing. Last weekend brought a delectable profile of Adlai Stevenson, who ran against Eisenhower twice and whose wit and eloquence is enshrined in the memory of a generation of Americans. The governor's son, Adlai Stevenson III, a retired senator, recalled watching a sales clerk stare at his credit card for a longish while, till he finally asked her if there was something familiar about the name. No, she told him, nothing familiar. \\"It's just kind of cool.\\" She meant an unusual name like that. So much for undying fame.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Kulwicki grew up in Greenfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee known for its Polish-American neighborhoods, near the Milwaukee Mile racetrack. After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. \\"I showed him how\\", Gerry Kulwicki said. \\"And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'\\" Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models - the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level - at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh. Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer, and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships. In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions.

Do you know that a long, long time ago, Mars had rivers just like Earth? Yes, that's right! Scientists have discovered that ancient riverbeds were created by warm spells on Mars. Now, you might be wondering how that happened. Well, it's all because of some exciting events like volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the way Mars moves around the Sun. Volcanic eruptions are when hot molten rock comes out of a volcano, asteroid impacts happen when a big rock from space crashes into a planet, and orbit changes are when the path a planet takes around the Sun changes. These events made Mars warmer for short periods. But guess what? These warm spells did not last for a very long time. So, even though Mars had rivers, it was not warm enough for a long time to let tiny living things grow there. The scientists studied places on Mars, like craters, to learn more about how old the rivers were. One area they looked at is called the Aeolis Dorsa region, and it is 3.6 billion years old. Wow, that's a big number! And do you know what else is interesting about Mars? Just a few weeks ago, a mysterious light was seen on a picture taken by a camera on Mars.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Erich Mielke was born in a tenement in Berlin-Wedding, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, on 28 December 1907. During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge closed the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally fit to stand trial. During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television. In 1995, parole officers and Mielke's attorneys argued that he was \\"totally confused\\" and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany's oldest prison inmate and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was \\"not interested in chasing an 87 year old man anymore\\" and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended. According to Koehler: [Mielke's] bank account, which held more than 300,000 marks (about US 187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a 15,000 acre hunting preserve. After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two room, 600-square-foot flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US512) a month. did he have any trouble in prison","completion":"According to the article, Mielke did not have significant trouble in prison.

He was also able to watch game shows on television which he enjoyed. There is no mention of any particular hardships or struggles Mielke faced whilst in prison. This information suggests that he was able to find ways to pass the time and was even provided with certain comforts that may have made his experience in prison more bearable.
