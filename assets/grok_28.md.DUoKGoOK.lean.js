Background: Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. Context: From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August--Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznan) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery. From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become \\"what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.\\" His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by \\"promoting\\" Hoffmann to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079-1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Torun). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married \\"Mischa\\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802. Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue's periodical, Die Freimuthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis (\\"The Prize\\"), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d'or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in Konigsberg. At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to Konigsberg. Question: What happened once he was promoted? Answer:","completion":"Once Hoffmann was promoted, he was relocated to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland. He visited the place to arrange lodging before returning to Posen, where he married \\"Mischa\\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802. Hoffmann was initially unhappy with his exile and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. However, he made use of his isolation by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803 and contributed articles to various publications. Eventually, he obtained a post at Warsaw in 1804 and left for the new position, passing through his hometown and meeting one of Cora Hatt's daughters."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Article: Did you watch the 2012 London Olympic Games?

Chief among them are the growing popularity and demand for cricket in both countries and the mutual desire to strengthen ties on and off the field. With the Test series being viewed as the pinnacle format of the game, both nations hope that the extended competition will foster greater camaraderie and showcase the best that the sport has to offer.

They heard about something called \\"renewable energy,\\" which meant using energy sources like the sun, wind, and rain instead of using things like oil and coal, which are not good for the planet. A group of smart people looked at the situation in Wales and wrote a report about how people there could use renewable energy to make their land happier and healthier. But, the report found that there were several \\"missed opportunities\\" - meaning people didn't invest enough money or time into using renewable energy. These smart people were a little sad because they knew that if Wales had used more renewable energy, they could have made their country's economy much stronger and the people living there could have been even happier. Their beautiful land could have been a shining example for how to take care of the Earth and use clean energy to make everything better. Even though they missed some chances, the report still gave some ideas on how they could improve.

It does mention that he was a \\"Telugu movie script writer, playwright, and lyricist,\\" specifically naming several Telugu films in which he contributed namely - \\"Patala Bhairavi\\", \\"Mayabazar\\" and \\"Missamma.\\" However, the paragraph does not specify that he wrote exclusively for Telugu films. The hypothesis, therefore, that Pingali Nagendrarao wrote only for Telugu movies can neither be confirmed nor rejected based on the information given in this paragraph. It's quite possible that he may have worked in other regional film industries or in other languages. To confirm or deny this hypothesis with certainty, more detailed information or broader context about Pingali Nagendrarao’s entire filmography and career is required. This would include any potential work he might have done in other language films, for other industries, or in other media formats like television or radio. Therefore, based on the information provided it can be inferred that Pingali Nagendrarao did write for Telugu movies but whether he wrote only for Telugu movies remains unconfirmed. For a definitive validation or rejection of the hypothesis, one needs to consult a more comprehensive career profile or biography of Pingali Nagendrarao that enumerates all his professional engagements. Also, taking cues from this paragraph, it may be worth noting that Pingali Nagendrarao had a versatile career as a scriptwriter, playwright, and lyricist. This may suggest a possible involvement in diverse media environments and not necessarily limiting him to Telugu movies.

The Earth consists of several layers that vary in terms of their composition, structure, and depth. Generally, it is composed of the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. Step 2: Identify the outermost layer. The outermost layer of the Earth, the one we live on, is the Earth's crust. This layer is particularly thin compared to the layers below it and can be made of continental crust (rich in granitic rocks) or oceanic crust (mainly composed of basaltic rocks). Step 3: Verify the answer. The crust is the layer that forms the Earth's surface and makes up the continents and ocean floor. As this is the layer we are referring to when talking about the outermost layer, the answer is correct.

Definition: Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it. Input: Bond lengths are intermediate between covalent single bonds and what? Output:","completion":"Bond lengths are intermediate between covalent single bonds and covalent double bonds. Firstly, let's break down this scientific question. The task here is asking for the type of bond that, in comparison to covalent single bonds, has a bond length that is intermediate. Covalent bonds are a type of chemical bond where two atoms share electrons. There are different types of covalent bonds, namely single, double, and triple covalent bonds. The difference among these kinds lies in the number of shared electron pairs: single bonds have one shared pair, double bonds have two, and triple bonds have three. Understanding these basics about covalent bonds, we can make sense of the question we're trying to answer. If a bond length is intermediate, it means it's somewhere in between - not the shortest, not the longest. Using these guidelines: 1. Identify that the task is asking about the type of bond with a bond length somewhere between a single covalent bond. 2. Recall that the types of covalent bonds are single, double, and triple. 3. Remember that as you go from a single to a triple bond, bond length decreases (bonds get shorter), and bond strength increases. The correct answer is a covalent double bond. This is because a covalent double bond has a bond length that is shorter than a single bond, but longer than a triple bond - therefore, it is intermediate compared to a single and a triple bond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction.

Now let's consider the options: 1. Yes - This option would be true if the Yankees were shown to be actively attempting to improve Johnny's reputation by portraying him as an ally of the Southerners. However, this is not the case in the provided premise, as they are attempting to make him look like a Rebel, which could potentially have negative consequences for Johnny. 2.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: What did Dean say that made Joanna angry? She is inventing things to complain about because her life is so pampered and boring. A:","completion":"Title: \\"Sound of Silence\\" The movie opens with Joanna Moore, a highly successful, pampered, suburban woman living a seemingly perfect life in a plush California neighborhood. She has everything luxury can offer - a mega-mansion, a Ferrari, designer clothes, etc., but an empty, monotonous routine. Her husband, Dean Moore, is a renowned tech tycoon. Dean is passionate about his work and is often occupied, leaving a vast wealth of time untapped for Joanna's disposal. Joanna repeatedly tries to fill this void with lavish cocktail parties, charity galas, yacht clubs, but it all feels empty, superficial, and redundant. Nonetheless, she puts on a brave face and tries to find happiness in her well-curated yet hollow life. One day, during a charity event at her mansion, a distraught Joanna hears Dean: \\"Joanna only complains because her life lacks any real challenge. She doesn’t appreciate what she has because she never needed to fight for anything.” These candid words, overheard unintentionally, leave Joanna feeling vilified and utterly unworthy, her world comes crashing down. Joanna's search for meaning intensifies, she feels she needs to prove Dean wrong and decide to step out of her comfort cocoon. Joanna starts by undertaking small challenges, pushing herself to step away from her comfort zone—a cooking class here, a painting workshop there. She even volunteers at the local charity, working directly with those less privileged. As she spends her time doing these things, an idea sparks within her. She decides to start an innovative tech venture, a project to help low-income families have access to affordable technology, a move that would also return a sense of purpose and meaning to her life. An uphill battle awaits Joanna as she embarks on this endeavour. Without previous business or technology experience, she is underestimated and laughed at, but Joanna is undeterred. She toils and puts close to heart everything she learns, proving her doubters wrong one step at a time. She faces numerous disappointments, setbacks, but every time, she imagines Dean's dismissive words, which only fuel her resolve. In this new world, Joanna learns truths about existence outside her pampered life—about struggle, resilience, and going beyond one's limits. She works tirelessly, her venture eventually catching the eyes of noteworthy investors, including her husband, who initially scoffs at her attempts. As the venture begins to flourish, Joanna finds the sense of fulfilment she had yearned for. Her life is far from boring now, far removed from the superficial galas and parties. She realizes that she no longer needs to invent things to complain about; she could, instead, help invent solutions to people's problems. The movie culminates in a grand launch of Joanna's venture. Dean, surprised and humbled by Joanna's transformation, admits his initial misunderstanding about Joanna. He apologizes, acknowledging that Joanna's determination had indeed changed her life and those around her. However, Joanna is no longer fueled by his words. The anger has subsided, replaced by a sense of accomplishment; her fulfillment did not depend on Dean anymore. \\"Sound of Silence\\" is a journey of enlightenment, a story of how a woman's quest for meaning and challenge against the conventions of her pampered life led her to discover a version of herself she never knew existed—an inspiring tale of self-discovery and perseverance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But when digging into the numbers, researchers have found a wide range of responses to regimens: Some people reap tremendous benefits, while others actually regress in their fitness, reports the New York Times. But new research suggests that these so-called \\"non-responders\\" just need to switch up their game plan and find something their bodies respond to instead of sweating over lack of progress. Reporting in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers note a simple at-home test that can help people learn if they're getting anything out of a particular workout: Measure your fitness level before starting a new fitness regimen by quickly stepping onto and off a box or climbing stairs, then check your pulse to get a baseline number. After a month of exercising, do the test again; if your pulse rate hasn't gone down, you might not be responding to the exercise you chose and you should consider a different type of workout. Researchers found that people who didn't respond well to endurance training did respond to interval training, and vice versa. These findings suggest \\"there is no one-size-fits-all approach to exercise,\\" the lead researcher tells the Times. \\"But it does seem as if there is some size that fits everyone.\\" While they have yet to find any correlation between age, sex, or ethnicity and being a non-responder, researchers find it tends to run in families, suggesting genes play a role. And roughly a third of people tested fit the bill. Some non-responders benefit from higher-intensity workouts in particular, meaning that this study highlights why the \\"just get to the gym\\" advice doesn't work for everyone, Shape notes: \\"You're better off turning up the intensity—whether it's with bodyweight Tabata workouts, functional fitness routines, or lifting free weights.\\" (Don't like intense workouts? Music helps.)","completion":"Title: Finding the Right Workout Regime: No One-Size-Fits-All Approach Introduction Working out and staying fit is widely acknowledged as good for the human body. However, research has shown that various fitness regimens elicit different responses from individuals, with some experiencing vast improvements in their fitness levels and others regressing. The New York Times reports that new research suggests these \\"non-responders\\" may need to adapt their approach to exercise to find a routine that works for them. A Personalized Approach to Exercise The journal PLOS ONE published research highlighting a simple at-home test to help individuals determine if they are benefiting from their current workout routine. This test involves measuring one's fitness level by performing a stepping or stair-climbing exercise before starting a new fitness regimen, then checking one's pulse to establish a baseline number. After a month of exercising, the test is repeated, and if the pulse rate remains unchanged, it may be an indication that the chosen exercise is not providing the desired benefits. Interestingly, it was found that individuals who did not respond well to endurance training generally responded favorably to interval training, and vice versa. In essence, this research suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to exercise. However, it does imply that everyone can find an exercise regime that suits their body and yields the desired results. Genetics and Non-Responders Researchers have not found any correlation between age, sex, or ethnicity and being a non-responder. However, it has been observed that being a non-responder tends to run in families, which suggests that genetics play a role in this phenomenon. Approximately a third of people tested were found to be non-responders. Some non-responders benefit significantly from higher-intensity workouts. This finding emphasizes that the adage \\"just get to the gym\\" might not be effective or beneficial for everyone. Instead, it is more crucial to focus on increasing the intensity of workouts, whether by engaging in bodyweight Tabata workouts, functional fitness routines, or incorporating free weights into one's exercise regimen. For individuals who dislike intense workouts, adding music can enhance their overall experience and motivation during the workout. Conclusion In conclusion, the most important takeaway from this research is that there is no universal approach to exercise that works for everyone. Each individual needs to find a workout routine that their body responds well to, ensuring progress in their fitness journey. By conducting the simple at-home test and making necessary adjustments to one's exercise routine, individuals can reap the benefits of working out and improve their overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa. He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin. and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Please answer this question : Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Members of tribe A, who have darker skin, will be at a greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. This assertion is due to the correlation between skin pigmentation and the capacity to absorb UV light, which is a determinant factor in the process of vitamin D synthesis. The skin color is majorly defined by a pigment known as melanin, which is produced by cells in the epidermis called melanocytes. Notably, all human beings have approximately the same number of melanocytes, but it is the amount of melanin that these cells produce that varies and ultimately determines skin color. Individuals with darker skin, such as those from tribe A, are characterized by their melanocytes producing more melanin. This high melanin output is not only genetically hereditary but also reactive, increasing as a protective response to greater exposure to UV light. Melanin principally serves the purpose of blocking UV radiation to prevent the harmful effects of too much sun exposure, such as sunburn and skin cancers. The gift and the curse of this increased melanin production are that while it provides a more efficient natural shield against possible damage from the sun's rays, it also restricts the quantity of UV light that can penetrate the skin. This is significant because exposure to UV light, particularly UVB radiation, is crucial for the synthesis of vitamin D in the human body – a process that takes place in the skin. Consequently, people with darker skin, who have more melanin, generally require more prolonged exposure to sunny conditions than those with lighter skin to generate the same amount of vitamin D. By extension, this means that individuals with darker skin like tribe A members are inherently more susceptible to vitamin D deficiency, particularly if they don't get enough sunlight or consume sufficient amounts of vitamin D through their diet or supplements. Thus, even though both tribes spend a significant part of the day outside and are therefore exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light, the darker-skinned members of tribe A are still at a stronger risk of vitamin D deficiency due to the effective natural UV protection provided by their greater melanin production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But never have they had such far-reaching effects, nor so quickly. The world of bonds is being turned upside down as a result. Monetary policy traditionally has involved adjusting a short-term rate of interest that can then, over time, affect the structure of long-term rates that are set by markets. But central banks’ bond purchases and ultralow interest rates mean that distortions are rife. Some ripples are having immediate impacts: the Bank of England’s new quantitative easing program, for instance, has turbocharged the U.K. bond market. The failure of the BOE to buy as many bonds as it wanted Tuesday pushed long-dated gilt yields to new historic lows: the 30-year yield, which three months ago was 2.3%, now stands at 1.3%. Gilts maturing in 25 years or more have returned an extraordinary 34.8% so far in 2016, according to Barclays . But the pernicious ripple effects from ultralow interest rates are more to do with their persistence. This is clearest perhaps in Germany, where the long decline in yields driven by the European Central Bank has produced a strange new breed of zero-coupon bonds. A traditional zero-coupon bond is sold at a deep discount to face value. Investors don’t get any interest payments, but the bond’s price should rise as it gets closer to maturity. In effect, buyers of such instruments opt to defer their interest payments and receive them all in one hit, along with their principal repayment. For instance, a Tradeweb calculator shows that a zero coupon 10-year bond yielding 3.5% would be priced at 70.9% of face value. The new mutation still pays no interest. But buyers get no uplift over time either because, with yields in negative territory, these securities are being priced at more than face value. The pull to par has become a drag: a buy-and-hold investor is guaranteed to lose money, even before taking inflation into account. The only way to make money is to find another buyer willing to pay a higher price—but that implies a bigger loss down the road. Germany now has more than €160 billion of zero-coupon bonds in issue. All of its two-year notes pay no interest, along with three of its five-year notes; all of them trade above face value. Most remarkably, in July Germany issued a 10-year zero-coupon note at a price above par. Wednesday, it tapped that issue at an even higher price, and an even more negative yield. The longer rates stay at these levels, the more zero-coupon bonds there will be. The crucial thing to understand is that these instruments are no longer bonds—at least not in the traditional sense. With no income attached to them, they are simply bets on the price another investor is willing to pay. They will also be more volatile: the long wait for repayment means small changes in yield will have a big effect on current prices. Bonds are traditionally viewed as a haven. But the new world of bonds has never looked more risky.

The Agnes River is a perennial river of the South Gippsland catchment , located in the West Gippsland region of the Australian state of Victoria . The Agnes River is a multi-year river of the South Gippsland , in the West Gippsland region of the Australian state of Victoria .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences convey the same meaning with slightly different wordings. Let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences. 1. Both sentences mention \\"Agnes River,\\" \\"South Gippsland,\\" \\"West Gippsland region,\\" and \\"Australian state of Victoria,\\" which are the primary details about the river's location. Sentence 1: \\"The Agnes River is a perennial river of the South Gippsland catchment, located in the West Gippsland region of the Australian state of Victoria.\\" Sentence 2: \\"The Agnes River is a multi-year river of the South Gippsland, in the West Gippsland region of the Australian state of Victoria.\\" 2. The first sentence uses the term \\"perennial river,\\" while the second sentence uses the term \\"multi-year river.\\" Both of these words signify the same concept: a river that flows continuously throughout the year. Perennial rivers are fed by rainwater, groundwater, or melting snow and ice, which enable them to maintain a consistent flow regardless of seasonal changes. 3. The first sentence includes the term \\"catchment,\\" which refers to an area where water is collected and channeled into rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water. The second sentence does not mention catchment, leading to a slightly less specific description of the Agnes River's location. However, since the primary area of interest – South Gippsland – is mentioned in both sentences, readers can still understand that the Agnes River is part of the South Gippsland water system. 4. Finally, the two sentences use different prepositions to describe the river's location within the West Gippsland region. The first sentence says \\"located in the West Gippsland region,\\" while the second one uses \\"in the West Gippsland region.\\" Despite this slight structural difference, the meaning remains the same. In summary, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, with only minor changes in phrasing and structure. They both describe the Agnes River in the context of the South Gippsland and West Gippsland regions within the Australian state of Victoria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Associated President Jeff Follmer said Sunday that officers are \\"not trained to shoot people in the leg.\\" According to Follmer, \\"If we pull that trigger, we feel our lives are in danger.\\" 6:15 p.m. - The fatal shooting of children under 13 by police is an extremely rare occurrence in U.S. criminal justice, though no real data on these types of crimes exists. John Harper found no other incident where an officer confronted and killed a child younger than 12-years-old. 5 p.m. - The second rally of the day begins at the Cuddell Recreation Center, the scene of the shooting, where dozens of protestors showed up with handmade signs. Mary Kilpatrick reports that about about 60 people attended, including Tamir's older sister, who spoke out against her brother's killing, saying \\"I don't know why they did that. He was only 12. He wanted to play basketball or the NBA. He loved everybody.\\" Dozens gathered at Cudell Rec Center in Cleveland for #TamirRice rally. @clevelanddotcom pic.twitter.com/9zsUQAYDhc — Brandon Blackwell (@BlackwellTweets) November 24, 2014 5 p.m. - The coroner releases the cause of death for Tamir Rice as a gunshot wound to the torso with injuries to major vessels, intestines and the pelvis.

Our Sara Dorn reports, There are no policies for dealing specifically with armed children, Strategies for Youth founder Lisa Thurau said: \\"Some of it is a function of training, and some of it is a function of natural innate ability. Some officers are more attuned to the needs of young people.\\" 2:08 p.m. - At the press conference this morning, police said Rice and the officer were less than 10 feet apart at the time of the shooting. Last night, Rice's father Gregory Henderson told our Cory Shaffer, \\"Why not taze him?

For example: Q: What regulations govern the sale or possession of imitation firearms in Ohio and in Cleveland? A: Ohio law prohibits persons under age 18 from owning or possessing firearms, but neither state law nor federal law defines airsoft guns as firearms. In Cleveland, it is illegal to sell \\"replica or facsimile firearms,\\" including air guns. The law does not apply to a device that is distinctly colored, has an exaggerated size, or has a design feature that makes it appear different from a real firearm.

On Monday, Cleveland police said officers fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice as the youth reached for an air pistol in his waist. Chief Calvin Williams said the air pistol was \\"indistinguishable from a real firearm.\\" An orange tip indicating the gun was not a real firearm had been removed, police said. \\"Our officers at times are required to make critical decisions in a split second,\\" Williams said at a news conference \\"Unfortunately, this was one of those times.\\" The incident comes as the nation nervously awaits a grand jury decision on whether to charge the police officer who killed African-American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. But Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said events in Ferguson don't concern him. JUST WATCHED 12-year-old killed by cops over air gun Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 12-year-old killed by cops over air gun 01:55 \\"Ferguson being out there or not being out there doesn't matter,\\" the mayor said at the news conference. \\"This is about the fact that a young boy was shot and killed in Cleveland.\\" The attorney for the family of the Cleveland youngster, who also was black, downplayed any possible racial connotations to the shooting. Police have not disclosed the race of the officer who shot Tamir. \\"This is not a black and white issue. This is a right and wrong issue,\\" attorney Tim Kucharski said. Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said video showing the Saturday shooting exists, but he didn't say where the video comes from. He said representatives for Rice's family have viewed the video and the family will decide later whether to look at it. Tomba said the video is not available for journalists now because it's part of an active investigation, which the department plans to complete in 90 days and send to the district attorney. 'There's a guy in there with a pistol' The incident began Saturday when police were summoned to a city recreation center by a 911 caller who said someone -- possibly a juvenile -- was pointing \\"a pistol\\" at people. \\"There's a guy in there with a pistol, you know, it's probably fake, but he's like pointing it at everybody,\\" the caller said. \\"He's sitting on a swing right now, but he's pulling it in and out of his pants and pointing it at people,\\" the caller said. \\"He's probably a juvenile, you know?\\" Police said it's not clear if the responding officers received the information about the age of the suspect or the gun being \\"probably fake.\\" When the two officers arrived, the boy did not point the air gun at them or otherwise threaten them, Tomba told reporters Sunday. But he did reach for the air gun, Tomba said. \\"The officers ordered him to stop and to show his hands, and he went into his waistband and pulled out the weapon,\\" he said. Tamir died early Sunday at MetroHealth Medical Center after surgery, according to the hospital and the family's attorney. Tomba showed reporters the air gun the boy was said to be reaching for -- a large, black BB- or pellet-type replica gun resembling a semiautomatic pistol. An orange tip indicating the gun was not a real firearm had been removed, police said. On Monday, Williams said that the \\"facsimile weapon in this incident was indistinguishable from a real firearm.\\" Both officers have been placed on leave, police said. The head of the police union said the officers followed protocols. \\"As they approached the male, they are screaming at him, 'Put your hands up, put your hands up' -- they don't want his hands to go anywhere down by the waistband,\\" Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association President Jeff Follmer told CNN affiliate WJW. \\"I can tell you the officer that fired had no clue that he was 12, he just thought it was an older male. There was more concentration on his hands because we are taught in the academy that hands will kill you,\\" Follmer told the station. 'It was a child' Residents reacted angrily. \\"It wasn't a dog. It was a child. You didn't give him a chance. You just killed him,\\" one man told CNN affiliate WEWS. Someone claiming to represent the online activist group Anonymous claimed in a YouTube video to have taken down the city's website, blaming the shooting on what the speaker said was \\"an overzealous rookie officer\\" who resorted too quickly to lethal force. \\"Officers are equipped with many nonlethal options such as Taser guns,\\" the speaker said. \\"Why did he not use a Taser on this child? Shooting him in cold blood was not necessary with these nonlethal options available.\\" However, Follmer said officers had no way to know the air gun wasn't a real firearm. \\"You feel bad, after the fact, that it was a 12-year-old,\\" he said. \\"Nobody wants to shoot a 12-year-old, especially when they are holding a fake gun. But that's not the perception the officers had at that time.\\" Chief Williams said parents need to teach children that \\"guns are not toys,\\" whether they're real or fake. Police shootings of African-Americans, particularly young men, have been under rising scrutiny in recent months after Brown's shooting following a brief confrontation in Ferguson. A grand jury there is expected to soon make a decision whether Officer Darren Wilson should face criminal charges in that incident, which resulted in widespread protests over police violence against African-Americans. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Her mother, Sylvia Watkins, studied both cello and piano and was one of the top three students in her class at the Royal College of Music. Heyer's paternal grandfather had emigrated from Russia, while her maternal grandparents owned tugboats on the River Thames. Heyer was the eldest of three children; her brothers George Boris (known as Boris) and Frank were four and nine years younger than her. For part of her childhood, the family lived in Paris but they returned to England shortly after World War I broke out in 1914. Although the family's surname had been pronounced \\"higher\\", the advent of war led her father to switch to the pronunciation \\"hair\\" so they would not be mistaken for Germans. During the war, her father served as a requisitions officer for the British Army in France. After the war ended he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). He left the army in 1920 with the rank of captain, taught at King's College London and sometimes wrote for The Granta. George Heyer strongly encouraged his children to read and never forbade any book. Georgette read widely and often met with her friends Joanna Cannan and Carola Oman to discuss books. Heyer and Oman later shared their works-in-progress with each other and offered criticism. When she was 17, Heyer began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was released in 1921. According to her biographer Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the \\"saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men\\".

Answer the following question: Information: - Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert (16 November 1717 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the \\"Encyclopédie\\". D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Jean - Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert ( / dælmbr / ; French : ( batist l dalb ) ; 17 November 1717 -- 29 October 1783 ) was a French mathematician , mechanician , physicist , philosopher , and music theorist . Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the Encyclopédie . D'Alembert 's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him . The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert 's equation . - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ; in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (\\"Encyclopaedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\\") was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the \\"Encyclopédistes\\". It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The Encyclopédistes were members of the Société des gens de lettres, a French writer's society, who contributed to the development of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" from June 1751 to December 1765 under editors Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment. - The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of wavesas they occur in physicssuch as sound waves, light waves and water waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Denis Diderot (5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the \\"Encyclopédie\\" along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert. - In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a transmission medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the \\"reception\\" of such waves and their \\"perception\\" by the brain. Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound above 20 kHz is ultrasound and below 20 Hz is infrasound. Other animals have different hearing ranges. - The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"The two questions provided are inquiring about distinct information. The correct answer is: a) no. To elaborate further on both questions: 1) How are capital gains taxed for the lowest tax bracket? Capital gains tax is applied to the profit made from selling or exchanging investment assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. In the United States, capital gains are categorized as either short-term or long-term. Short-term capital gains are realized on assets held for one year or less and are taxed as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are realized on assets held for over a year and are subject to different tax rates. For individuals in the lowest tax bracket (10%-12%), the long-term capital gains tax rate is typically 0%. However, it is crucial to note that tax laws and regulations can vary between countries and specific jurisdictions, and this information pertains to the U.S. tax system. In other countries, capital gains taxation can differ significantly. Consult with a tax professional or review your local tax regulations to understand the tax implications fully. 2) Who has the coolest corporate office building in Pune? Pune, India, is home to numerous tech companies and corporate office buildings, many of which feature state-of-the-art architecture and unique designs. It's difficult to definitively declare which corporate office building is the \\"coolest,\\" as different people will have varied preferences and opinions. However, some noteworthy corporate office buildings in Pune include: - Infosys: Located in the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park, Hinjewadi, the Infosys campus in Pune is known for its impressive architecture and vast, well-maintained campus. The sprawling complex features landscaped gardens, modern glass buildings, and various amenities for employees. - TCS - Tata Consultancy Services: TCS Sahyadri Park in Pune is another striking office building with a modern design and futuristic architectural elements.

News article: Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) Families are nervously awaiting news of 12 missing boys and their soccer coach Tuesday as rescuers search a partially flooded cave complex in northern Thailand where the group is thought to have been trapped since the weekend. Most of the boys' parents are at a makeshift camp near the Tham Luang Nang Non caves and have not left the area since they learned their children were missing on Saturday. \\"I feel I have just lost my heart because I just found his bag, mobile phone and his shoes. But all I can do is just wait,\\" said Sudsakorn Sudtham, 35, whose son, Prajak, is 14. The parents of the missing boys have been at the site near Chiang Rai since Saturday. The group, all belonging to the same soccer team from the nearby city of Chiang Rai, have been missing since 1 p.m. Saturday when a park officer spotted something amiss -- bicycles parked idly by the entrance to the cave despite it being off-limits. They are believed to have crawled into the large series of caves through a narrow, 15-meter-long (50-foot) channel. Another anxious parent, Pinyo Bhodhi, 37, said he became worried when his son, Pipat, 15, hadn't returned home Saturday evening -- the day before his birthday. He told CNN he'd arranged a party and a cake for Pipat, a keen soccer player who \\"trains every day\\" and has dreams of being on the Thai national team, on Saturday night. When Pipat failed to come home, his father started calling around to his son's friends, teammates and coaches. \\"It was already 7 (or) 8 p.m. and he hadn't returned home, (so) I started to look for him.\\" Soccer shoes are left next to bikes from the missing boys at the entrance of a cave in northern Thailand. When he learned of the boys' disappearance at the caves, he rushed to the scene near Chiang Rai and has been waiting there since Saturday night. He said he discovered his son's bike outside the cave. \\"When I saw his bike parked inside at the cave, my tears were just dropping. I was desperate to find my son. \\"We need a miracle. I want him back.\\" He was looking forward to seeing his son blow out candles on his birthday cake, but now \\"the cake remains at home.\\" Pumps used to drain water from cave complex The families sit and wait as rescuers battle heavy rains to search the flooded system of caves where the group is thought to be trapped. Emergency services are attempting to pump water out of the cave complex after the rain flooded the caves and the passages that link them. Rescue teams gather Monday in a deep cave where the group of boys went missing. \\"We (are) drawing out water from the cave, and we're (currently) looking for more water pumps\\" and long cables with which to power the pumps, said Kamolchai Kotcha, an official with Thailand's national parks authority. A team of Thai Royal Navy SEAL divers, who re-entered the cave complex early Tuesday, haven't found any trace of the children or their coach, Kotcha told CNN by phone. A bicycle belonging to one of the missing boys is seen outside the cave complex. However, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said that the government had not ruled out hope of finding the boys and the coach alive. \\"We are still optimistic they are all alive. Even though they may not have anything to eat, they should have water to drink.\\" Vernon Unsworth, a spelunker who lives in Chiang Rai, said the conditions in the cave are difficult. \\"The water is rising all the time. Physically it's not a hard cave; it's just very long,\\" he told CNN from the rescue site. \\"I think we just have to wait for the navy SEALs to see what they can do, how far they can go. The conditions further on will not be easy so we just have to wait and (keep our) fingers crossed.\\" He said a big pool of water is continually rising in a section of the cave about 3 kilometers (1.7 miles) from the entrance. The \\"next six to eight hours will be crucial,\\" he said. Kotcha of the national parks authority said around 40 chambers are inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, \\"both small and big ones.\\" Rescuers suspect the missing boys are still in the main chamber of the cave. Thai Interior Minister General Anupong Paochinda said the divers could only work intermittently due to the restrictions of their equipment. He said the rescue team was trying to reduce the water level to prevent it from \\"reaching the ceiling of the passage\\" so there's an air pocket for the rescuers. \\"The water is muddy; it has also still blocked the passage (into the chamber). The SEALs have switched from using (an) oxygen tank to a closed-circuit system,\\" which allows them to dive up to three hours at a time. \\"We are arranging more water pumps and electricity cable to drain water. Hopefully we can create some space (at the passage) for them.\\" Kotcha said the team is waiting for updates from the SEALs, who are trying to get through the flooded channel. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Navy divers have been sent in to help look for the missing teenagers Thailand's deputy PM has said he is optimistic a group of young footballers trapped inside a cave are still alive, as the search enters a third day.

One such expression is to touch all bases. There are four bases in baseball - first, second, third and home plate. When a baseball player hits the ball, he must run to each base - in order - and touch it with his foot. It is the only way to get a point. If the player hits the ball and fails to touch all the bases, the point will not be counted. The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. Hank Aaron was a player with the Atlanta Braves team. He was trying to find the record for hitting the most home runs . Aaron needed just one home run to be well matched with the record held by Babe Ruth, the greatest hitter in baseball history. Aaron got that home run the very first time he had a chance to hit the ball. That gave him 714 home runs - the same as Babe Ruth. After that day, baseball fans held their breath every time when it was Hank Aaron's turn to hit. When would he hit home run number 715? The wait was not long. In the second week of the season, Aaron again hit the ball over the wall. He had beaten Babe Ruth's record. But first, he had to run around the four bases. The other players on his team watched carefully to make sure he touched each one. So, to touch all bases means to do what is necessary to complete an activity. The expression is used to business and politics. No business deal or political events are really complete until you discuss all the problems involved. Or, as it is said, until you touch all bases. Question: When was the importance of touching all the bases shown? Answer: A:","completion":"The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball season. This fact was prominently demonstrated through the situation involving Hank Aaron, a player with the Atlanta Braves team. At that time, Aaron was vying to set a new record for the most home runs, a record then held by Babe Ruth. He successfully tied with Ruth's record when he hit his 714th home run, but to officially beat the record, Aaron needed to touch all four bases after hitting the ball over the wall. On that day, Aaron hit his 715th home run but had to run around the four bases - first, second, third and home plate, to have his point counted and validate his record-setting achievement. As he ran, his teammates watched keenly to make certain he completed the necessary process. This incident marked a significant illustration of the phrase \\"to touch all bases,\\" reinforcing the notion that to complete an activity, one must follow through all its necessary steps, just like a baseball player has to touch all the bases to score a point. The phrase has since extended beyond baseball and infiltrated the realms of business and politics, where it emphasizes the importance of thoroughness and handling all aspects or issues related to a situation or transaction. Thus, the 1974 baseball season was a keystone year that emphasized the critical importance of \\"touching all the bases\\" both in sports and in wider life settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A degree (in full, a degree of arc, arc degree, or arcdegree), usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol), is a measurement of a plane angle, defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees. It is not an SI unit, as the SI unit of angular measure is the radian, but it is mentioned in the SI brochure as an accepted unit. Because a full rotation equals 2 radians, one degree is equivalent to radians. The original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown. One theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year. Ancient astronomers noticed that the sun, which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year, seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day. Some ancient calendars, such as the Persian calendar, used 360 days for a year. The use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers. Another theory is that the Babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system. The earliest trigonometry, used by the Babylonian astronomers and their Greek successors, was based on chords of a circle. A chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity. One sixtieth of this, using their standard sexagesimal divisions, was a degree. 1. What is degree short for? 2. What is is used for? 3. What is its maximum value? 4.

Q:Polar bears are born in dens on land and their mother stays with them for the whole winter without eating anything. The mother and the babies come out from the dens around March, _ from a long winter and must immediately go hunting to find food to stay alive. Now, the only hunting they know is to catch seals from floating ice in the open ocean. In March, polar bear mothers and babies have to swim from the land in Spitsbergen to the edge of the polar ice cap. Normally this is a short swim, since in March the polar ice cap is very close to the land, and the polar bears, and even the babies, are good swimmers. However, last year we saw that the polar ice cap had become smaller in size due to global warming. Swimming hundreds of miles, especially when they are hungry and have babies following them, is really hard, and many bears are dying because of starvation. The polar bear population in the Spitsbergen area was once threatened by hunters. In the 1970s, a ban on hunting was imposed and the polar bear population has been steadily increasing from just a few hundred to about 2,000 to 3,000. This was a great success story. However, now, because of global warming, the population is again in danger. If we do not stop making so much carbon dioxide, we will lose these beautiful animals forever. The polar bears are just one example of animals that have become endangered because of man's appetite for energy obtained by burning fossil fuels. All life on earth could be in danger unless we change our ways. What can we do? To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air we must save and make energy without burning coal and oil. Instead, we can use the sun or the wind to generate electricity. We must also cut down on needless driving and turn off things that use electricity when we are not using them. In addition, we have to stop cutting down forests and start planting more trees. Now that the polar ice cap is smaller, _ .

He is best known as the lead singer and main lyricist of the alternative rock band R.E.M. from their formation in 1980 until their dissolution in 2011. Possessing a distinctive voice, Stipe is noted for the \\"mumbling\\" style of his early career as well as for his social and political activism. He was in charge of R.E.M.'s visual aspect, often selecting album artwork and directing many of the band's music videos. In 1983, Stipe met fellow musician Natalie Merchant of the band 10,000 Maniacs; the two started a friendship, and eventually became \\"lovers\\" for a period of time. With the success of the albums Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), R.E.M. became mainstream music stars. Around 1992, rumors that Stipe had contracted HIV began to circulate. He responded with: Not that I can tell. I wore a hat that said \\"White House Stop AIDS\\". I'm skinny. I've always been skinny, except in 1985 when I looked like Marlon Brando, the last time I shaved my head. I was really sick then. Eating potatoes. I think AIDS hysteria would obviously and naturally extend to people who are media figures and anybody of indecipherable or unpronounced sexuality. Anybody who looks gaunt, for whatever reason. Anybody who is associated, for whatever reason - whether it's a hat, or the way I carry myself - as being queer-friendly. In 1994, with questions remaining, Stipe described himself as \\"an equal opportunity lech\\", and said he did not define himself as gay, straight, or bisexual, but that he was attracted to, and had relationships with, both men and women. In 1995, he appeared on the cover of Out magazine. Stipe described himself as a \\"queer artist\\" in Time in 2001 and revealed that he had been in a relationship with \\"an amazing man\\" for three years at that point. Stipe reiterated this in a 2004 interview with Butt magazine. When asked if he ever declares himself as gay, Stipe stated, \\"I don't. I think there's a line drawn between gay and queer, and for me, queer describes something that's more inclusive of the grey areas.\\" In 1999, author Douglas A. Martin published a novel, Outline of My Lover, in which the narrator has a six-year romantic relationship with the unnamed lead singer of a successful Athens, Georgia-based, rock band; the book was widely speculated, and later confirmed by its author, to have been a roman a clef based on a real relationship between Martin and Stipe. The two had previously collaborated on two books, both in 1998: The Haiku Year (for which the two had both contributed haiku) and Martin's book of poetry Servicing the Salamander (for which Stipe took the cover photograph).

Most Japanese people dress fairly similarly to westerners so you won’t have to worry about buying specific clothes for your trip. However, Japanese culture places a slightly higher premium on professional attire in public places than exists in the west. Err towards packing and wearing your nicer clothing. Adult men generally don’t wear shorts in Japan, even in hotter weather. Expectations for women to dress modestly are slightly higher in Japan than in the west. Japanese women usually cover their shoulders and avoid form-fitting clothes. However, this expectation is less present in major cities like Tokyo. Flip-flops are not commonly worn in public in Japan. It won’t be considered rude but you may get strange looks. Body language signals are more intentional and universally understood in Japan than in most western cultures. A subtle nod, smile or placement of your hands can drastically change the meaning of your words. While Japanese people used to dealing with westerners will understand if you haven’t totally mastered these signals, there are some body language signals that could be considered rude. Try to keep your back straight at all times. Slouching while sitting or leaning against a wall while standing is considered rude and dismissive of your companions. Don’t keep your hands in your pockets during a conversation. Point with your hand, not your finger. Pointing with a finger can be considered as an insult or even a threat. Japanese people are very conscientious about spreading germs. This is especially true in major cities like Tokyo because a lot of public places are very crowded and contagious illness can spread easily. Don’t blow your nose in public places. Find a bathroom instead. Cough into the crook of your arm rather than your hand so you cover more of your mouth. If you have a cold, wearing a surgical mask so you don’t get others sick is considered polite. Japanese people generally like to leave a bit more space between them during conversations. Try to leave enough space so that if both conversants were to bow at the same time, there would be no risk of bumping heads. Touching is generally discouraged and can be perceived as overly familiar or aggressive. This includes common and benign western actions like patting someone’s shoulder. Bowing is the most common form of nonverbal communication. While bowing conventions are fairly elaborate, using two types of bows should suffice for a visitor. A deep bow is often used when apologizing or meeting someone of a higher station. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist. Bend far enough so that your face is pointing toward the floor and hold the position for at least 2 full seconds before returning to the upright position. You should definitely perform a deep bow for an employer or anyone you deem to be particularly prestigious. Anyone that is substantially older than you is considered to be of higher station as well. A smaller bow is considered, to some extent, the equivalent of a handshake. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist and return to your starting position quickly. It is proper for meeting people of similar age or station. Summary:","completion":"When visiting Japan, dress modestly, follow cultural etiquette regarding body language and personal space, and adhere to hygiene practices that prevent spreading germs, while familiarizing yourself with basic bowing techniques for various social interactions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - The House of Lancaster was the name of two cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons' War. When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's sonEdward III of England. - Edward III (13 November 1312 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, Edward II. Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of fifty years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and governmentin particular the evolution of the English parliamentas well as the ravages of the Black Death. - In history and heraldry, a cadet branch consists of the male-line descendants of a monarch or patriarch's younger sons (cadets). In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assetsrealm, titles, fiefs, property and incomehave historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sonscadetsinherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants. - Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, \\"jure uxoris\\" 4th Earl of Ulster and 5th Baron of Connaught, KG (29 November 13387 October 1368) was the third son, but the second son to survive infancy, of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was named for his birthplace, at Antwerp in the Duchy of Brabant. Prince Lionel was born of a Flemish mother and was a grandson of William I, Count of Hainaut. He grew to be nearly seven feet in height and had an athletic build. - The House of York was a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet . Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century . The House of York was descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley , 1st Duke of York , the fourth surviving son of Edward III , but also represented Edward 's senior line , being cognatic descendants of Lionel , Duke of Clarence , Edward III 's second surviving son . It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown . Compared with the House of Lancaster , it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture . The reign of this dynasty ended with the death of Richard III of England in 1485 . It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet , 17th Earl of Warwick in 1499 . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The House of Plantagenet was a royal house which originated from the lands of Anjou in France. The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses the Angevins who were also Counts of Anjou, the main body of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou, and the houses of Lancaster and York, the Plantagenets' two cadet branches. The family held the English throne from 1154, with the accession of Henry II, until 1485, when Richard III died. - Kings Langley Palace was a 13th-century Royal Palace which was located to the west of the Hertfordshire village of Kings Langley in England. During the Middle Ages, the palace served as a residence of the Plantagenet kings of England. It fell into disuse sometime during the 16th century and became a ruin. Today, nothing remains of the building except for some archaeological remains. The site is a scheduled ancient monument. - The Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Since the 15th century, it has, when granted, usually been given to the second son of English (later British) monarchs. The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, (5 June 1341 1 August 1402) was the fourth surviving son of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Like many medieval English princes, Edmund gained his nickname from his birthplace: Kings Langley Palace in Hertfordshire. He was the founder of the House of York, but it was through the marriage of his younger son, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, to Anne de Mortimer, great-granddaughter of Edmund's elder brother Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, that the House of York made its claim to the English throne in the Wars of the Roses. The other party in the Wars of the Roses, the incumbent House of Lancaster, was formed from descendants of Edmund's elder brother John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, Edward III's third son. - The title of Earl of Cambridge was created several times in the Peerage of England, and since 1362 the title has been closely associated with the Royal family (see also Duke of Cambridge, Marquess of Cambridge). - Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick (25 February 1475 28 November 1499) was the son of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and a potential claimant to the English throne during the reigns of both Richard III (14831485) and his successor, Henry VII (14851509). He was also a younger brother of Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury. - Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester ( 4 August 1265), also called Simon de Munford and sometimes referred to as Simon V de Montfort to distinguish him from other Simons de Montfort, was a French-English nobleman who inherited the title and estates of the earldom of Leicester in England. He led the rebellion against King Henry III of England during the Second Barons' War of 126364, and subsequently became \\"de facto\\" ruler of England. During his rule, Montfort called two famous parliaments. The first stripped the King of unlimited authority, while the second included ordinary citizens from the towns. For this reason, Montfort is regarded today as one of the progenitors of modern parliamentary democracy. After a rule of just over a year, Montfort was killed by forces loyal to the King in the Battle of Evesham. - Thomas, Earl of Leicester and Lancaster (c. 1278 22 March 1322) was an English nobleman. A junior member of the House of Plantagenet, he was one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to his first cousin, Edward II of England. - Edmund Crouchback (16 January 1245 5 June 1296), a member of the House of Plantagenet, was the second surviving son of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence. In his childhood he had a claim on the Kingdom of Sicily, but he never ruled there. In 1265 he was granted all the lands of Simon de Montfort and from 1267 he was titled Earl of Leicester. In that year he also began to rule Lancashire, but he did not take the title Earl of Lancaster until 1276. Between 1276 and 1284 he governed the counties of Champagne and Brie with his second wife, Blanche of Artois, in the name of her daughter Joan. His nickname, \\"Crouchback\\" (meaning \\"crossed-back\\"), refers to his participation in the Ninth Crusade. - Earl of Warwick is a title that has been created four times in English history and is one of the most prestigious titles in the peerages of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in 1088, and was held by the Beaumont, and later by the Beauchamp families. The 14th Earl was created Duke of Warwick in 1445, a title which became extinct on his early death the following year. The best-known Earl of this creation was the 16th Earl, who was involved in the deposition of two kings, a fact which later earned him his epithet \\"Warwick the Kingmaker\\". This creation became extinct on the death of the 17th Earl in 1499. The title was revived in 1547 for the powerful statesman John Dudley, 1st Viscount Lisle, who was later made Duke of Northumberland. The earldom was passed on during his lifetime to his eldest son, John, but both father and son were attainted in 1554. The title was recreated or restored in 1561 in favour of Ambrose, younger son of the Duke of Northumberland. However, Ambrose was childless and the earldom became extinct on his death in 1590. It was created for a third time in 1618 for Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich, in spite of the fact that the Rich family were not in possession of Warwick Castle. From 1673 the Earls also held the title Earl of Holland. All the titles became extinct on the death of the 8th Earl in 1759. The earldom was revived the same year in favour of Francis Greville, 1st Earl Brooke. The Greville family were in possession of Warwick Castle and the title and castle were thereby re-united for the first time in over a century. The 1759 creation is extant and currently held by Guy Greville, 9th Earl of Warwick. However, Warwick Castle was sold by the family in 1978, and they currently live in Australia. - Anjou is an historical and cultural region of France, a former French county (in that it was ruled by a count, from ), duchy (1360), and province. Its capital was the city of Angers in the lower Loire Valley. The territory has no very clear geographical borders but instead owes its territory and prominence to the fortunes of its various rulers. - Philippa of Hainault (24 June 1314 15 August 1369) was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward III. Edward, Duke of Guyenne, her future husband, promised in 1326 to marry her within the following two years. She was married to Edward, first by proxy, when Edward dispatched the Bishop of Coventry \\"to marry her in his name\\" in Valenciennes (second city in importance of the county of Hainaut) in October 1327. The marriage was celebrated formally in York Minster on 24 January 1328, some months after Edward's accession to the throne of England. In August 1328, he also fixed his wife's dower. - The Second Barons' War (12641267) was a civil war in England between the forces of a number of barons led by Simon de Montfort against Royalist forces led by Prince Edward (later Edward I of England), in the name of Henry III. - Richard III (2 October 1452 22 August 1485) was King of England from 1483 until his death in 1485, at the age of 32, in the Battle of Bosworth Field. He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. His defeat at Bosworth Field, the last decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses, marked the end of the Middle Ages in England. He is the subject of the historical play \\"Richard III\\" by William Shakespeare. - John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, (6 March 1340 3 February 1399) was a member of the House of Plantagenet, the third of five surviving sons of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was called \\"John of Gaunt\\" because he was born in Ghent, then rendered in English as \\"Gaunt\\". When he became unpopular later in life, scurrilous rumours and lampoons circulated that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher, perhaps because Edward III was not present at the birth. This story always drove him to fury. - The Peerage of the United Kingdom comprises most peerages created in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the Act of Union in 1801, when it replaced the Peerage of Great Britain. New peers continued to be created in the Peerage of Ireland until 1898 (the last creation being the Barony of Curzon of Kedleston). Ranks. The ranks of the peerage are duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. - The Battle of Bosworth Field (or Battle of Bosworth) was the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, the civil war between the Houses of Lancaster and York that raged across England in the latter half of the 15th century. Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, by his victory became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty. His opponent, Richard III, the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history. - The title Earl of Leicester (pronounced ) was created in the 12th century in the Peerage of England (now extinct), and is currently a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1837. - Edward II (25 April 1284 21 September 1327), also called Edward of Caernarfon, was King of England from 1307 until he was deposed in January 1327. The fourth son of Edward I, Edward became the heir to the throne following the death of his older brother Alphonso. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on campaigns to pacify Scotland, and in 1306 he was knighted in a grand ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307, following his father's death. In 1308, he married Isabella of France, the daughter of the powerful King Philip IV, as part of a long-running effort to resolve the tensions between the English and French crowns. - Henry III (1 October 1207 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\".

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that gave Jules Massenet his first piano lessons? Massenet was born at Montaud, then an outlying hamlet and now a part of the city of Saint-Étienne, in the Loire. He was the youngest of the four children of Alexis Massenet (1788–1863) and his second wife Eléonore-Adelaïde née Royer de Marancour (1809–1875); the elder children were Julie, Léon and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Massenet was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lycée in tandem with his musical studies. Ambroise Thomas, my beloved master, came towards me and said, \\"Embrace Berlioz, you owe him a great deal for your prize.\\" \\"The prize,\\" I cried, bewildered, my face shining with joy. \\"I have the prize!!!\\" I was deeply moved and I embraced Berlioz, then my master, and finally Monsieur Auber. Monsieur Auber comforted me. Did I need comforting? Then he said to Berlioz pointing to me, \\"He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience!\\" The prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from...

Movie title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Movie plot: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a film by Richard Fleischer based on the famous Jules Verne novel written in the 19th century. The film begins with the first page of the book, talking about rumors of a mysterious sea monster that prowled the South Seas in 1868. The camera switches to an old-fashioned ship sailing through apparently calm seas. A long, dark object with glowing lights like eyes at its head appears a short distance away from the ship. It drives straight toward the ship, making a loud whirring noise of a motor. It collides head-on with the ship, sinking it, and sails off. A man standing before a crowd in San Francisco offers a bonus to any man who will ship with an expedition to hunt the mysterious \\"monster\\". Another man interrupts him, warning the crowd not to sign; they will never make it back to collect their pay. He brings up an elderly seaman who tells a dramatic story of how the \\"monster\\" sunk the ship he was on, and proceeds to give a vivid description of the monster. A young sailor, Ned Land, challenges the old sailor's claim and makes fun of the way his breath smells. His companion, Casey, hits him over the head with the sailor's cane and a fight breaks out. The police arrive and drag Ned Land away. Farther down the street, French professor Pierre Aronnax and his apprentice, Conseil, are trying to find a ship that will take them to Saigon, but are told that no one will sail through the South Seas. Three reporters ask for a statement from the professor about the monster, but he gives them an ambiguous answer. Back at their apartments, Aronnax reads the paper and sees that the reporters wildly misquoted him, claiming that he believes in a huge seamonster.

As the film progresses, Aronnax shifts his focus to finding and understanding the sea monster, which turns out to be the futuristic submarine Nautilus, commanded by the enigmatic Captain Nemo. Upon discovering that the \\"monster\\" is actually a man-made creation, Aronnax, Conseil, and the sailor Ned Land find themselves on an adventure while onboard the Nautilus, exploring the depths of the ocean and encountering various wonders and dangers.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Answer:","completion":"Question: What can be inferred about John Styth Pemberton and the creation of Coca-Cola based on the article?

C) Coca-Cola was immediately successful and widely consumed as a beverage upon its creation, with no focus on any medical cures or benefits. D) Frank M.

Answer the question: When you use more force to move a car it will move less or move further? Answer:","completion":"When you use more force to move a car, it will generally move further. This principle can be explained using Newton's second law of motion, which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, the law can be expressed as: F = m * a Where F is the net force acting on the object, m is its mass, and a is its acceleration. If you apply more force (F) to a car, the acceleration (a) will increase, considering that the mass (m) of the car remains constant. With greater acceleration, the car will cover a longer distance in the same amount of time, causing it to move further. It is essential to note that friction between the car tires and the ground, as well as air resistance, might affect the car's movement. However, in general, a greater force applied to the car will result in it moving further."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In German, we need to preserve this structure as well, so we translate it into \\"Freitags, samstags und an Abenden vor gesetzlichen Feiertagen\\". Here, \\"Freitag\\" means \\"Friday\\", \\"Samstag\\" means \\"Saturday\\", \\"Abenden\\" means \\"nights\\", \\"vor\\" means \\"before\\", and \\"gesetzlichen Feiertagen\\" means \\"public holidays\\". 2. \\"there is\\" - This part of the sentence needs to be translated into \\"gibt es\\", which is a common German phrase for \\"there is/are\\". 3. \\"a single S-Bahn on each line\\" - We now need to translate the noun phrase that describes the subject of the sentence. In German, it becomes \\"eine einzelne S-Bahn auf jeder Linie\\". Here, \\"eine\\" means \\"a\\", \\"einzelne\\" means \\"single\\", \\"jeder\\" means \\"each\\", and \\"Linie\\" means \\"line\\". 4. \\"between 2:30AM and 3AM\\" - The last part of the sentence gives specific information about the time.

A. michigan B. map C. american city D. rest stops E. country The best answer is Answer:","completion":"C. American City An expressway can suffer from traffic, and this traffic tends to get worse the closer you get to any American city. The reason for this is that cities are naturally dense urban areas with high populations and economic activities. As a result, the infrastructure in and around the city, such as roads and highways, experience a higher volume of traffic due to the large number of people commuting to work, traveling for leisure, or running errands. One of the main reasons why traffic worsens when approaching an American city can be attributed to the fact that cities act as central hubs for economic, social, and administrative functions. This means that they draw people in from surrounding areas, leading to significant traffic congestion during peak travel times. Additionally, cities are characterized by a high number of intersections, traffic lights, and road signs—all of which are designed to accommodate the elevated vehicle volumes. However, many of these traffic control measures can result in delays and frustrations for motorists. Furthermore, limited availability of parking space in urban centers can exacerbate the problem, as drivers circle around looking for a spot to park, adding to overall traffic congestion. Some cities are also well-known for having a large number of tourists and visitors, which adds to the total number of vehicles on the road at any given time. These visitors may not be familiar with the local traffic patterns, roadways, and peak times, thus further contributing to the congestion as they navigate to their destinations. Lastly, expressways themselves can be a reason for the increased traffic when approaching a city. These high-speed roads are designed to connect cities and serve as primary conduits for long-distance travel. Consequently, they attract a high volume of vehicles, and as the expressway gets closer to a city, the number of drivers taking the same route increases, leading to traffic congestion. In conclusion, traffic on expressways tends to get worse the closer one gets to any American city. This is due to the high volumes of people commuting, the centralized economic and social functions of cities, the abundance of tourists and visitors, and the nature of expressways. City planners and transportation agencies continue to explore ways to alleviate and manage traffic congestion through the use of public transportation, alternative routes, and intelligent traffic systems."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

That she knew she was going to see him The answer is:","completion":"Step 1: Defining the main characters In the movie plot, the main characters are Payton, Joe, and Payton's mom. Payton is a teenage girl with a secret, Joe is her best friend, and Payton's mom is a single mother with a mysterious past. Step 2: Establishing the setting The movie will be set in a small coastal town where everyone knows each other and rumors spread quickly. Step 3: Introducing the lie Payton lies to Joe about her mom by telling him that she knew her mom was going to see him. This lie will be the catalyst for the events in the movie plot. Step 4: Developing the movie plot Payton's lie affects Joe greatly as he believes that Payton's mom has some important information to share with him. He gets curious and starts to investigate Payton's mom's past, which only intrigues him even more. Joe uncovers some dark secrets about Payton's mom, and he feels conflicted about whether to share his findings with Payton or keep them to himself to protect his friend. Step 5: Exploring the relationship between Payton and Joe As Joe digs deeper into Payton's mom's past, it affects his friendship with Payton. Payton gets increasingly frustrated with Joe's obsession and tries to deflect his inquiries, but Joe can't let go of his newfound fascination. Step 6: Introducing a twist Just as Joe is about to reach a breakthrough in his investigation, he discovers that Payton has been lying to him all along. In fact, Payton's mom never intended to see Joe, and Payton fabricated the whole story to divert Joe's attention from her own secrets. Step 7: Climax of the movie plot When confronted with the truth, Payton tearfully confesses that she lied because she didn't want Joe to find out about her own past. She had been struggling with a dark family history and was afraid of losing her friend. Joe, surprised and hurt by the revelation, must decide whether to forgive Payton or turn his back on their friendship. Step 8: Resolution Eventually, Joe decides to forgive Payton and helps her confront her past, leading to an emotional catharsis for both characters. Payton's mom acknowledges her painful past and opens up to her daughter, allowing them to rebuild their relationship. In the end, Payton, Joe, and Payton's mom come out of the experience stronger and more connected than ever before. Bringing it all together, the movie plot could be summarized as follows: Payton lies to her best friend Joe about her mom going to see him, which sets Joe on an investigative journey to discover Payton's mom's secrets. As he gets closer to the truth, Joe learns that Payton lied to protect herself from her own dark past. With their friendship tested, Joe must decide whether to forgive Payton and help her confront her past, ultimately leading to healing and reconciliation for all involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H.

A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

The \\"Nihon Shoki\\", finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaido in recorded history.

One of the places Hirafu went to was called , which is often believed to be present-day Hokkaido. However, many theories exist in relation to the details of this event, including the location of Watarishima and the common belief that the Emishi in Watarishima were the ancestors of the present-day Ainu people.

Context: Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Answer:","completion":"C. Airmiles are costly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: A big risk in long-term relationships is taking one another for granted. No matter how much you love and appreciate your spouse, there's always a risk that you might get so accustomed to one another that you forget to be grateful for all that your partner does. If you make an effort to express gratitude, your partner will almost certainly do the same. Say thank you when your spouse does something for you, whether it's cooking a meal, fixing a broken cabinet, or just picking something up for you at the store. Letting your partner know that you appreciate the little things will make your spouse feel appreciated, and your partner will be more likely to continue doing nice things for you (and vice versa) in the future. You could say something like: \\"It made me really happy that you swung by work today - thanks for doing that. It was good to see you for a few minutes.\\" Another facet of taking your partner for granted is forgetting to compliment one another. You may think that your partner knows you love him or her, and that may be true. But nothing brings a smile to your face like hearing that someone finds you attractive and desirable, so work to make one another feel special as often as possible. It doesn't take much to notice your partner. Compliment your spouse on an attractive outfit, a recent haircut, any developments after beginning a new workout routine, and so on. Try to praise your partner for his/her efforts in front of others. Bragging about your spouse's accomplishments when he or she is too shy to can really make your spouse feel loved. As your relationship goes on, you might find that it's harder to make time for a date, or to go out and have a romantic evening alone. This can be particularly troublesome if you have children. But having regular date nights spent alone with your spouse can bring back the excitement and the passion that you felt for one another when you were actually dating, and that passion is important in sustaining a long-term marriage. Commit to spending the night alone together. Get a babysitter for your kids, or have them sleep over at a friend's house. Choose a romantic restaurant. If you have a favorite place to go or if you can recreate your first date, even better. Get dressed up for one another. Try to impress your spouse as though you were still just dating and not yet married. Take a romantic walk after dinner, or go see a show together. Focus on making it an intimate evening alone together. In addition to feeling your sexual needs are fulfilled, it's imperative that you feel like your life has meaning and that you've accomplished something. It may come as a surprise, but experts agree that having your own personal goals and accomplishments separate from your spouse can actually strengthen your marriage. When you feel like your own personal goals are being fulfilled, it's easier to devote yourself to your partner. If you're very career-driven, take time for your career.

Some mutations are harmful. In this case, the organism may not live to reproduce. The trait will not be passed onto offspring. Others variations in traits have no effect on survival. Can some mutations be good for a living thing? Other mutations can have great benefits. Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival.

Article: For a clearer picture of what the student knows, most teachers use another kind of examination in addition to objective tests. They use \\"essay\\" tests, which require students to write long answers to broad, general questions such as the following: \\"Mention several ways in which Benjamin Franklin has influenced thinking of people in his own country and in other parts of the world.\\" One advantage of the essay test is that it reduces the element of luck. The student cannot get a high score just by making a lucky guess. Another advantage is that it shows the examiner more cares about the student's ability to put facts together into a meaningful whole. It should show how deeply he has thought about the subject. Sometimes, though, essay tests have disadvantages, too. Some students are able to write rather good answers without really knowing much about the subject, while other students who actually know the material have trouble expressing their ideas in the essay form. Besides, in an essay test the student's score may depend upon the examiner's feelings at the time of reading the answer. If he is feeling tired or bored, the student may receive a lower score than he should. Another examiner reading the same answer might give it a much higher mark. Because of _ , the objective test gives each student a fairer chance, and of course it is easier and quicker to score. Whether an objective test or an essay test is used, problems arise. When some objective questions are used along with some essay questions, however, a fairly clear picture of the student's knowledge can usually be gotten. Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements about the objective test is NOT true? Options: A: It is more objective than the essay test in terms of scoring. B: It allows the student to guess the correct answer without really knowing the material. C: It shows the student's ability to think about difficult problems. D: It is easy and quick to score.

The man, giving his name as John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), is a brooding, soft spoken man; when Jim passes a stranded car, however, Ryder's personality suddenly shifts. Ryder calmly states that the reason the car is stranded is because he murdered and mutilated the driver, and he intends to do the same to Jim. Ryder produces a switchblade knife and taunts Jim for several moments, before Jim realizes Ryder never put on his seat belt and that the passenger door isn't fully closed and knocks him out of the car.Relieved, Jim continues on his journey, until a station wagon carrying a family on vacation passes, and Jim is horrified to see that Ryder has hitched a ride with them.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. Question: Why was the daughter devestated? Options: A. not enough information B. because she was late for school C. because the dog ate her homework D. because she fell in a sticker bush === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is C. because the dog ate her homework."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Walter Brennan Answer:","completion":"Title: The Colonel's Redemption Genre: Drama, War, History Plot: In the small town of Cedarwood, Kentucky, the once-legendary Colonel Walter Brennan (played by Walter Brennan) resides in anonymity, disconnected from his war-tainted past. Though he was once a highly regarded and heroic military officer, an unfortunate incident during the war turned much of the public against him, tainting his name and legacy. Now in his twilight years, Colonel Brennan seeks solitude and spends his days in a hidden cabin in the woods, away from the prying eyes and the judgment of the town. Jim, a local single father, and his 15-year-old son, Danny, accidentally stumble upon the Colonel's cabin while on a hike. Jim, having once been inspired by the Colonel's heroic tales, recognizes him and strikes up a friendly conversation. Conflict arises when Cedarwood's military base is threatened with closure, which would bring the community to the verge of financial collapse. A desperate Cedarwood mayor pleads for Colonel Brennan's help, seeking to leverage his military connections and expertise to save the town. Initially reluctant, Colonel Brennan is swayed by Jim and Danny's admiration and genuine faith in his abilities. In order to save Cedarwood, Colonel Brennan agrees to train a group of unlikely and inexperienced townspeople to prepare for a decisive military inspection. As the misfit group bands together and overcomes various obstacles, they learn about the importance of unity, persistence, and friendship. Throughout the process, Colonel Brennan bonds with the townspeople, opening up about his previously unknown sacrifices and the truth behind the incident that tarnished his reputation. As the town unearths the truth, they rally behind him, restoring his faith in humanity and his own self-image. Jim and Danny's familial relationship also strengthens, with Jim learning to become a better father through Colonel Brennan's guidance. With the town united and their military rating successfully preserved, Cedarwood successfully avoids the base closure, saving the town from financial disaster. The townspeople celebrate their victory, and Colonel Brennan is finally vindicated and welcomed back into the community with open arms. In the end, Colonel Brennan finds peace and redemption, knowing that he has made a difference in the lives of the people he once served. The Colonel's Redemption is a heartfelt tale of courage, redemption, and the power of community spirit, set against the backdrop of a war hero's journey to regain his honor and identity. Walter Brennan delivers a powerful performance as the titular character, with a compelling storyline that will leave a lasting impression on audiences and transport them to the very heart of heroism and kinship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire, he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, paving the way to German Unification. A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. That territory almost doubled the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union. Question: How many German states remained after Napoleon reduced their numbers?","completion":"After Napoleon dissolved the Holy Roman Empire and reorganized the German states, the number of German states was reduced from around 300 to less than 50.

Write a summary based on this article: Police in India have arrested a man they say was the ringleader of a network of call centers that allegedly swindled thousands of Americans out of millions of dollars. Sagar Thakkar, 24, was detained in Mumbai after arriving on a flight from Dubai on Saturday. \\"He was the mastermind of IRS scam call centers in the state of Maharashtra and one center in Ahmedabad,\\" said Mukund Hatote, assistant commissioner of police in Thane, just north of Mumbai. Hatote said Thakkar stands accused of extortion, cheating, impersonation, criminal conspiracy as well as violating India's communications and tech laws. News of the scam broke last October when Indian police raided nine calls centers -- eight in Thane in Maharashtra -- and arrested more than 70 people on suspicion of posing as IRS agents to steal cash from U.S. citizens. Workers at bogus call centers used American accents to impersonate IRS agents. They told their victims that they owed back taxes and would risk arrest if they hung up or failed to pay up. Thakkar -- also known as \\"Shaggy\\" -- was one of 61 defendants mentioned in a U.S. indictment unsealed last October. The bogus call center workers were accused of stealing from 15,000 people by using the IRS scam and other fraud schemes. Related: IRS impersonators accused of stealing millions from the elderly U.S. prosecutors say the defendants also posed as immigration officers and threatened victims with deportation unless they paid a fine immediately. They said in October that 20 people across eight U.S. states had been arrested. Indian police say they have charged more than 390 people in connection with the scheme, and more than 12 remain in jail. Hatote said Thakkar had been living a \\"lavish lifestyle\\" on the proceeds of the scheme. But it's still not entirely clear how much money was stolen in total. \\"We are still investigating the total amount of money collected by Sagar Thakkar,\\" said Hatote. \\"During the initial stage of investigation, it was looking around 300 million.\\" The mechanics of the operation appear very similar to those of an IRS impersonation scam that U.S. authorities say swindled victims out of more than 15 million between 2013 and 2015. -- Sugam Pohkarel in New Delhi contributed to this article ||||| MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian police said on Saturday they had arrested the suspected mastermind behind a call center scam run out of a Mumbai suburb that targeted thousands of Americans and netted more than 300 million.

In October, the U.S. Justice Department charged more than 60 people in India and the United States with participating in the huge scam where call center agents impersonated Internal Revenue Service, immigration or other federal officials and demanded payments for non-existent debts. The department said at least 15,000 people had been targeted by the telefraud that was run out of India. The scam - which ran for more than a year - was blown open in early October, when Indian police raided a host of call centers in the Mumbai suburb of Thane and detained over 700 people suspected of involvement in defrauding Americans. Other call centers involved in the scam that operated from the western city of Ahmedabad were also raided and shut down by authorities. At a news conference on Saturday evening, Thane Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh said Thakkar, who was charged in December along with others, had fled to Dubai in October following the raids and that he had also spent some time in Thailand over the last six months. Thakkar, wearing blue jeans and a checked shirt, was presented to media on the sidelines of the press conference, but his face was covered with a black cloth. Singh said he had interrogated Thakkar and was “impressed with his knowledge of the U.S. and Indian system.” Singh said Thakkar had confessed to his involvement in the scam. Singh said Thane police have so far charged 400 people in the case, and about a dozen of them are in custody. Thakkar was listed as a call center operator and payment processor in the U.S. Department of Justice indictment that charged the defendants with conspiracy to commit identity theft, false personation of an officer of the United States, wire fraud and money laundering. According to the indictment, call center operators threatened potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay taxes or penalties. Payments by victims were laundered by a U.S. network of co-conspirators using prepaid debit cards or wire transfers, often using stolen or fake identities, the indictment said. U.S. and Indian authorities have been working together on the investigation. The United States had said it would be seeking the extradition of the alleged scamsters based in India. Indian police have previously said that Thakkar led a lavish lifestyle, frequenting five-star hotels and driving around in expensive cars. ||||| Photo MUMBAI — The police on Saturday detained a 24-year-old man suspected of running a multimillion-dollar fraud from a network of Indian call centers, tricking hundreds of unwitting Americans into believing they owed money to the Internal Revenue Service. Sagar Thakkar, known as Shaggy, was apprehended by immigration officials in Mumbai after arriving on a flight from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where the police said he had been living since an October raid on his call centers. He was charged with extortion, cheating by impersonation and wire fraud, and is expected to remain in custody until April 15. Mr. Thakkar’s lawyer could not be reached on Saturday. Officials accuse Mr. Thakkar of leveraging India’s vast supply of tech-savvy, English-speaking workers and modern communications technology to earn as much as 150,000 a day at the height of the fraud. Many of Mr. Thakkar’s nearly 700 young employees would call United States citizens, impersonate I.R.S. agents and demand immediate payment for unpaid taxes. The police estimated that he may have bilked Americans out of 100 million over the telephone.

They believe an informer tipped him off to the raid, said Abhishek Trimukhe, the deputy commissioner of police in Thane. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Indian police have arrested Sagar Thakkar, the suspected ringleader of call centres which allegedly defrauded thousands of Americans out of a total of millions of dollars.

The Associated Press reported the unusual incident, which has since gone viral on social media. The surveillance camera footage from the gym shows the man entering the establishment and arguing with the receptionist before deciding to jump over the turnstile. His decision to target this particular gym soon proved to be ill-advised, as he quickly realized he had made the wrong choice. Merely seconds after leaping over the turnstile, the man was seen jumping back and making a run for it. Hot on his heels was a group of jiujitsu students clad in their uniforms, ready to put their martial arts skills to the test. Jiujitsu teacher Edgar Neto told the press that the incident happened on Monday night and that it was promptly reported to the police. Although the would-be thief managed to escape the grasp of the martial arts students, it is said that he lost one of his sandals during the chase, which the police have since recovered. As of Wednesday, the police stated that the man had not yet been arrested, but the investigation remains ongoing. The incident serves as a stark reminder that not every fitness establishment is an ideal target for a robbery attempt. In this case, picking a gym full of skilled martial artists proved to be a colossal mistake for the would-be thief. The power of teamwork and self-defense training was certainly on display as the students banded together to foil the robbery and protect their gym."},{"prompt":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: watch this!!!!!!!! its excellent hysterical and pretty much true to life .I have to write 8 more words which is ridiculous :) Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the user would recommend this product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These can vary depending on individual team preferences, but some common systems and formations in field hockey include: 1. 4-3-3 Formation: This formation consists of four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. It is a balanced formation that provides strong defense and attacking options. 2. 4-4-2 Formation: This formation is structured with four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards. It allows for a strong midfield presence, supporting both defensive and offensive efforts. 3. 3-4-3 Formation: This formation has three defenders, four midfielders, and three forwards. It is more aggressive and offensive-focused, often utilized by teams with strong attacking players. 4. 5-3-2 Formation: This formation includes five defenders, three midfielders, and two forwards. It is a more defensively-minded system, prioritizing stability at the back while still providing some attacking options. In addition to formations, field hockey systems also cover strategies like attacking plays, defensive tactics, penalty corners, counterattacks, and set pieces.

The Limehouse Declaration was a statement issued on 25 January 1981 by four senior British Labour politicians, all MPs or former MPs and Cabinet Ministers: Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams. It became known as the Limehouse Declaration as it was made from David Owen's London home in Limehouse. Can we infer the following? The Limehouse Declaration was issued the year after 1979.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the Limehouse Declaration was issued the year after 1979, as it was issued on 25 January 1981. The declaration came about as a response to the growing dissatisfaction among certain Labour politicians with the direction of their party. These politicians, Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers, and Shirley Williams, decided to issue a public statement outlining their concerns and proposing a new political approach. The Limehouse Declaration ultimately led to the formation of a centrist political party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The declaration criticized the Labour Party leadership and policies, including its focus on nationalization, unilateral nuclear disarmament, and its then-recently enacted electoral college system, which the \\"Gang of Four\\" believed gave undue influence to trade unions. The politicians who issued the Limehouse Declaration believed that the Labour Party had moved too far to the left and that a new political force was needed to represent those who felt disenfranchised by this shift. They hoped that the SDP would be able to break the mold of the two-party system in the United Kingdom and offer an alternative for voters who did not feel represented by either the Labour Party or the Conservative Party. The SDP, along with the Liberal Party, eventually formed the SDP-Liberal Alliance, which contested the 1983 and 1987 General Elections. The Alliance achieved significant electoral success in terms of vote share but was not able to translate that success into a substantial number of parliamentary seats, largely due to the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system. In 1988, the SDP and Liberal Party merged to form the Liberal Democrats, who continue to operate as a significant, albeit smaller, political force in the UK today. To summarize, the Limehouse Declaration was issued on 25 January 1981, a little over a year after 1979, and marked the beginning of a new political movement in the United Kingdom that aimed to create a centrist alternative to the dominant Labour and Conservative Parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"The United States looks to control the global economy through threat of sanctions.\\"?","completion":"The assertion that \\"the United States should reverse its imperial laissez-faire policies and take an active hand in the global economy\\" might lead to an increased role for the United States in shaping global economic policies. However, to conclude that this implies the United States looks to control the global economy through the threat of sanctions is an oversimplification of the situation. Firstly, it is essential to define imperial laissez-faire policies and an active hand in the global economy. Imperial laissez-faire policies refer to a minimal or non-interventionist approach by a powerful country (like the United States) in managing the affairs of other less powerful countries. Taking an active hand in the global economy, on the other hand, would involve the United States having a more significant role in setting and enforcing international economic policies, engaging in international trade negotiations, providing financial aid and support to developing nations, and participating actively in international organizations that shape global economic policies. Now, to examine the relationship between taking an active hand in the global economy and the assertion that the United States looks to control the global economy through the threat of sanctions: 1. Using sanctions is only one of many tools in shaping global economic policies: Economic sanctions are a powerful diplomatic tool that can be used by a nation to achieve specific foreign policy objectives. However, this does not mean that sanctions are the only means or primary focus of a nation's overall economic policy. By taking an active hand in global economic affairs, the United States can employ various other approaches, such as diplomacy, multilateral agreements, and foreign aid, to achieve its objectives and maintain a stable and prosperous global economy. 2. Sanctions can be an effective deterrent: While the threat of sanctions can be seen as a method of control, they can deter nations from engaging in undesirable behaviors that threaten international security or violate human rights. However, this does not necessarily mean that the United States' primary goal is to control the global economy. Instead, the United States may use sanction threats as a way to ensure stability and maintain international norms. 3. Context and objectives matter: When discussing the role of sanctions in global economic policies, it is essential to consider the specific contexts and objectives involved. In some cases, sanctions may be a last resort after diplomatic efforts have failed or when dealing with a pressing security concern. In such instances, the decision to impose sanctions may be more about protecting national and international interests rather than gaining control over the global economy. 4. Importance of multilateralism: Despite the United States' significant economic and political power, it is crucial to recognize that in many instances, international economic policies and decisions are shaped through a multilateral process, with multiple nations and organizations participating in the decision-making process. In such cases, the United States has to work cooperatively with other countries to achieve shared economic goals, limiting the extent to which it can unilaterally control the global economy. 5. Negative consequences of over-reliance on sanctions: It is also worth noting that over-relying on sanctions can have negative consequences for the United States itself, such as damaging its international reputation, harming its own business interests, or isolating the nation from global economic opportunities. This suggests that the United States would likely pursue a more balanced approach in its global economic policymaking, employing a combination of sanctions and other diplomatic tools. In conclusion, while the United States taking a more active hand in global economic affairs might involve the strategic use of sanctions, it would be an oversimplification to assert that the primary objective is controlling the global economy through the threats of sanctions alone. Instead, the United States may adopt a more comprehensive and nuanced approach, incorporating diplomacy, multilateral cooperation, foreign aid, and, when necessary, sanctions to achieve its global economic policy objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: three asian people standing on a sidewalk with a street scene in the background Hypothesis: Three people are standing and having a conversation in a big city with traffic behind them. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis could be accurate, though we cannot conclusively state that the hypothesis is completely true without further information and context. The premise describes three Asian people standing on a sidewalk with a street scene in the background, which allows us to analyze both the subjects and the setting they are in. Let us break down the hypothesis into its components and correlate them with the given premise: 1. 'Three people are standing': The premise mentions three Asian people standing on a sidewalk, which aligns with this part of the hypothesis. 2. 'Having a conversation': The premise does not explicitly state that the individuals are engaged in conversation. While it is plausible that they are conversing, it is not possible to conclusively claim this without further evidence. 3. 'In a big city': The mention of a street scene in the background suggests an urban setting, which could indicate that the individuals are in a city. However, it is not possible to definitively confirm the size of the city (big or small) based on the premise alone. The term \\"big city\\" generally implies a densely populated urban area with a significant amount of traffic, commercial activity, and infrastructure. While the presence of a street scene could support the hypothesis, it does not definitively confirm it. 4. 'With traffic behind them': The premise mentions a street scene in the background, which could include traffic. However, the description provided is not specific enough to determine the extent of the traffic or if there is any traffic at all. In summary, while the hypothesis appears to be reasonable based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entirely true due to the lack of explicit information about certain aspects, such as the individuals conversing, the size of the city, and the presence of traffic.

The Netherlands has the oldest stock exchange in the world, founded in 1602 by the Dutch East India Company. While Rotterdam has the oldest bourse in the Netherlands, the world's first stock exchange – that of the Dutch East-India Company – went public in six different cities. Later, a court ruled that the company had to reside legally in a single city, so Amsterdam is recognized as the oldest such institution based on modern trading principles.

The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Ulcinj (Montenegrin Cyrillic: , ; Albanian: \\"Ulqini\\") is a town and former bishopric on the southern coast of Montenegro and the capital of Ulcinj Municipality.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Question: suppose a person does heavy exercise happens, how will it affect more glucagon is released. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"When a person engages in heavy exercise, the body needs extra fuel to meet the increased energy requirements. This fuel comes from glucose, a type of sugar that the body derives from the food we eat. During a heavy workout, the muscles use up the glucose in the bloodstream much faster than under normal conditions. Therefore, the level of sugar in the blood (blood glucose level) drops, which triggers a series of reactions in the body to restore the blood sugar levels to normal. The pancreas, an organ that plays a key role in managing blood sugar levels, comes into action at this point. It contains groups of cells called islets of Langerhans which contains several types of cells including alpha and beta cells. When blood glucose levels drop, the alpha cells in the pancreas release a hormone called glucagon. Glucagon has many roles in the body, but in this context, one of its main roles is to signal the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. The liver typically stores some glucose as glycogen, a compound that is broken down into glucose when needed. When the glucagon reaches the liver, it triggers the conversion of glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This process, called glycogenolysis, replenishes the glucose in the bloodstream, thus ensuring that the body has enough energy to continue with the exercises. This is not the only process activated by glucagon to raise blood glucose; gluconeogenesis, the manufacturing of glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates, is another pathway activated to increase the blood glucose level. If a person works out heavily, therefore, it would cause the body to use up glucose at a faster rate, reducing the amount of glucose in the blood. This state would signal the pancreas to release more glucagon to cause the liver to release more glucose into the bloodstream, restoring balance. Therefore, the answer to your question would be A: more glucagon is released. It's worth mentioning that the body's management of blood sugar levels is a dynamic and complex process that depends on a host of factors. The body engages several hormones and processes to keep the glucose levels in check, with the release of glucagon and its effect on the liver being just one of them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive. Guess a valid title for it!

Title: Once Were Warriors Movie plot: Beth left her small town and, despite her parents' disapproval, married Jake \\"the Muss\\" Heke. After 18 years they live in an unkempt state house in an unnamed New Zealand city and have five children. Their interpretations of life and being MÄori are tested. Their eldest daughter, Grace, keeps a journal in which she chronicles events as well as stories she tells her younger siblings. Jake is fired from his job and is satisfied with receiving unemployment benefit, spending most days getting drunk at the local pub with his friends, singing songs, and savagely beating any patron he considers to have stepped out of line. He often invites crowds of friends from the bar to his home for drunken parties. When his wife \\"gets lippy\\" at one of his parties, he brutally attacks her in front of their friends. Beth turns to drink when things go wrong, and has angry outbursts and occasional violence of her own, on a much smaller scale. Her children fend for themselves, resignedly cleaning the blood-streaked house after their father has beat their mother. Nig, the Hekes' eldest son, moves out to join a gang whose rituals include getting facial tattoos (in MÄori culture called tÄ moko). He is subjected to an initiation beating by the gang members but is then embraced as a new brother, and he later sports the gangâs tattoos. Nig cares about his siblings but despises his father. He is angered when his mother is beaten but deals with it by walking away. The second son, Mark \\"Boogie\\" Heke, has a history of minor criminal offences; he is taken from his family and placed in a foster home as a ward of the state due to his parents' home life. Despite his initial anger, Boogie finds a new niche for himself, as the foster homeâs manager Mr. Bennett helps him embrace his MÄori heritage. Jake does not care that Boogie was taken away; he comments that it will do him some good, toughen him up a bit. Beth is heartbroken and scrapes money together to visit him.

The family likely tidied the","completion":"room in a hurry, focusing primarily on the floor's appearance in an effort to give the illusion of a clean and well-maintained space. It's a common tactic employed by households everywhere - covering the larger surfaces to impress visitors while neglecting smaller, less noticeable areas such as countertops, backsplashes, and cupboard interiors. Upon closer inspection of the counter, one might notice a multitude of stains, crumbs, and dried food particles. Evidence of various meal preparations, perhaps hurried or careless, leaves an unpleasant visual and adds to the growing concern that this area has not been adequately maintained. Pots, pans, and utensils, still caked in remnants of prior meals, lay unceremoniously in the sink and on surrounding countertops, awaiting their inevitable trips to the dishwasher. The clutter on the counter itself is haphazard and disorganized, making it difficult to discern where the most-used items, like the toaster, blender, or cutting board, are amid the chaos. A used cutting board sits precariously on the edge of the counter, not far from the sink, flecked with diced vegetables and other food remnants indicating recent use. Discarded food preparation byproducts, such as empty cans, plastic containers, and food wrappers, are strewn about, compounding the overall untidiness. Amidst this disarray, a more powerful concern arises - the potential for cross-contamination. With raw foods and their corresponding utensils left unclean and scattered about, the risk of spreading harmful bacteria and pathogens is increased significantly. Proper food safety practices, such as cleaning cutting boards and knives after each use and separating raw meats from produce, are essential to maintaining a healthy kitchen environment. Furthermore, it's important to consider the impact that a dirty kitchen countertop can have on the mental wellbeing of the family members who use it daily. A cluttered and unclean space can lead to feelings of agitation, stress, and lack of motivation to cook or prepare healthy meals. It may even devolve into arguments if one family member takes umbrage at the lack of cleanliness and resents being burdened with the responsibility of constantly restoring order. To remedy this problematic situation, the family must not rely solely on surface-level cleaning methods, focusing primarily on areas that are easily noticeable. They must shift their attention to the spaces that are not immediately seen but are equally important to maintain a truly clean and healthy living environment. Creating a regular cleaning routine, complete with detailed instructions for cleaning each area of the kitchen and the proper disposal of food waste, can help ensure everyone is on board with maintaining a safe and pleasant space. Additionally, employing organizational systems such as sleek storage solutions or designated spaces for frequently used items can help the household create better order within the space. By taking the time to thoroughly clean the countertops and other kitchen surfaces on a routine basis, the family can create a much more conducive environment for healthy cooking endeavors and the overall health, safety, and happiness of everyone involved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: John Boehner, at a presser just now, just said something that pushed immigration reform closer to death than anything he has said thus far: House Speaker John Boehner says he will not allow any House-passed immigration legislation to be blended with the Senate’s sweeping reform bill, further quashing the chances of comprehensive immigration reform legislation being signed into law anytime soon. “We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,” Boehner told reporters Wednesday. At the presser, Boehner also refused to say whether any of the piecemeal proposals reportedly being developed by House Republicans will get a vote this year, which means they almost certainly won’t. He did say that GOP Rep Bob Goodlatte, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, “is working with our members and across the aisle on developing a set of principles for us to deal with this issue.” But if Boehner really means that Republicans will not “ever” go to conference on the Senate bill, it’s very hard to see a path to comprehensive reform. Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, emails me this: “If Boehner kills off immigration reform, he’s going to go down as the Speaker who helped kill off the GOP. If he doesn’t promise to go to conference, he won’t be able to get Democrats to vote for any immigration measures, and he won’t be able to pass them with just Republican votes. He’s painting himself into a corner with procedural concessions to the far right, where failure is the only possible outcome. If he keeps to this, he’s dooming reform. Let’s hope he wants a legacy that includes growing the economy and saving his party.” The point here is this. The House GOP leadership will never hold a vote on any comprehensive reform package that includes legalization or citizenship. So the only way forward is if House Republicans pass piecemeal provisions — border security measures, plus some sort of legalization proposal for the 11 million, or barring that, the Kids Act (which gives citizenship only to the DREAMers). That would be a route to comprehensive reform if it provided a way to get to conference. Boehner doesn’t want anything the House passes to be seen as a vehicle for going to conference, because conservatives will revolt. But here is the rub: House Republicans, on their own, probably can’t pass anything that addresses the 11 million — and may not even be able to pass the KIDS Act — if it is seen as a vehicle for going to conference, since conservatives would resist at all costs. So Democrats would be needed to pass any such proposals. But Democrats will only vote for such proposals with an assurance that we would then go to conference. And so, by ruling out conference, Boehner may have just closed off the last remaining route to getting reform done. There has been a lot of talk lately about how the GOP establishment is going to wage war on the hard-liners inside the GOP that are forcing unelectable candidates and deeply unpopular positions on the party. Immigration reform, however, is a clear cut case where this vow isn’t mattering in the slightest. Many of the same constituencies within the GOP who are warning against letting the hard liners’ demand for a Total War against Obamacare drag the party into situations like the recent shutdown debacle — the business community, the professional consultant establishment, etc. — are the same ones who are urging the party to adopt immigration reform, for the long term good of the GOP. But it isn’t happening. We are not getting immigration reform if House GOP leaders are not willing to get the anti-amnesty-at-all-costs crowd a bit riled up at some point in the process. Boehner’s quotes today suggest they just aren’t willing to do that, whatever the long term costs to the party. ||||| As Republican leaders in the House of Representatives appear resigned to let a bipartisan immigration bill slide off of their to-do list in 2013, a new poll suggests leaders might want to rethink that plan. Republican pollster Jon Lerner and his team at Basswood Research released a poll Tuesday showing that in 20 Republican-controlled swing districts, voters overwhelmingly want their members of Congress to hammer out a deal on immigration reform and to do it fast. [READ: Immigration Reform Boosts Economic Recovery] The poll shows that more than 70 percent of voters supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, 80 percent approved of implementing a better electronic worker verification system and 78 percent supported passing a DREAM Act, legislation that would allow young adults who were brought to the country as children a chance at citizenship. In California, the poll shows that Republican Rep. Jeff Denham and Rep. David Valadao are among the most vulnerable lawmakers. The longer the House waits to vote on an immigration package, the tougher their re-election could become. Sensing their vulnerability, both Denham and Valadao signed onto the Democratic-drafted immigration bill in October that would put many immigrants who are in the country illegally on a path to citizenship. Even tea party food stamp crusader Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., who is also cited as endangered in the poll, has softened his stance on immigration reform after encountering a young immigrant at a town hall. [READ: Business, Faith and Silicon Valley Leaders to Pepper House on Immigration] It's not just immigration, however, that has voters reconsidering their elected officials. The poll found that the Republican brand as a whole is increasingly damaged in swing districts. The poll showed that voters in the 20 swing districts were frustrated with President Barack Obama. Only 41 percent of voters approved of his job performance and 34 percent approved of congressional Democrats. But voters in the GOP swing districts are irrefutably tired of Republicans back in Washington. Only 27 percent approve of them. The poll of 1,000 adults was taken between Nov. 2, 2013 and Nov. 3, 2013 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. More News: ||||| House Speaker John Boehner says he will not allow any House-passed immigration legislation to be blended with the Senate’s sweeping reform bill, further quashing the chances of comprehensive immigration reform legislation being signed into law anytime soon. “We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,” Boehner told reporters Wednesday. Immigration reform advocates had hoped that a “conference”- or legislative negotiation – between House and Senate lawmakers could incorporate ideas from both chambers into compromise legislation that might be palatable to those who say a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants – or at least legalization – is essential to fixing the country’s broken immigration system. Republican House Speaker John Boehner talks about the status of immigration reform legislation in the House. But some conservatives had been pushing against House passage of any immigration legislation, arguing that Senate Democrats would use the conference to inject more liberal policies and then force Republicans in the House to stomach changes they say are unfair to those who came to the country legally. The GOP speaker has pledged for months not to bring the Senate “Gang of Eight” bill, passed with bipartisan support in the upper chamber this summer, up for a vote. That legislation would allow for a lengthy path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants – something that many Republicans decry as “amnesty\\" that could hurt job-seeking Americans. Republican lawmakers have instead been working on smaller pieces of legislation that would address border security, employment verification, and possibly a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Boehner refused to say Wednesday whether he plans to bring any of those measures to a vote before the end of the year. Boehner pointed to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., as the chamber’s point person on the legislative efforts, saying Goodlatte “is working with our members and across the aisle on developing a set of principles for us to deal with this issue.” He also dismissed the notion that Republicans are delaying reform legislation to focus on problems with the new health care law. Charles Dharapak / AP House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, accompanied by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., which has responsibility over matters relating to healthcare, speaks about President Obama's health care law after Republican lawmakers met at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2013. \\"We need to go about this in a way that the American people and our members can absorb,” he said. The apparent dead end for comprehensive reform has not deterred immigration proponents, who have kept pressure on House leaders despite the dim outlook for legislation this year. Hours before addressing reporters, Boehner was confronted by immigrant children while he was eating breakfast at a Capitol Hill diner. In a video released by the organization Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), Boehner told the protesters he is “trying to find some way to get this thing done.” The White House has kept public pressure up as well. President Barack Obama is meeting with faith leaders Wednesday to discuss the need for reform, and Vice President Joe Biden will give an address on the issue Thursday in Atlanta, Ga. Frank Thorp contributed to this story. This story was originally published on ||||| Summary:","completion":"House Speaker John Boehner announced that he would not allow any House-passed immigration legislation to be combined with the Senate's sweeping reform bill, which diminishes the chances of comprehensive immigration reform legislation being signed into law in the near future. This statement pushes immigration reform closer to its demise and makes it difficult to envision a path to comprehensive reform. Boehner did not mention whether the piecemeal proposals developed by House Republicans would get a vote this year. The situation suggests that House GOP leaders are unwilling to confront the anti-amnesty group and risk the long-term consequences for the party. However, a poll released by Republican pollster Jon Lerner of Basswood Research revealed that in 20 Republican-controlled swing districts, more than 70% of voters supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, suggesting that House leaders might reconsider their approach."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the march that Con Whalen said was \\"a waste of time\\" though he enjoyed every step?, using the article: Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The full name of the march that Con Whalen said was \\"a waste of time\\" though he enjoyed every step is the Jarrow March, also known as the Jarrow Crusade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Whose poem about Achilles did Homer persuade Jason that he should read?","completion":"The given sentence, \\"Whose poem about Achilles did Homer persuade Jason that he should read?\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable, but it could be considered a little complex due to its structure. Let's break down the components of the sentence to gain a clearer understanding of its meaning. 1. Syntax: The sentence is syntactically acceptable as it follows the necessary grammatical structure of a question in English. It begins with the interrogative word \\"whose,\\" which is used to ask about ownership or authorship. The basic structure of the sentence is subject-verb-object (SVO), where \\"Homer\\" is the subject, \\"persuade\\" is the verb, and \\"Jason\\" is the indirect object. The question then continues by specifying what Jason should read: \\"a poem about Achilles.\\" The sentence ends by forming a relative clause that further explains the action or the persuasion made by Homer. 2. Semantics: Semantics refers to the meaning derived from the sentence. The sentence is semantically acceptable as it poses a valid question asking about a poem related to Achilles and who authored it. It also conveys the idea that Homer persuaded Jason to read this particular poem. However, it may require a bit of mental parsing to understand the exact meaning due to its complex structure. To simplify the sentence and make it easier to understand, one could rephrase it as: \\"Which poet's work about Achilles did Homer convince Jason to read?\\" This rephrasing maintains the same meaning as the original sentence but presents it in a more straightforward manner. In conclusion, the sentence, \\"Whose poem about Achilles did Homer persuade Jason that he should read?\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. However, it is somewhat complex and could be rephrased to convey its meaning more clearly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, answer the following question.

Three of the people sickened, all hospital patients in Kansas, later died. The disease, caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Blue Bell suspended production at its plants in Brenham, Texas; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Sylacauga, Alabama last spring and said it conducted a major overhaul of production at all three plants.

Pataki said he expected the facility to generate thousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and suppliers catering to the factory. He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings. But industry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff in one or a few segments of the semiconductor market.

Isaac Asimov (; c. January 2, 1920 - April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification. Asimov attended New York City public schools from age 5, including Boys High School in Brooklyn. Graduating at 15, he went on to Seth Low Junior College, a branch of Columbia University in Downtown Brooklyn designed to absorb some of the Jewish and Italian-American students who applied to Columbia College, then the institution's primary undergraduate school for men with quotas on the number of admissions from those ethnic groups. Originally a zoology major, Asimov switched to chemistry after his first semester as he disapproved of \\"dissecting an alley cat\\". After Seth Low Junior College closed in 1938, Asimov finished his BS degree at University Extension (later the Columbia University School of General Studies) in 1939. After two rounds of rejections by medical schools, Asimov in 1939 applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia; initially rejected and then accepted only on a probationary basis, he completed his Master of Arts degree in chemistry in 1941 and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biochemistry in 1948. In between earning these two degrees, he spent three years during World War II working as a civilian at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station, living in the Walnut Hill section of West Philadelphia from 1942 to 1945. In September 1945, he was drafted into the U.S. Army; if he had not had his birth date corrected, he would have been officially 26 years old and ineligible. In 1946, a bureaucratic error caused his military allotment to be stopped, and he was removed from a task force days before it sailed to participate in Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll. He served for almost nine months before receiving an honorable discharge on July 26, 1946. He had been promoted to corporal on July 11. After completing his doctorate and a postdoc year, Asimov joined the faculty of the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949 with a 5,000 (equivalent to 51,427 in 2017) salary, with which he remained associated thereafter. By 1952, however, he was making more money as a writer than from the university. The difference grew, and in 1958 Asimov stopped teaching to become a full-time writer. Being tenured, he retained the title of associate professor (which he had held since 1955), and in 1979, the university honored his writing by promoting him to full professor of biochemistry. Asimov's personal papers from 1965 onward are archived at the university's Mugar Memorial Library, to which he donated them at the request of curator Howard Gotlieb. In 1959, after a recommendation from Arthur Obermayer, Asimov's friend and a scientist on the U.S. missile protection project, Asimov was approached by DARPA to join Obermayer's team. Asimov declined on the grounds that his ability to write freely would be impaired should he receive classified information. However, he did submit a paper to DARPA titled \\"On Creativity\\" containing ideas on how government-based science projects could encourage team members to think more creatively. Did he further his education?","completion":"Yes, Isaac Asimov indeed furthered his education throughout his early life and career. After concluding his time in the New York City public schools system, including his completion of studies at Boys High School in Brooklyn at the young age of 15, he went on to Seth Low Junior College, a branch of Columbia University in Downtown Brooklyn. Initially, he was a zoology major but opted to switch to chemistry after the first semester. Unfortunately, Seth Low Junior College closed in 1938, and Asimov completed his Bachelor of Science (BS) degree at University Extension, which would later become known as the Columbia University School of General Studies, in 1939. His pursuit of higher education didn't stop there. After two rounds of rejections by medical schools, Asimov applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia. Initially rejected and then accepted on probationary terms, he proved his mettle by completing his Master of Arts degree in chemistry in 1941. During World War II, from 1942 to 1945, Asimov spent three years working at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station as a civilian. After his stint at the navy yard and a brief nine-month service in the U.S Army, Asimov returned to academia to complete his Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.) in biochemistry in 1948. Upon completing his doctorate, Asimov undertook a postdoctoral year and subsequently joined the faculty of the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949. Despite eventually shifting his focus to full-time writing in 1958, due to greater financial returns and perhaps, passion, Asimov remained associated with the university. His teaching contributions and prolific writing were recognized by the university when they promoted him to full professor of biochemistry in 1979. In sum, Asimov continuously sought to further his education, from his early years in the New York City public schools system, to his comprehensive studies at Columbia University, concluding with a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biochemistry.

Summarize this article: CLOSE Deep in the jungles of Borneo, scientists have discovered the world’s oldest paintings in ancient caves. Buzz60 The world's oldest figurative artwork, which was discovered in Borneo, is at least 40,000 years old. (Photo: Luc-Henri Fage) The world’s earliest-known cave painting of an animal has been discovered on Borneo in Indonesia. It dates back to at least 40,000 years ago, a new study says. The drawing is even older than the famous images of animals found in France and Spain. It was spotted in a remote cave by a team of archaeologists from Australia and Indonesia. “The oldest cave art image we dated is a large painting of an unidentified animal, probably a species of wild cattle still found in the jungles of Borneo,\\" said study lead author Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist and geochemist at Griffith University in Australia, in a statement. \\"It is now the earliest known figurative artwork.” The paintings are more than 4,000 years older than the previous record holders on nearby Sulawesi, according to Science magazine. The meaning of the animal is unknown, Aubert said. “We think it wasn’t just food for them – it meant something special.\\" In addition to the animal drawing, which is about 5 feet wide, scientists also found red- and purple-colored hand stencils and cave paintings of human scenes. These remote caves on Borneo have been known to contain prehistoric drawings since the 1990s. Paintings of human figures were discovered in a cave in East Kalimantan on Borneo, Indonesia. The figures were drawn anywhere from 13,600 to 20,000 years ago. (Photo: Pindi Setiawan) This finding adds to the mounting view that cave art – one of the most important innovations in human cultural history – did not arise in Europe as long believed, and that artists in Southeast Asia played a key role in its development. Humans began to create art in caves at a similar time in remote corners of the Ice Age world, the researchers said. \\"Whether this is a coincidence, the result of cultural convergence in widely separated regions, large-scale migrations of a distinct Eurasian population, or another cause remains unknown,\\" the study said. Rock art expert Adhi Agus Oktaviana, another author of the study, said that “the new findings illustrate that the story of how cave art emerged is complex.\\" However, “who the ice age artists of Borneo were and what happened to them is a mystery,” noted study co-author Pindi Setiawan, an Indonesian archaeologist. The study was published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature. Mulberry-colored hand stencils are superimposed over older, reddish/orange hand stencils in this Indonesian cave art.

It depicts ... a cow. Despite the humble subject matter, the painting is extraordinary because it's at least 40,000 years old. That makes it thousands of years older than the oldest such paintings in Europe. The Indonesia painting is one of thousands of drawings and stencils in a warren of limestone caves tucked into remote mountains at the far eastern edge of the island of Borneo, a part of Indonesia called Kalimantan. Archaeologists went there in the 1990s looking for cave art. Archaeologist Maxime Aubert of Griffith University in Australia says that when they showed photos of cave art to the local people, \\"They said, 'Oh, yeah, we've seen something like that in the caves.' \\" The locals knew the caves from going there to harvest birds' nests for the Asian market in birds' nest soup. The drawings and paintings included lots of hand stencils made by putting a hand up against a rock and blowing liquid ochre onto it — as well as paintings of animals and of stick-figure humans with headdresses and spears. But no one knew how old they were. Enlarge this image toggle caption Kinez Riza/Nature Kinez Riza/Nature Recently, Aubert used a sophisticated form of dating technology that measures the elements uranium and thorium in the rock underlying the paintings, described in this week's issue of the journal Nature. The result, he says, \\"was amazing.\\" The oldest were anywhere from 40,000 to 52,000 years old. And some were clearly representational art and \\"not just ... an abstract design,\\" Aubert says. \\"It's clearly like someone decided to depict what they saw, like an animal or like another human,\\" he says. \\"And they made that, they did that on purpose.\\" The oldest figurative painting was of a wild cow with horns that dates to at least 40,000 years ago — thousands of years older than similar figurative paintings in Europe. Older \\"artwork\\" has been found in Europe and Africa, but they are geometric drawings, consisting of lines and dots and hash marks. And there are carved figurines from Europe and Israel that date back even further. Enlarge this image toggle caption Pindi Setiawan/Nature Pindi Setiawan/Nature Cave art expert Genevieve von Petzinger of the University of Victoria in Canada says the discovery is exciting but not that surprising. \\"I feel like we've been waiting for this now,\\" von Petzinger says, adding that she thinks figurative art goes back a lot further than people thought. \\"My personal opinion is that our ancestors in Africa already knew how to do all this stuff.\\" Von Petzinger says she expects archaeologists will likely find it, if they look in the right places. Aubert says the earliest hand stencils in the Borneo caves date back more than 50,000 years. He says that the painters kept returning to the caves and adding new work until about 20,000 years ago — an astonishing 30,000-year span — and that their work got more complicated over time. Enlarge this image toggle caption Pindi Setiawan/Nature Pindi Setiawan/Nature Cave art paints a picture, literally, of our ancestors' world that old bones or tools cannot, Aubert says. \\"You can see the things ... they were doing — ritual dances, they were wearing those headdresses, you can see all that,\\" he says. \\"The rock art kind of talks to you, it kind of feels like, 'yeah, they kind of did that for me, you know.' \\" And they did it for their families, apparently. In one cave, the scientists crawled through a narrow opening into a side chamber. Inside, there were more hand stencils ... but different. \\"You go in and you look and there are hand stencils there, but they're really small,\\" Aubert says. \\"It's children.\\" Prehistoric kindergarten finger painting, perhaps. ||||| This animal image may be the world’s oldest figurative art Daubed in orange ochre at least 40,000 years ago, images of what appear to be wild cattle on the Indonesian island of Borneo are now the oldest known figurative paintings in the world. Painted in a remote limestone cavern, they are more than 4000 years older than the previous record holders on nearby Sulawesi, and they add to evidence that thriving artistic traditions were emerging simultaneously in Europe and Asia. Until recently, most researchers thought the home of the earliest figurative paintings—those depicting people and animals rather than abstract objects—was France’s Chauvet Cave. Vivid images of prehistoric rhinos, cave lions, and horses there have been dated to about 35,000 years old. But in 2014, a team led by geochemist and archaeologist Maxime Aubert of Griffith University in Gold Coast, Australia, dated paintings of wild pigs in caves on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi to at least 35,400 years old. Stencils of human hands there were at least 40,000 years old. Now, as they report today in Nature , Aubert’s joint Indonesian-Australia team has dated a painting of what may be a banteng, a Southeast Asian wild cattle, in Borneo’s Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave, to at least 40,000 years ago; hand stencils there may be up to 52,000 years old, making them among the oldest such prints in the world. “This is a remarkably important finding,” says Sue O’Connor, an archaeologist at Australian National University in Canberra who focuses on Southeast Asia and Australia, but was not involved in the new study. “It shows that the [previously discovered] Sulawesi rock art … was not regionally unique, but rather is part of a larger artistic and symbolic tradition” tracking some of the earliest modern humans in Southeast Asia, she says. Rock art adorns many caves in the mountainous province of East Kalimantan. The researchers found that the paintings in Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave are of three styles and ages: the ancient orange animals and hand stencils; purplish hand stencils, intricate motifs, and dynamic human figures dated to 20,000 to 21,000 years ago; and black charcoal designs thought to have been left by Neolithic farmers about 4000 years ago. Over the millennia “there was clearly a shift from depicting the animal world to depicting the human world,” Aubert says—a trend also seen in the cave art of Europe. To date the paintings, Aubert’s team turned to a now widely used technique, measuring the ratios of uranium and thorium in the calcite crusts that had accumulated on top of the cave paintings. The scientists took 65 different samples and tested for contamination that could have come from sources other than the calcite. They showed that the calcite layers were youngest at the surface and oldest closer to the paintings, meaning the dating is sound, Aubert says. Jane Balme, an archaeologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth, says the discovery “draws attention to the widespread similarities in human’s symbolic expression across the globe.” We now know that the famous cave art of Europe “is just one area where such expression occurred 40,000 years ago,” she says. But precisely how the various styles of art are linked to waves of migration is still an open question. “The discovery of three different chronological styles is quite amazing, as we can follow the evolution and changes of rock art over 50,000 years,” says Francois-Xavier Ricaut, a biological anthropologist from the University of Toulouse in France, who has also been working on Borneo. He says the big question now is whether the two older types of art represent the arrival of different peoples or were created by one population whose style evolved over time. Aubert suspects humans in the region—present as far back as 60,000 to 70,000 years ago—didn’t create art until populations reached a critical mass. That wouldn’t have been true of the region’s earliest inhabitants, of whom no art has been discovered. His team plans to look for butchered animal bones, tools, and other traces of the ancient artisans in the caves, starting next year. “We want to find out who made those paintings,” he says. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A cave painting of a wild cow in Borneo, Indonesia, has been discovered by archaeologists and dated to at least 40,000 years ago, making it the world's earliest known figurative artwork.

What happens to the wavelength and speed of water waves as they move from deep to shallow region? Does the speed of the pulse wave change as it moves up a rope? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"Okay little buddy, imagine you have a big puddle of water that goes from deep to shallow. As water waves move from the deep part to the shallow part, they slow down. This is because there's less room for the water to move in the shallow part. As the waves slow down, they also get closer together, which means their wavelength gets shorter. Now, think about a rope – say, like the one used for a game of tug-of-war. When you send a wave, or pulse, up the rope, the speed of that pulse can change. If the rope gets thicker or the tension increases as the pulse moves up, the speed of the pulse can slow down. So, for the multi-choice problem, I would say the answer is: (1). No - The questions are not the same because they refer to two different situations: water waves and a pulse wave in a rope.

Movie plot title: Star Trek Nemesis Movie plot: On Romulus members of the Romulan Imperial Senate debate whether or not to accept the terms of peace and alliance with the Reman rebel leader Shinzon. The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire, used as miners and cannon fodder. A faction of the military is in support of Shinzon, but the Praetor and senate are set against it. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and remaining senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room by a military-aligned senator. Meanwhile, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E prepares to bid farewell to first officer Commander William Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi, who are being married on Betazed. En route, they discover a positronic energy reading on a planet in the Kolaran system near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Lieutenant Commander Data land on Kolarus III and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data. When the android is reassembled it introduces itself as B-4. The crew deduce it to be a less-advanced, earlier version of Data. Picard is contacted by Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway and orders the ship on a diplomatic mission to nearby Romulus. Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a military coup by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the Federation and to bring freedom to Remus. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by Romulans to plant a high ranking spy into the Federation, but the project was abandoned and Shinzon left on Remus as a child to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the Scimitar. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the Enterprise crew discover the Scimitar is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms. There are also unexpected attempts to communicate with the Enterprise computers, and Shinzon himself violates Troi's mind through the telepathy of his Reman...

News article: Interim president wins Polish runoff election Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- Poland's Interim President Bronislaw Komorowski has won a runoff election against Jaroslaw Kaczynski, twin brother of former President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April. The Polish electoral commission said Monday that Komorowski garnered 53 percent of the vote versus Kaczynski's 47 percent. Sunday's ballot was required under Polish law after an earlier round of voting failed to give either candidate more than 50 percent of the vote. Both candidates addressed supporters in televised speeches from their campaign headquarters Sunday night, after exit polling showed Komorowski holding a slim lead. Kaczynski had congratulated his rival on exit poll results, but had not conceded victory. Komorowski said, \\"I congratulate Poland and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for turning out to vote in such large numbers.\\" The president in Poland is primarily a ceremonial figure, but he has the power to veto laws, and thus helps shape politics. Kaczynski, once prime minister, is a divisive figure in Polish politics. His far-right Law and Justice party ran on a nationalist platform with the slogan, \\"Poland comes first.\\" \\"Poland has to be a strong country, otherwise it will not exist,\\" he said recently. \\"I want to tell everyone here that as president I won't just be the head of state -- I will look after the strength of the Polish nation.\\" Komorowski is a moderate who ran for the center-right Civic Platform. \\"We have been on this road for 21 years together, and we have been right,\\" Komorowski said on the campaign trail. \\"We have been moving toward democracy and navigating our way in a free economy.\\" The former president, his wife and more than 90 others were killed April 10 in western Russia on their way to a service commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn.

Kevin and his wife, Sarah, had been coping with their individual illnesses for months, trying their best to support each other despite the intense suffering they both experienced. Even with the seemingly insurmountable challenges they faced, the couple's love endured – their bond, stronger than ever, became their bedrock. Sarah, unfortunately, lost her battle against cancer, leaving Kevin to confront his grief on top of his own debilitating condition. As her funeral approached, Kevin struggled to find the strength to attend, unsure if his fragile body could withstand the emotional turmoil. In the days leading up to the somber occasion, he spent hours reminiscing about their time together, remembering the happiest moments of their lives in an attempt to find solace amidst the pain. Eventually, the day of the funeral arrived. Despite his weakened state, Kevin was determined to be there for Sarah, to honor her memory, and to say his final goodbyes. He mustered every ounce of strength left in him and left his home, knowing that it could be the last time he stepped outside. As he stood next to her casket, his disease-ridden body trembled, and he felt the overwhelming weight of sadness that comes with mourning the loss of a loved one. His anguished cries echoed through the small, dimly lit chapel that they had once visited together. Days after the funeral, Kevin became increasingly reclusive as loneliness engulfed him. While he longed for human connection, his disease drew the attention of the scientific world. Researchers saw Kevin as an opportunity to learn about this strange affliction, so elusive in its origins. Conversations with doctors and experts became his primary source of interaction. Over the following months, Kevin participated in various experimental treatments and trials, driven by a sliver of hope that a cure for Edelstein Syndrome could be found. His dedication to this cause had become his lifeline, giving him a sense of purpose amid the sorrow. Against all expectations, Kevin showed a remarkable improvement during one particular experimental drug trial. His unbearable pain gradually subsided, and his cognitive functions began to stabilize. The researchers were astounded by his progress, and their eagerness to discover the secrets of this potential cure accelerated. As the months went by, Kevin's condition improved significantly. The medical community was abuzz with his remarkable recovery, terming it the \\"Kevin Effect.\\" More and more resources were invested into developing the drug, and as the data piled up, it became increasingly clear that they had found something revolutionary. The cure for Edelstein Syndrome had been discovered, thanks in great part to Kevin's perseverance. Though his wife was gone, Kevin realized he had been given a second chance at life. Endeavoring to honor Sarah's memory in the best way he knew how, he dedicated the rest of his days to advocate for rare disease research, fighting for others who battle the same seemingly insurmountable odds. He established the Sarah Memorial Foundation, raising funds and awareness for those who needed it most, and he became a beacon of hope for families combating Edelstein Syndrome and other rare illnesses. Kevin's journey from loss and loneliness to hope and purpose had been long and arduous, but his determination to fight against his disease not only saved his own life but also granted hope to countless others. In the end, his love for Sarah, the bond that sustained them through their struggles, inspired him to make a difference in the world – a testament to the transformative power of love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rebecca liked to plant potatoes, but Kayla did not as","completion":"Kayla did not as she held a completely different set of interests and preferences when it came to gardening as well as leisure activities. Kayla had always been more of an individual who appreciated low-maintenance plants, given her hectic lifestyle and her busy schedule that left her little time to devote to a labor-intensive gardening process such as planting potatoes. Potatoes required a well-prepared soil, constant attention, and a significant amount of patience before a successful harvest, something that Kayla simply was not drawn to. Kayla, on the other hand, preferred the aesthetics and convenience of plants like succulents and various flowering plants, which could thrive with relatively minimal effort on her part. She loved the idea of curating a visually striking garden that would serve as an extension of her creative pursuits, incorporating her favorite color palettes and unique plant textures. Additionally, Kayla wasn't particularly keen on the taste of potatoes in general. Though she understood their importance as a staple food and their versatility in various culinary dishes, she still couldn't shake her desire for a more varied and exotic flavor palate. As such, she took it upon herself to grow a variety of herbs and spices that would elevate her own cooking pursuits, such as basil, mint, rosemary, and cilantro. Kayla also found that, from an environmental perspective, cultivating a diverse set of plants could contribute to a healthier and more balanced ecosystem by attracting a variety of pollinators and beneficial insects to her garden. She took great pride in curating a garden that was not only visually appealing but also played a small part in promoting sustainability and environmental conservation. Moreover, potatoes are tuberous plants that are prone to certain pests and diseases, which could sometimes be challenging to control, especially for busy individuals like Kayla, who wanted a worry-free gardening experience. She was especially concerned about the possibility of blight and other fungi-based diseases that could potentially affect not only her potato plants but also other crops in her garden. In conclusion, Rebecca liked to plant potatoes, but Kayla did not as her interests and preferences leaned towards low-maintenance plants, diversity in her garden, and having a passion for herbs and spices instead. Kayla's reluctance to plant potatoes stemmed from the need for an easier gardening process, her interest in creating a visually attractive and ecologically friendly garden, and her desire to avoid potential diseases and pests that might affect her other beloved plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Natalie could not remember.","completion":"(a). Rebecca could not remember. Rebecca asked Natalie what time their beginner's yoga class started because she could not remember. It has been a stressful week for her, filled with countless meetings and demanding deadlines. Lately, she had started to feel overwhelmed, making her forget details more frequently than usual. Natalie, who seemed to always have her life together, tried to hide her amusement behind a compassionate smile. She had grown to appreciate Rebecca's meekness and admired her humility. Despite her moments of forgetfulness, Rebecca always focused on the tasks at hand, never allowing the busyness of life to disconnect her from those around her. \\"6:30 pm, Becky,\\" Natalie said reassuringly, \\"We still have plenty of time. Are you ready? I packed an extra bottle of water for you, in case you forgot yours.\\" Rebecca brushed a strand of hair from her face and gratefully accepted the bottle, quietly noting how considerate her friend was. Besides being Rebecca's help in times of minor crises, Natalie was a supportive and unassuming presence in her life, and the fact that they were taking this yoga class together was no coincidence. They decided to take the class together to help them relax and unwind at the end of their intense work weeks. Both young professionals with illustrious careers, they recognized the importance of taking time out to care for their mental and physical well-being. Yoga seemed like the perfect activity to bring a sense of balance to their lives, reminding them how to stay calm and focused in a world that offered an abundance of distractions. As they ventured to the studio, they talked about their day-to-day experiences and their goals for embracing a more mindful, healthy lifestyle. They discussed the different styles of yoga they might want to try in the future, comparing the merits of Vinyasa, Iyengar, and Ashtanga, among others. While the beginner's class they were taking would provide a solid foundation, they were eager to explore the full spectrum of what yoga had to offer. Once at the studio, they were welcomed by the smell of calming essential oils and the soft, melodic sounds of nature-inspired music. The environment was serene, filled with calming colors and gentle lighting. Just being there melted away much of their stress before even beginning their practice. As they placed their mats on the studio floor and began the class, it was clear that their instructor, Ashley, was as experienced as she appeared. She guided the students through gentle stretching, both physical and mental, aimed at releasing any tension they carried within their bodies. Throughout the class, Rebecca felt her breathing slow down, her mind clear, and the cramped muscles that she hadn't realized were bothering her, begin to ease into relaxation. The poses Ashley taught were simple yet effective, encompassing the basic principles of yoga while providing a foundation for future growth. By the time they reached the famous Savasana, or final relaxation pose, Rebecca felt a sense of peace and fulfillment that she hadn't experienced in quite some time. As she would go on to find out later, so did Natalie. They shared a look of contentment as they lay on their mats, reflecting on the growth they felt within themselves. As the two friends left the yoga studio that evening, they knew that they had started something significant in their lives. Together, they were taking the first steps toward embracing equilibrium and building a deeper connection with the world around them. What started with a simple question about timing grew into a deep bond between two people who saw the value of supporting one another in their pursuit of personal growth and well-being. Through yoga and mindfulness, they would come to cherish both the strength they found within themselves and the bond that became stronger with each practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

Author Peter Benton (James Franciscus) and occasionally Irish-accented professional shark hater Ron Hamer (Vic Morrow) realize the truth but ambitious mayor William Wells (Joshua Sinclair) refuses to accept that a shark threatens their community. Fearing that a canceled wind-surfing regatta would derail his gubernatorial campaign, Wells has shark nets installed. But the sounds of teenagers splashing in the surf leads the shark to rip through the nets. The next day, the shark plows through the wind surfers, knocking them off their boards. But rather than eat the scattered teenagers, the shark targets the mayor's aide. Using its sea-exploding power, it flips the aide's boat then eats him.The mayor can no longer hide the truth. Benton and Hamer head out on the sea, planning to stuff dynamite down the shark's throat and cause it to explode. But the crafty, suspiciously wooden looking shark traps them in a cave; the men have to use their dynamite just to escape. Meanwhile, Benton's daughter Jenny (Stefania Girolami Goodwin) and some of her friends head out on a yacht, armed with some steak and a shotgun, intending to shoot the shark. Instead, its powerful bites on the bait knock Jenny into the water. Her friends pull her aboard but not until the shark bites off one of her legs. Mayor Wells's son was one of the friends she went out with, and Benton blames him for her injury. Determined to do something right, Wells goes out in a helicopter armed with a steak, apparently intending to hoist the shark into the air and suffocate it.

Her husband sends an independent cattle drover, called \\"Drover\\", to transport her to Faraway Downs. Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \\"King George\\". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle. The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land â in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from the film The Wizard of Oz. Nullah tells her that \\"King George\\" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a \\"magic man\\". Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aborigines, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory.

Are you trying to fix or modify something? Understanding the purpose will help narrow down the appropriate choice. Step 2: Evaluate the options Consider the two choices you have: (a) Can crush q-tip - Vise grips can indeed be used to crush a q-tip, but this option might not serve a practical purpose. (b) Can crush toaster - Using vise grips to crush a toaster could cause damage to the toaster and be a potential safety hazard. This option may not be desirable unless you are seeking to dispose of or recycle the toaster. Step 3: Determine if the options are safe and practical As you assess each option, check whether they are safe and practical for the task at hand. In general, crushing a q-tip with vise grips does not pose a significant safety risk, while attempting to crush a toaster could lead to accidents and electrical hazards. Step 4: Make the decision Since crushing a q-tip with vise grips is the safer and more practical option, go with choice (a). However, it's essential to remember that this choice is based on the limited information provided. There may be a more appropriate option if you understand the context and intention behind using vise grips for the task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Two countries used different methods to produce their energy. Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used Nuclear fission. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country caused more acid rain?","completion":"Based on the information provided, Albania, which used fossil fuels for energy production, likely caused more acid rain compared to Croatia, which used nuclear fission. Fossil fuel burning, which includes coal, oil, and natural gas, releases sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These acids then fall to the ground as acid rain, which can impact soil quality, damage buildings, and harm aquatic life. On the other hand, nuclear fission as a method of energy production does not emit the same levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides as fossil fuels. Nuclear power primarily generates steam and produces far fewer air pollutants that contribute to acid rain. However, nuclear energy has its own set of concerns, including the potential for catastrophic accidents, radioactive waste, and nuclear weapons proliferation risk. In this case, Albania that relied on fossil fuels for energy production would be responsible for more acid rain than Croatia, which used nuclear fission for its energy production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: You may wonder if there are other examples of static discharge. The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below. Question: \\"How is the top of a cloud different from the base of the cloud during a rainstorm?\\" Answer: \\"The positive charges are concentrated at the top\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choices: [i] no [ii] yes","completion":"During a rainstorm, the top of a cloud is different from the base of the cloud because it has more positive charges.

Be extra cautious around squeaky floorboards and doors. Leave the door unlocked and take an extra key. Have your fun and then sneak back in. If you arouse suspicion, give it up.\\"","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of the Bathroom Fake-Out: A Guide to Stealth and Deception Introduction Stealth and deception have been classic components of the art of war and espionage. But how do these skills apply to our everyday lives? Enter the 'bathroom fake-out'. The bathroom fake-out is a technique used by individuals who wish to covertly come and go from a room or location, usually to engage in activities they'd prefer to keep private. Often employed by teens, roommates, or individuals with insomniac tendencies, the bathroom fake-out requires precision, patience, and a careful understanding of your environment. In this article, we will explore the steps necessary to execute the perfect bathroom fake-out without arousing suspicion. Step 1: Reconnaissance As with any stealth operation, understanding your environment before making any moves is crucial. Make it a point to gain a mental map of the layout of the area, taking special note of the locations of any potential obstacles, squeaky floorboards, or doors. Preemptively establishing escape routes and ensuring they are clear of clutter or obstruction can mean the difference between success and failure. Step 2: Light and Quiet Steps The key to a smooth bathroom fake-out is to make the least amount of noise possible. Practice walking as lightly as you can, distributing your weight evenly across the balls of your feet to avoid exerting excessive pressure on any particular area. Be mindful of other noises; silence your phone, and if necessary, consider removing any noisy or jangly items (like keys) from your person. Step 3: Door Deception Before embarking on your operation, make sure the door of the room is unlocked. This will allow you to get out and complete your mission without the need to fumble with locks or risk being heard. As a backup measure, make sure to carry an extra key, just in case something goes awry. When it comes to opening and closing doors, use the \\"slow and steady\\" technique to minimize any creaking or squeaking that could alert others. Step 4: Enjoy Your Covert Endeavor With your stealth skills and deceptive tactics in place, take advantage of your newfound freedom to engage in whatever activity you desire. Whether it's a midnight snack, late-night gaming, or simply taking a moment to yourself, enjoy the fruits of your labor, knowing that nobody is the wiser. Step 5: Re-entry and Damage Control Similar to the process of sneaking out, your return should be executed with care and precision. Retrace your steps, maintaining your light and quiet movements to avoid drawing attention, and leave everything as it was before you left. If you've performed the entire operation correctly, it's unlikely you'll have aroused any suspicion. However, should you find yourself in a situation where you've been discovered or need an alibi, concocting an explanation (like a sudden need to use the bathroom) could save face. Conclusion The bathroom fake-out is an art form that relies on the skillful application of stealth and deception. By following the above steps and honing one's sense of situational awareness, anyone can execute the perfect bathroom fake-out with ease. So, the next time you're scheming a covert midnight activity, remember to step lightly, utilize your surroundings, and plan ahead to ensure a smooth and inconspicuous operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(I). World; (II). Sports; (III). Business; (IV). Science/Tech;","completion":"The given information does not provide enough context for me to accurately generate a summary of the content of the above article. However, I can attempt to discuss TDD mode, which stands for Time Division Duplexing mode, and offer a general understanding of its relation to data delivery in the context of communication technology. Additionally, I will assign the appropriate category (I to IV) at the end of this detailed answer. In the realm of telecommunication and wireless communication technology, Time Division Duplexing (TDD) is a method used to facilitate effective and efficient communication between devices. TDD mode involves dividing transmission time into alternating, non-overlapping time slots for data uplink and downlink. This system enables bidirectional communication, allowing data to be transmitted and received by a device simultaneously without the need for separate frequency bands. TDD mode is particularly beneficial in situations where the demand for data transmission is asymmetrical, which means that the amount of data transmitted in one direction is greater than in the other direction. Examples of such scenarios include Internet browsing, video streaming, and various online applications. Considering that the article refers to TDD mode as \\"not just data delivery,\\" it may discuss additional aspects or applications of this technology, such as its role in enhancing network efficiency, improving latency, or enabling more devices to connect simultaneously on the same frequency band. To elaborate, TDD mode has several advantages over its counterpart, Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) mode: 1. Flexible allocation of resources: TDD mode allows network operators to allocate more time slots for the direction requiring higher data throughput, thus improving overall network efficiency. 2. Less spectrum requirement: By using the same frequency band for both uplink and downlink, TDD mode requires fewer frequency resources than FDD mode. 3. Lower latency: Due to its nature of dividing transmission time into alternating time slots, TDD mode can enable lower latency communication compared to FDD mode, which may be critical for certain applications such as online gaming and virtual reality. 4. IoT compatibility: TDD mode's ability to handle a large number of low-power, low-data-rate devices makes it particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. From this discussion, it is clear that TDD mode plays an essential role in telecommunications and wireless communication technology. Thus, based on the categories provided, my best effort for assigning a category would be (IV). Science/Tech, as the topic primarily revolves around technology and its applications in telecommunication and wireless networking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? The maple changed into an oak from a cedar.","completion":"The sentence \\"The maple changed into an oak from a cedar\\" is linguistically acceptable in the sense that it follows basic English grammar rules, consisting of a subject (The maple), a verb (changed), and an object (an oak). It also includes a prepositional phrase (from a cedar) that adds additional information. However, the meaning of the sentence is somewhat ambiguous, and may be difficult for readers to understand. Linguistic acceptability can be evaluated based on several factors: 1. Syntax: The sentence uses a subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is standard for English syntax. The subject (The maple) is a noun phrase, the verb (changed) is in the simple past tense, and the object (an oak) is a noun phrase. The sentence also contains a prepositional phrase (from a cedar) that modifies the verb, providing additional context. From a syntactic standpoint, the sentence is acceptable. 2. Semantics: The sentence seems to communicate that a maple tree somehow transformed into an oak tree, which previously had been a cedar. However, this assertion is not logical, as trees do not spontaneously change species. This aspect of the sentence might cause confusion for readers, but it doesn't necessarily make the sentence linguistically unacceptable. Rather, it is the real-world relevance and scientific plausibility of the statement that is questionable. 3. Pragmatics: The sentence may be interpreted as a metaphor, in which the author is trying to convey a deeper meaning, perhaps related to change, growth, or transformation. In this context, the sentence may be seen as linguistically acceptable. However, without explicit knowledge of this intended metaphorical meaning, the sentence's ambiguity and lack of clarity make it less effective in conveying the intended message. 4. Style: The use of three different tree species in this sentence creates a sense of parallelism, which can enhance the style and flow of the writing. However, the overall meaning of the sentence may still be unclear or confusing to readers. In summary, the sentence \\"The maple changed into an oak from a cedar\\" is linguistically acceptable as it adheres to English grammar rules, but its meaning is ambiguous and may be difficult for readers to grasp. It may be interpreted as a metaphor for change and transformation, yet without prior knowledge of the intended meaning, the sentence may still be seen as unclear or confusing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She shrugs it off. Outside her office she has taped up a clear plastic suit, and a sign that reads, \\"All employees must don protective gear before coming in.\\" Such is life in limbo. Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy. The civil division is spread among a few boroughs. Their papers and documents, some 20,000 boxes worth, are stuck in a storage facility in Linden, N.J. \\"I am counting the days till we can have all the parts back in one place,\\" says Steven Banks, Legal Aid's associate attorney in chief. In the memories of the exiled workers, the old office has achieved mythical proportions. They say the wood paneling and rugs had the ability to cool emotions and lift spirits. The Legal Aid office on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, where 65 displaced workers have cobbled together space amid the faded and scratched walls, looks more like a bargain basement.

The reviewer mentioned owning the DVD and thought it was \\"badass\\" and a \\"pretty cool flick\\", which seems positive. 2. They find Melissa Bale, an actress in the movie, attractive, which is also a positive remark. 3. However, they state that the acting and plot are terrible, which is a strong negative sentiment. 4. They mentioned the clown being disgusting, but the movie is still \\"OK\\", which is not exactly negative but not quite positive. 5. They wouldn't recommend the movie for someone seeking entertainment after a hard day's work, which is a negative statement. 6. They suggest watching the movie only if there's nothing else to do and the person is obsessed with these types of films, which has a slightly negative connotation. 7. Lastly, they question the legitimacy of the DVD company owning the movie, making it sound like the movie isn't worth purchasing or being part of a decent company's library, another negative point. Although the reviewer has mixed opinions about the movie, the overall sentiment leans towards negative. They found some aspects enjoyable, but the disapproval of the acting, plot, and the fact that they wouldn't recommend it after a hard day's work suggests that the movie failed to impress them. So, a summary of the review's sentiment could be negatively mixed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Try to keep your work surface cold or roll the pastry out on marble. Set each assembled sausage rolls on a baking sheet and put the sheet in the refrigerator. Chill the rolls until the pastry hardens.","completion":"In this process, the task is to prepare, assemble and chill sausage rolls using puff pastry from an 18-ounce (500 g) package. First, the preparation of the work surface is essential. To begin with, you should sprinkle a small amount of flour on your counter or workspace. This step ensures that the puff pastry does not stick to the surface while you unroll and work with it. If possible, try to maintain a cold work surface, or consider rolling the pastry out on marble. A cooler surface helps maintain the integrity of the puff pastry layers and prevents it from becoming too soft or difficult to handle. Moving on to the puff pastry, you will need to unroll 2 sheets of thawed puff pastry from the package. The sheets must be thawed before working with them, as frozen sheets may break or become difficult to shape. As you unroll the pastry, be gentle and careful so as not to tear or damage the delicate layers. Next, you will assemble the sausage rolls using the puff pastry. Once the rolls have been assembled, arrange them on a baking sheet. This baking sheet will be used for chilling purposes in the next step. Depending on the size and number of sausage rolls you are making, you might have to use multiple baking sheets or combine them onto one large sheet. Now that the sausage rolls are assembled and placed on the baking sheet, transfer the sheet to the refrigerator. This chilling step is crucial for hardening the pastry. Chilling the rolls will solidify the butter in the pastry and help maintain its structure when baked, ensuring that the rolls will be light, flaky, and crispy. Make sure to leave the rolls in the refrigerator until the pastry has hardened before proceeding to the baking process. In summary, this task involves preparing the work surface, unrolling thawed puff pastry, assembling sausage rolls, placing them on a baking sheet, and chilling them in the refrigerator until the pastry hardens. Paying attention to the temperature of the work surface and puff pastry, as well as properly chilling the rolls, will result in delicious, flaky sausage rolls with a perfect puff pastry texture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A woman with a designer handbag is admiring the view.\\", does this mean that \\"After buying a new handbag, a woman notices how nice the view from her mansion is.\\"?","completion":"Not necessarily. While it's possible that the two sentences may be describing similar situations, there are a few key differences and assumptions made in the second sentence that are not explicitly mentioned in the first. Firstly, let's dissect the original statement: \\"A woman with a designer handbag is admiring the view.\\" In this sentence, we are only given a few specific details: 1. There is a woman. 2. She has a designer handbag. 3. She is admiring the view. Now, let's analyze the second statement: \\"After buying a new handbag, a woman notices how nice the view from her mansion is.\\" This sentence provides additional information that is not present in the original statement: 1. The woman bought a new handbag (implying that the designer handbag she possesses is newly purchased). 2. The woman has a mansion. 3. The view that she's admiring is specifically from her mansion. Comparing these two sentences, there are a few key aspects to consider in determining if they mean the same: 1. Designer handbag vs. new handbag: The first statement mentions that the handbag is designer, but it doesn't necessarily imply that it's new or recently purchased. The second statement emphasizes that it's a new handbag, but the designer aspect is not explicitly mentioned. 2. Mansion: The first statement does not mention where the woman is or any details about her residence. The woman could be admiring the view from anywhere—a park, a cafe, or even a friend's place. The second statement places her specifically at her mansion. 3. The view: While both statements agree that the woman is admiring a view, the first one does not specify from where. It could be any view that she finds beautiful. The second statement clarifies that she is admiring the view from her mansion. Given the additional information and assumptions in the second sentence, we cannot say that it's an exact interpretation or rephrase of the first statement. It presents a more detailed scenario but adds elements that were not explicitly mentioned in the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Evaluate each option based on common knowledge and logic. Step 3: Determine the most appropriate answer to the question based on the evaluation. Step 4: Explain why this answer is the best choice. --- Step 1: Analyze the given options. The options are: - die - meat - cuddly pet - feel hunger - learn how to dance Step 2: Evaluate each option based on common knowledge and logic. - die: If an animal doesn't eat, it will not receive the necessary nutrients and energy it needs to survive, which could ultimately lead to death. - meat: This option is not related to the consequence of an animal not eating. - cuddly pet: This option does not address the outcome of an animal not eating. An animal may be considered a cuddly pet regardless of if it is eating or not. - feel hunger: This option is valid as well. An animal that does not eat will likely feel hunger as a natural response of its body to the lack of food. - learn how to dance: This option is unrelated to the consequences of an animal not consuming food. Step 3: Determine the most appropriate answer to the question based on the evaluation. Based on the evaluation of the given options, \\"die\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question, as it directly addresses the consequences of an animal not eating and is the most serious outcome of the options presented. Step 4: Explain why this answer is the best choice. A human would choose \\"die\\" as the answer to the question because it highlights the dire consequences of an animal not eating. While \\"feel hunger\\" is also a valid response, it does not convey the severity of the situation and the long-term consequences of not consuming food. Therefore, \\"die\\" is the most appropriate answer to signify the importance of food for an animal's survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Surely there must be a better, more accessible and entertaining detailed account of the lives of Butch and Sundance than this!!! Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The review is negative. First and foremost, the title of the review itself provides a clue towards the overall sentiment expressed by the reviewer. 'How to ruin a good story!' indicates dissatisfaction and the perception that a potentially interesting story was poorly executed or managed. The body of the review comprises further substantiation for the negative sentiment. The reviewer recognizes the well-researched aspect of the content, which might generally be understood as a positive quality. However, the comment that follows immediately afterwards denounces the potential merit of the research by affirming that the reading experience was nonetheless 'boring.' This critique indicates that the reader was not engaged or entertained, which, in the realm of story-driven content, can be a significant drawback. The reviewer subsequently expounds on their dissatisfaction by describing the book as 'obsessed with minor, irrelevant details.' This critique suggests that the reviewer found the book to be overwhelming or convoluted with unnecessary information, which they believe detracts from the core essence of the story. In this context, the 'minor, irrelevant details' are presented as negatives because they render the 'readability an incredible chore.' Essentially, the reviewer is saying that the excessive minutiae make the book difficult, tiresome, or unpleasant to read. The review concludes with an expression of frustration and a rhetorical question that underscores the potential that, in the reviewer's opinion, was wasted in the book. The reviewer indicates disappointment and a feeling of missed opportunity by stating that there must be a 'better, more accessible, and entertaining detailed account of the lives of Butch and Sundance.' In conclusion, the reviewer offers no positive affirmation or commendation of the book in question, only criticism and dissatisfaction.

Write the equation angle pac on the bottom, a and b but that's all you need to know for a point. Separate the bottom lines of the triangle.; (c). Remember, all of the angles that comprise a straight line must be equal to 180 °. Because angle pab, angle bac, and angle caq combine together to make line pq, their angles must sum to 180 °.; (d). Draw diagonal lines across the angle 4v of the triangle directly at both shapes lines. When they intersect, make sure you do not intersect them.;","completion":"Let me explain it in a simple way: (c) is the correct answer. Think of it like this: We have a triangle with three angles - angle A, angle B, and angle C. We want to show that if we add those angles together, it will equal 180 degrees. Now, we do some drawing: 1. We have a triangle with A at the top, and B and C at the bottom corners. 2. We draw a straight line from the top (A) to somewhere outside the triangle, let's say point P. 3. We also draw another straight line from the top (A) to another point outside the triangle, let's say point Q. These two lines will meet at a straight line at the bottom, forming angle A with angle B and C. If we add angle PAB + angle BAC + angle CAQ, we get a straight line that is 180 degrees because they all connect together to form the straight line PQ. So, all three angles in a triangle - A, B, and C - add up to 180 degrees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

It can also suggest that PersonX may be boasting or speaking self-importantly. Step 3: Break down the Tail phrase. \\"brag about themselves and/or their accomplishments\\" means that PersonX is talking about their own achievements or qualities in a prideful manner. Step 4: Compare the Head and Tail phrases. Both the Head and Tail phrases depict PersonX talking in a self-important way, with the focus on their own achievements or qualities.

Answer:","completion":"The given review can both decrease and increase the chances of buying the product, depending on the aspects you prioritize, as the reviewer has provided both positive and negative feedback. Here is a detailed analysis: Decrease: 1. Delivery service - The reviewer had a negative experience with the delivery service as the product was received in poor condition. Multiple components had dents, flakes, or other damage. This could lead potential buyers to worry about the potential damage to the product they may receive during shipping and handling. 2. Quality control concerns - The fact that the product arrived damaged even though the box itself was not damaged may raise concerns about the quality control processes in place, as the reviewer suspected that someone had repackaged the box. This might decrease the confidence of potential buyers in the overall quality of the product. Increase: 1. Weber's outstanding customer service - The reviewer had a positive experience with Weber's customer service, which helped replace all the damaged parts swiftly. This highlights the company's commitment to customer satisfaction, which may give potential buyers confidence that if they encounter any issues with the product, they will be promptly addressed. 2. Excellent functionality and performance - The reviewer is pleased with the functionality and performance of the Weber Smokey Mountain smoker. This indicates that the product delivers on its promises and will likely provide a satisfying experience for potential buyers. The quality of the smoker itself may outweigh the negative aspects of the delivery experience.

Putin Announces Pullback from Ukraine Border MOSCOW — In an apparent attempt to halt the spiraling violence in southeastern Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin said on Wednesday that Russia was pulling troops back from the border, and he urged Ukrainian separatists to call off a referendum on sovereignty they hoped to hold on Sunday. Speaking at the Kremlin after talks with the president of Switzerland, who is acting as the chief mediator for Europe in the crisis, Mr. Putin said that Russia wanted to give diplomacy a chance. “We were told constantly about concerns over our troops near the Ukrainian border,” Mr. Putin said. “We have pulled them back. Today they are not at the Ukrainian border but in places of regular exercises, at training grounds.” NATO officials said that they saw no immediate sign that Russian forces had pulled back, news services reported from NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. Citing negotiations between Ukrainian separatists and the interim government in Kiev, Mr. Putin also said he was appealing “to representatives of southeast Ukraine and supporters of federalization to hold off the referendum scheduled for May 11, in order to give this dialogue the conditions it needs to have a chance.” The reaction in Kiev and among the separatists in southeastern Ukraine was a combination of suspicion and mistrust. In Ukraine there was a feeling that Mr. Putin was again seeking to manipulate the situation, while the separatists either declined to comment or said they were unsure exactly to whom the Russian leader was appealing. Mr. Putin said he wanted the authorities in Kiev to immediately halt all military actions in southeastern Ukraine, referring to them again as “punitive operations.” He also welcomed the release of militants the Ukrainians had been holding, particularly Pavel Gubarev, a “people’s governor” in Donetsk who had been detained by the Ukrainian security services. “We think the most important thing now is to launch direct dialogue, genuine, full-fledged dialogue between the Kiev authorities and representatives of southeast Ukraine,” he said, standing next to Didier Burkhalter, the president of Switzerland and current head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is coordinating the mediation effort. “This dialogue could give people from southeast Ukraine the chance to see that their lawful rights in Ukraine really will be guaranteed,” he said. Mr. Putin also left the door open to Russia accepting, under certain conditions, the May 25 presidential elections, which Moscow had previously rejected. Mr. Putin was basically demanding that the mediation achieve what Russia has been seeking since the rebellion in Kiev overthrew Ukraine’s leader and Moscow’s ally, President Viktor F. Yanukovych, on Feb. 28: that Kiev grant some level of autonomy to the regions, including electing their own governors and directing their own foreign policy with their immediate neighbors. Such a change would allow Russia some measure of control over the future direction of Ukraine and a possible veto over Ukraine’s attempts to join the European Union, or worse from Russia’s viewpoint, NATO. “We all want the crisis to end as soon as possible, and in such a way that takes into account the interests of all people in Ukraine no matter where they live,” said Mr. Putin, according to the official Kremlin transcript of his remarks. Given Russia’s record in Crimea, where Mr. Putin repeatedly denied that Russia’s soldiers were involved, only to admit later that they were, there was some chance that it was all a feint. Previously, for example, senior defense officials have said Russia was withdrawing what Western officials said were 40,000 troops from the border to barracks. But the soldiers remained. Both Crimea and southeastern Ukraine have large populations of ethnic Russians, and Mr. Putin has insisted on Moscow’s right to intervene to protect them if they are endangered. Western governments have accused the Kremlin of fomenting the very unrest and violence that Mr. Putin has vowed to protect ethnic Russians against. The pro-Russian militants who have seized public buildings in at least a dozen cities in eastern Ukraine have said they would hold a referendum on the future of the region on Sunday, creating a possible flash point with the interim government in Kiev. Analysts suggested that if the people in eastern Ukraine vote in the referendum Sunday to join Russia, or for independence, or they demand Russian protection in some orchestrated way, Mr. Putin will be forced to react. To avoid intervention after repeated statements that he would protect ethnic Russians everywhere would appear to be going back on his word and would make him look weak. “The decision was taken not to increase Russian involvement in Ukraine, and not to increase the chances of major violence there,” said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political analyst and a commentator for Kommersant FM radio. Most analysts believe that Mr. Putin wanted to avoid war, and a minor incursion into Ukraine would not have been enough to resolve the crisis there. Instead it could easily have developed into a long, bloody, expensive slog, bruising the reputation he gained in annexing Crimea with virtually no bloodshed. “This one would not have been bloodless,” said Mr. von Eggert. “This would have been a real war, not by stealth, not by new methods, but a real old-fashioned war and this is something that Mr. Putin does not want.” It would have also been followed by punitive Western sanctions that would have damaged Russia’s already weak economy, and cost Moscow potentially billions of dollars that it would prefer to spend at home. In the past couple of weeks, as death toll suddenly rose on both sides in Ukraine, there was concern in Moscow and elsewhere that events were beginning to take on a momentum which outsiders would be unable to control. Many pointed to Yugoslavia in 1991 where the violence on the ground eventually swamped the efforts to contain it. “The problem is that in all these types of conflicts, once the black swans have started to fly, you will never control the situation,” said Sergei Karaganov, dean of the School of International Economics and Foreign Affairs and periodic Kremlin adviser on foreign policy. “Law and order was beginning to fall apart, and more and more groups were fighting each other.” But pulling back from the threat, Mr. Putin seemed to be trying to reassert some measure of control. It is possible that the people holding the referendum could proceed without him, but the question of what happened next would then hang over the referendum. “It would be difficult to conduct this referendum without Russian support,” said Mr. von Eggert.

The key is to find one that matches your interests and natural abilities. If you like to walk, keep walking -- on snowshoes. If you want to try an endurance sport, go for cross-country skiing. Besides, snowboarding is just great fun. Not satisfied with these? Try downhill skiing, then. Downhill skiing is not as hard as it used to be -- shorter, lightweight, curved skis make any beginner feel like an Olympic winner. These newer skis -- along with another type of equipment called skiboards, which are even shorter than skis -- help you control your speed and body movements. Consider testing the latest high-tech skis or snowboards?Check with your local sports shops or the rental places at the ski mountains about sample programs. You could also try sledding. Use a wood-framed sled with steel runners or a plastic sled to head down a snowy hill. If you prefer ice to snow, think hockey or figure skating. Runners can also train during the winter in spite of wet or slippery roads. One of the easiest sports around, snowshoeing can be excellent cold-weather cross-training for runners and cyclists -- or anyone wanting to take a wintry walk in the woods. Snowshoes are smaller, lighter, and better than ever. If you want to try them out, you may be able to rent a pair for a day at many of the larger outdoor or sporting goods stores. Whatever sport you choose, don't rely on a friend for instruction. You wouldn't let an inexperienced doctor perform a brain operation on you, but why let one teach you to ski or skate? That's what instructors are for -- to help newcomers start out right. Instructors can give you advice about equipment, techniques, safety, and dealing with injuries if they do happen to you. Above all, if you want to progress, invest your time in learning the basic skills thoroughly. Everything else you do as a skier, boarder, or skater will be built on these first skills.

Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by China in the north and India in the south. Bhutan lacks a border with nearby Nepal due to the Indian state of Sikkim and with Bangladesh due to the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the region's second least populous nation after the Maldives. Thimphu is its capital and largest city, while Phuntsholing is its financial center. - Democracy (\\"\\" literally \\"rule of the commoners\\"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament.

Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \\"The School of the Elders\\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \\"The Great Vehicle\\"). Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 500 million followers or 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists. - The Mahabharata or Mahbhrata (US ; UK \\"\\") is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the \\"Ramayana\\". - South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. - Bengal (bgl; Bengali: , and ) is a region in Asia which is located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal.

In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hits on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a man (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan). During the drive, SuperCherry comes on to him and puts his hand over her breast, but then pulls it back. She then tries to give him a handjob over his pants, but he continues to resist her advances. The driver takes offense to Clint rejecting his girlfriend, but she says he probably just wants a closer contact. She again attempts and fails to seduce him and he asks the driver to let him get out.

Kennedy was born in Inverness, the son of Mary and Ian. He was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Lochaber High School in Fort William. He went on to study for a Master of Arts degree in Politics and Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At university he became politically active, joining the SDP, as well as the Dialectic Society. On 6 January 2006 Kennedy was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement that over the past eighteen months he had been coming to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were partly as a result of the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew. The admission of a drinking problem seriously damaged his standing and 25 MPs signed a statement urging him to resign immediately. It was later claimed in a biography of Kennedy by the journalist Greg Hurst that senior Liberal Democrats had known about Kennedy's drinking problem when he was elected as leader in 1999 and had subsequently kept it hidden from the public. On 7 January 2006, Kennedy called another press conference, at which he announced that while he was buoyed by the supportive messages he had received from grass root members, he felt that he could not continue as leader because of the lack of confidence from the Parliamentary party. He said he would not be a candidate in the leadership election and was standing down as leader \\"with immediate effect\\", with Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader until a new leader was elected. He also confirmed in his resignation statement that he did not expect to remain on the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team. He pledged his loyalty to a new leader as a backbencher, and said he wished to remain active in the party and in politics. Campbell went on to win the resulting leadership election, and Kennedy subsequently gave his successor full public support. His leadership had lasted slightly less than six years and five months. when was his resignation?","completion":"Kennedy announced his resignation as leader on 7th January 2006.

Input: Context: Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway activation may promote neuronal survival via neuroprotection during inflammation after cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether IV pretreatment with emulsified isoflurane (EI) could decrease ischemic brain injury related to the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Male Sprague-Dawley rats received different doses of IV EI (1, 2, 4, or 8 mL/kg/h) or Intralipid (8 mL/kg/h) for 30 minutes (n = 6-12 per group), followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 100 minutes to induce transient focal ischemia. The neurologic score and infarct volume were measured 48 hours after MCAO. Immunostaining, Western blot analysis, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to assess EI effects on the cell inflammatory response, high-mobility group box-1 release, and phosphorylated Akt (expression. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was also infused into the ventricular space before EI to determine the effect of EI.', 'Four milliliters per kilogram per hour of EI reduced the infarct size (21.08 ± 11.24 vs 37.09 ± 10.46, P = 0.006), improved neurologic scores after MCAO (1.13 ± 0.48 vs 1.95 ± 0.65, P = 0.015), significantly reinforced neuronal survival (982.7 ± 364.4 vs 439.8 ± 278.4, P = 0.036), and inhibited CD68 macrophage/macroglial infiltration in the ischemic core (188.2 ± 49.1 vs 282 ± 49.4, P = 0.018) compared with the vehicle group. In the EI pretreatment group, the serum high-mobility group box-1 concentration (3.62 ± 0.72 vs 5.73 ± 0.65, P < 0.001) was decreased, and the cerebral phosphorylated Akt level (50.33 ± 4.73 vs 37.5 ± 3.11, P = 0.007) was increased at 48 hours, which was inhibited by LY294002 compared with the vehicle group (5.31 ± 0.72 vs 5.73 ± 0.65, P = 0.216; 43.00 ± 4.84 vs 37.5 ± 3.11, P = 0.091).

Passage: June started with striker Mark Stewart having the second year of his contract cancelled. Following this Turnberry Homes signed a new two-year deal to continue as the club's shirt sponsors. Bobby Barr became the club's second signing of the summer, joining on a year long deal from Raith Rovers. Ross Forbes was announced as the club's third summer signing on 11 June - signing a season long deal nine years after a loan spell with the club. A day later the club's top scorer from the 2017–18 season, Calum Gallagher, signed a new one-year deal. The week ended with Grant Adam becoming the club's fourth signing of the summer, joining on a one year deal from Forfar Athletic. His arrival was followed by that of striker Rory Loy, who joined after leaving Falkirk, however Danny Handling turned down a new deal with the club to join Scottish League Two side Edinburgh City. Stuart Carswell was the next player to commit himself for another season, signing a new one-year deal after 54 appearances and two goals in his 18 months at the club. The following week defenders Ross Perry and Cammy Ballantyne signed for the club on year-long deals, and they were joined by Ryan Thomson who joined after leaving Stranraer. A day after signing Thomson marked his debut with a goal, which was added to by strikes from Calum Gallagher and Iain Russell (playing as a trialist) as Dumbarton overcame Lowland League side East Kilbride in their first friendly of the season.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The formation of caves, particularly in the context of limestone rock, is a complex and fascinating geological phenomenon. The process you have described encompasses several stages that result in the eventual formation of a cave. Smaller fault lines occurring in the surrounding geological structures can have varying effects on this process. In order to assess the impact of such fault lines, it is important to first consider each step of the cave formation process: 1. Presence of limestone: Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate. It is formed through the accumulation and compaction of marine life remains, such as shells and corals, over long periods of time. 2. Rainfall and acidification: As rainwater seeps into the ground and through the limestone, it reacts with dissolved carbon dioxide to form a weak carbonic acid solution. The acidic nature of this solution enables it to dissolve and erode the limestone. 3. Dissolution and disintegration: Over thousands of years, the continued dissolution of limestone by weak carbonic acid leads to the eventual disintegration of the rock, creating voids and passages. 4. Formation of large gaps: As the limestone is eroded away, larger gaps and unsupported spaces begin to form. This creates an extensive network of interconnected caves and passages within the rock. 5. Cave formation: Over millennia, the slow and steady erosion of limestone results in the formation of underground cave systems. Now, let's consider the introduction of smaller fault lines into the mix. Fault lines are fractures or zones of weakness within the Earth's crust, often caused by the movement of tectonic plates. These fractures can directly or indirectly impact the cave formation process, depending on their location and intensity. If a small fault line directly intersects a developing cave system, it could disrupt the natural progression of limestone dissolution and disintegration. In this case, the fault line would be \\"directly impacting a step of the process.\\" The result could be an increased rate of erosion and cave formation or the collapse of existing caves and passages. On the other hand, if the smaller fault lines occur in the surrounding geological structures but do not directly intersect the developing cave system, their impact would be considered \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" This could manifest in a variety of ways; for example, the movement of the fault lines could alter the flow of groundwater, changing the rate at which the limestone dissolves, or the fault lines could cause shifting and redistribution of stress in the rock, which could influence the stability of the cave system. In some cases, the smaller fault lines may not have any noticeable impact on the cave formation process, qualifying as \\"not impacting any step of the process.\\" This could be the case if the fault lines are far enough away from the limestone or if their movement is too insignificant to have any real effect on the dissolution and erosion processes. In conclusion, the effect of smaller fault lines on the formation and development of cave systems will largely depend on their location, size, and intensity in relation to the limestone and underground cave network. Depending on these factors, small fault lines may directly impact a step of the process, indirectly impact a step of the process, or not impact any step of the process at all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: (a). no. (b). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"The given answer options (a) and (b) are not appropriate for addressing the specific questions asked. However, I can provide detailed answers to both questions individually. Question 1: What are the functions of nuchal lines? Nuchal lines are anatomical features of the human skull, specifically located on the external occipital protuberance and along the superior and inferior regions of the occipital bone. There are three nuchal lines: the highest nuchal line, superior nuchal line, and inferior nuchal line. The primary functions of nuchal lines are as follows: 1. Attachment Sites: Nuchal lines serve as attachment points for various muscles, ligaments, and fascia that contribute to stabilizing and moving the head and neck. The muscles connecting to these lines include trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and splenius capitis, among others. 2. Stabilization and Balance: Due to the attachments of various neck and head muscles to the nuchal lines, these structures play an essential role in head stabilization. The muscles allow for the control of head movement and maintain balance, especially during activities requiring substantial head mobility, such as running or swimming. 3. Protecting the Spinal Cord: Indirectly, the strong muscles attached to the nuchal lines contribute to the protection of the spinal cord. The muscles help support and stabilize the head during dynamic movements, preventing excessive strain on the spinal cord or damage to the surrounding structures. Question 2: What are the functions of cartilage? Cartilage is a type of connective tissue found throughout the body, and it has several essential functions: 1. Structural Support: Cartilage provides support to various body structures, such as the trachea, larynx, ears, and nose. It maintains the structural integrity and shape of these body parts while also providing them with some degree of flexibility. 2. Shock Absorption and Cushioning: Cartilage acts as a cushion between bones, particularly in joints, to absorb shock and distribute pressure during movement. This function helps protect bones from wear and tear and allows for smooth, pain-free movement. 3. Facilitate Bone Growth and Development: During the growth and development of long bones, cartilage plays a pivotal role in facilitating bone elongation. The epiphyseal growth plates at the ends of long bones are made of cartilage, which gradually ossifies or converts to bone over time, allowing for skeletal growth. 4. Friction Reduction: Cartilage covers the surface of bones within joints, reducing friction and easing the movement between bones. Its smooth surface and ability to retain water aim to ensure smooth, gliding motion during joint movement. 5. Flexibility: Some areas of the body, such as the external ear and the tip of the nose, are made predominantly of cartilage. This characteristic grants these structures more flexibility than if they were entirely composed of bone. In summary, while both questions relate to anatomical structures, they do not inquire about the same subject matter. Nuchal lines concern specific lines on the occipital bone of the skull, while cartilage is a type of connective tissue found throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it? The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country. In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional...

Is \\"In addition to limiting the total average power used by the device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., that used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the device is first connected.\\" a good answer to the question \\"When is the inrush current affected by the USB specification?\\"","completion":"Yes, this statement satisfactorily answers the question \\"When is the inrush current affected by the USB specification?\\" However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, one could include additional information about USB specifications, inrush current, and the potential impact on various devices. Here's an expanded version of the answer: The inrush current is affected by the USB specification at the moment when a device is first connected to the USB port. The USB specification sets specific standards to ensure compatibility and functionality among different devices and computers. These standards include guidelines on the total average power consumption, voltage levels, data transfer rates, and other aspects related to the performance of USB devices. One such guideline is the limit set on the inrush current. Inrush current refers to the initial surge of current that flows into the capacitors or other energy-storing components of a device when it is first powered up. This initial current is typically higher than the steady-state current, as the capacitors charge up and stabilize the power supply. High inrush currents can potentially damage the power supply system or other connected components, and may also cause disturbances in the electrical grid. The USB specification limits the inrush current to protect both the host device (such as a computer or a power bank) and the connected device (such as a smartphone or a portable hard drive) from potential damage due to excessive currents. This limitation also ensures that the power usage of connected devices is kept within safe and manageable levels. To prevent excessive inrush currents, the USB specification requires the implementation of techniques such as soft-start circuits, which slowly ramp up the input current to the connected device, or limiting the capacitor values in the initial power-up stage. These techniques help reduce the inrush current, preventing potential damage to the components and maintaining the overall integrity and reliability of the USB system. In summary, the inrush current is affected by the USB specification when a device is first connected to a USB port, as the specification sets limits to prevent damage to connected components and maintain a stable power supply. This is achieved through specific guidelines and design techniques that minimize the initial surge of current, ensuring safe and reliable operation of USB devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Justice gave journalists an inside look at the prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib. It is now called Baghdad Central Prison, and has water fountains, a freshly planted garden and a gym -- complete with weights and sports teams' jerseys on the walls. Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Iraqis were thrown behind bars here. There were horrific stories of torture, abuse, execution without trial. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops. Watch how the prison has been revamped ». Detainees were photographed in degrading positions, as Americans posed next to them smiling. The images -- naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution -- caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, commander of the Abu Ghraib prison at the time, was demoted in rank to colonel because of the scandal. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as \\"bad apples\\" -- were disciplined after the scandal surfaced. Rumsfeld later said the day the scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. \\"Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,\\" Rumsfeld said shortly before leaving office at the end of 2006. \\"I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse.\\" The United States always denied it was a matter of policy to torture detainees. But it shut down Abu Ghraib in September 2006 and turned the facility over to the Iraqis. They have revamped and reopened it. Rooms have been transformed and renovated. CNN was told, but not shown, that a few hundred prisoners are here already, in a revamped part of the facility that can hold up to 3,000 prisoners. The capacity is critical to help deal with overcrowding at Iraq's other facilities and the potential security threat. The Iraqi government is going to great lengths to try to change the image this facility has. It organized a tour for journalists, very carefully orchestrated by the Ministry of Justice. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. \\"We want to change its image, to make it a place of justice,\\" he said. A wing that used to hold a thousand prisoners In Saddam Hussein's time now is ready for 160. Cells that used to hold between 30 and 50 people now have a capacity of eight. Prisoners and their families actually get to see each other -- the prisoners behind a cage-like structure, the families on the other side of the fence, in a courtyard with a playground for the children. Again, it is part of the whole effort to create a different atmosphere. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities.

The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

If and be ready to cry or whatever, can we conclude that \\"Most people cry in this situation.\\"?","completion":"In order to conclude that \\"Most people cry in this situation,\\" we must first define the context of the situation and gather substantial evidence to support the claim. The phrase \\"if and be ready to cry or whatever\\" provides an indication that the situation involves emotional response but lacks specific details about the exact context. To make an accurate conclusion, we need to consider various factors, such as the nature of the situation, emotions involved, individual differences, and cultural factors, as emotional responses can vary from person to person and across different cultures. 1. Nature of the situation: Investigate the circumstances that would typically evoke crying or a similar emotional response, such as sadness, loss, frustration, or pain. Examples of situations that may evoke crying include attending a funeral, receiving devastating news, or experiencing rejection. Establishing the type of situation will help narrow down potential reasons for the emotional response and enable us to focus on commonalities among individuals. 2. Emotions involved: Identify the specific emotions that are typically felt in the situation and to what degree. Crying may not always be associated with negative emotions; people also cry from joy, relief, or gratitude. Analyzing the range of emotions involved would help provide a more robust conclusion about whether most people cry in the given situation. 3. Individual differences: Recognize that not all individuals respond to situations in the same manner or exhibit emotions in the same way. Some people may be more prone to cry, while others may express their emotions through alternative means, such as anger, laughter, silence, or withdrawal. Personal factors, such as life experiences, mental health, emotional intelligence, and coping mechanisms, play a significant role in an individual's response to a situation. 4. Cultural factors: Acknowledge the influence of cultural norms and practices in shaping emotional responses. Some cultures may encourage crying and emotional expression, while others may promote suppressing emotions, especially in public settings. Being aware of these cultural differences will be important for providing a more holistic perspective. After considering these factors, gather evidence in the form of studies, surveys, or observations that quantify the proportion of people who cry in the specified situation. Credible data can help strengthen the conclusion and provide insight into whether crying is indeed the most common emotional response in the defined context. A consistently high percentage of individuals who cry across multiple studies or surveys, taking into account the above factors, would support the conclusion that \\"Most people cry in this situation.\\" Overall, an informed conclusion should reflect a comprehensive understanding of the situation, emotions involved, individual differences, and cultural factors, backed by credible data. If it is determined that a majority of individuals do cry in the given situation, it would then be accurate to conclude that \\"Most people cry in this situation.\\" However, without sufficient context and evidence, the statement remains too vague, and drawing a conclusion based solely on the phrase \\"if and be ready to cry or whatever\\" would be inconclusive and unreliable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy. Question: what were the major obstacles facing the Industrial Revolution/ Answer:","completion":"The Industrial Revolution, which represents a significant point in history that paved the way for major socio-economic changes across the globe, encountered several crucial obstacles. 1. Limited Resources: During the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, one of the significant challenges was the availability of sufficient resources. These include raw materials like coal, iron, and other metals, required to fuel the revolution's growing needs. The extraction and transportation of these resources were often logistically challenging and expensive 2. Technological Shortcomings: A lack of necessary technology was another major obstacle. Initially, many machines were either nonexistent or rudimentary, leaving much room for improvement and innovation. Rapid advancements in technology were necessary for better efficiency and productivity, and the delay in these advancements often slowed down progress. 3. Poor Infrastructure: Infrastructure was another considerable challenge. Factories required elements such as roads, railways, and canals for the smooth movement of goods and resources. But in the early Industrial Revolution, these infrastructures were either poorly developed or not existent at all, hampering the easy flow of materials and finished products. 4. Labour issues: The Industrial Revolution significantly changed the labour landscape. However, it was initially marked by relatively poor working conditions, with workers being underpaid & overworked and child labor being rampant. This resulted in social unrest and strikes, which were hurdles to the smooth running of industries. 5. Health and sanitation problems: The rapid urbanization linked with the Industrial Revolution led to serious health and sanitation issues. Overcrowding, lack of clean water, and inadequate sanitation facilities caused the spread of diseases, which could stall the workforce's productivity. 6. Resistance to change: Not everyone was welcoming of the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution. Many artisans and craftsmen, whose livelihoods were threatened due to the shift from hand production to machines, resented these changes. This resistance often led to social and political tension, hindering the Industrial Revolution's progress. 7. Environmental Issues: The Industrial Revolution also faced problems linked to environmental degradation. Activities such as deforestation and excessive use of fossil fuels led to environmental problems like air and water pollution, which had long-term impacts on the earth's ecology. 8. Lack of governmental support/regulation: The government's role during the Industrial Revolution varied, but unexpected changes in governmental policies or lack of proper regulation could act as obstacles. The absence of effective labor laws led to exploitation, while protectionist trade policies could hamper the international export market. These various obstacles meant that while the Industrial Revolution was a time of great innovation and change, it was also a period fraught with challenges that needed to be overcome. Despite these obstacles, the Industrial Revolution propelled humanity forward, leading to enormous leaps in technology, living standards, and the overall global economy."},{"prompt":"In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach? A. not enough information B.

Eines der wichtigsten Ergebnisse der überarbeiteten sozialpolitischen Agenda der Europäischen Kommission ist die Wiederherstellung der Rechte der europäischen Roma als europäische Bürger und das Ende ihrer sozialen Ausgrenzung. Translate to English English:","completion":"One of the most important outcomes of the revised social policy agenda of the European Commission is the restoration of the rights of European Roma as European citizens and the end of their social exclusion. The European Roma, a large ethnic minority group in Europe, has faced significant challenges in the past, including discrimination, marginalization, and social exclusion. As a result, the European Commission has made it a priority to restore their rights and end the social exclusion they suffer. The revised social policy agenda of the European Commission aims to address these challenges by focusing on several key areas. These include education, employment, healthcare, and housing, as well as the fight against discrimination and the promotion of Roma inclusion in the decision-making process. Firstly, the agenda places a strong emphasis on education, recognizing that access to quality education is crucial for the Roma community's social inclusion and economic integration. The European Commission is working to reduce the number of early school leavers among the Roma and improve their access to quality education at all levels, from early childhood to higher education and vocational training. Secondly, the agenda aims to improve the employment situation of the Roma community by promoting their access to the labor market and supporting their entrepreneurship. The European Commission is implementing programs that facilitate access to job opportunities, provide vocational training and work experience, and support the creation of businesses owned and operated by the Roma. Thirdly, healthcare is a vital component of social inclusion, and the agenda seeks to improve the health status of the Roma community. The European Commission is working to enhance access to quality healthcare services and reduce health inequalities experienced by the Roma. This includes tackling issues like low vaccine coverage, high infant mortality rates, and limited access to preventive and primary healthcare services. Fourthly, the agenda aims to improve living conditions for the Roma by promoting access to affordable, quality housing and eradicating spatial segregation. The European Commission supports projects that provide assistance to Roma families in accessing housing and improving their living environment, as well as facilitating the desegregation of Roma settlements. In addition to these key areas, the revised social policy agenda also emphasizes the need to combat discrimination against the Roma, both at the individual level and in terms of systemic discrimination within institutions and policies. The European Commission is working to ensure that Roma rights are respected and protected, and that the Roma community is represented and heard in decision-making processes affecting their lives. In conclusion, the revised social policy agenda of the European Commission is a comprehensive strategy aimed at restoring the rights of European Roma and ending their social exclusion. By focusing on key areas like education, employment, healthcare, housing, and combating discrimination, the European Commission seeks to improve the lives of the Roma community and ensure their full inclusion and participation in European society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the context: How would Remy feel as a result? Possible answers: As playful, upset about the noise, foolish about it The answer is:","completion":"As a result of the given context, it is likely that Remy would feel a combination of emotions after learning that Jesse had fabricated the noise to scare them. Initially, Remy may feel a sense of relief upon discovering that there was no actual source behind the noise they had been told about. This relief could stem from a reduction in fear or anxiety, particularly if the noise had concerned or alarmed them. Knowing that there was no real reason to be worried is likely to alleviate some of their initial distress. However, Remy might also experience a sense of irritation or frustration toward Jesse for having deceived them. Depending on the nature of their relationship, Remy could see Jesse's actions as a playful prank or an insensitive joke. If they view it as a harmless prank, Remy may appreciate the humor and enjoy the opportunity to engage in lighthearted banter with their friend. This response positions Remy as feeling playful about the situation, finding amusement in the exchange. On the other hand, if Remy considers Jesse's actions an inconsiderate or thoughtless attempt at humor, they may feel upset about the noise and the situation as a whole. In this case, Remy could harbor feelings of resentment or disappointment toward Jesse for exploiting their fear or vulnerability, leaving them emotionally distressed. Additionally, Remy might feel foolish in retrospect for having been so easily deceived by Jesse. They may question their own judgment or ability to discern fact from fiction and experience a sense of embarrassment or shame for having been duped. This self-consciousness could lead to feelings of vulnerability or insecurity, potentially affecting Remy's sense of trust in others, especially Jesse. In conclusion, Remy's emotions in this context could fluctuate between feeling playful, upset about the noise, and foolish about it. The specific combination of emotions they experience is likely to depend on a variety of factors, including Remy's personality, the nature of their relationship with Jesse, and the way in which the situation unfolds. Ultimately, their emotional response will be a reflection of their unique perspective and understanding of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"Mohamed Fatahollah Mardani, born on October 12, 1972, is a Singaporean footballer who successfully made a mark in the local football scene. Currently playing for Balestier Khalsa FC, Mardani's extensive career in professional football shows commitment and dedication to the sport. He is currently years of age, a detail missing from the bio, defining his experience and potentially the impact he brings to his current club. Regarding his caps, the bio does not explicitly state the number of caps Mardani has earned. However, caps typically refer to the appearances a player has made in official matches for their club or national team. Given Mardani's background and the clubs he has played for, it is likely that he has a considerable amount of caps, highlighting his consistent role in the teams he has represented over the years. Throughout his football career, Mardani has played for several Singaporean clubs. After playing for Woodlands Wellington from 1996 to 1999, he moved on to Home United in 2003, where he stayed until 2005. Eventually, in 2006, he joined Balestier Khalsa FC, a club he is still associated with. Although the bio does not explicitly indicate his position on the field, an educated guess based on his history as a footballer would suggest that he might play as a midfielder or forward, which are positions that usually have an essential role in creating or scoring goals. As for his current club, Mardani is playing for Balestier Khalsa FC. The club, founded in 1975 and based in Toa Payoh, Singapore, competes in the Singapore Premier League. The team has had various successes, which include winning the Singapore Cup in 2014 and the League Cup in 2013. Playing for a club with a degree of success and history in the Singaporean league no doubt speaks to Mardani's abilities as a footballer.

It is essential to refer to official sources such as the club website, league federation, or other reliable sources to get the most up-to-date information regarding his performances and career progression. Mardani was born on October 12, 1972. Although the bio does not mention his birthplace, it can be assumed that he was born in Singapore, considering his nationality and his consistent participation in various Singaporean football clubs over the years. The bio does not specify the total number of goals Mardani has scored throughout his career. However, goals tend to be a significant performance metric for players who play as forwards or attacking midfielders. To ascertain Mardani's exact goal tally, it would be necessary to consult official records or the clubs he played for to gather this information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings.

Q: Hindi: उसका मुख्य कारण है कैदी बस्ती-जहां पर कि स्वतंत्रता-सेनानी व अन्य कैदी अकेले थे । English: the main reason of which is the Penal Settlement where a large number of freedom fighters and convicts came without their families . A:","completion":"Part #1: Analyze the given Hindi sentence. Usage: The Hindi Sentence is \\"उसका मुख्य कारण है कैदी बस्ती-जहां पर कि स्वतंत्रता-सेनानी व अन्य कैदी अकेले थे ।\\". In this sentence, it talks about the primary reason being a Penal Settlement where freedom fighters and other convicts were alone. Hence the task is to verify this meaning against the provided English translation. Reasoning: It is necessary to understand the exact meaning of the Hindi sentence for validating its correctness in the English translation. Part #2: Look at the corresponding English translation of the Hindi sentence. Usage: The English Translation provided is \\"The main reason of which is the Penal Settlement where a large number of freedom fighters and convicts came without their families.\\" Here, the main theme of the Hindi sentence i.e., referring to the presence of freedom fighters and other convicts in a Penal settlement is correctly translated in English.

Part #3: Check if the English translation has preserved the number as it is from the Hindi sentence. Usage: The Hindi sentence does not specify any numbers which need to be preserved in translation, hence no numbers are present in the English translation. Reasoning: In translation tasks, it is highly necessary to be accurate while translating numbers as they can change the meaning of the sentence if not accurately transposed. Part #4: Assess if the English translation is in sentence case. Usage: The English translation \\"The main reason of which is the Penal Settlement where a large number of freedom fighters and convicts came without their families.\\" starts with a capitalized word 'The' and does not have any other word unnecessarily capitalized, which implies Sentence case. Reasoning: The rules of capitalization vary between English and other languages. Therefore, it is critical to check that the translated sentence meets the general rules of the English language. Specifically, Sentence case mandates that except for proper nouns and the first word of the sentence, all other words start in lower case letters.

Q: Q: What causes high winds and monsoon storms in the desert? A: A:","completion":"High winds and monsoon storms in the desert are primarily caused by the complex interaction of atmospheric pressure systems, temperature variations, and seasonal changes in wind patterns. 1. Atmospheric pressure systems: The Earth's atmosphere consists of high pressure and low pressure systems. High pressure systems are characterized by sinking air and generally stable, clear weather. In contrast, low pressure systems are associated with rising air, which often leads to clouds and precipitation. 2. Temperature variations: Deserts are known for their extreme temperature variations between day and night. During the day, the intense sunlight heats the air near the ground, causing it to rise and create areas of low pressure. As the sun sets and the temperature drops rapidly, the air cools, becomes denser, and sinks, leading to areas of high pressure. 3. Seasonal wind patterns: The monsoon is a seasonal wind pattern that occurs in many parts of the world, including the deserts of Asia, Africa, and North America. Monsoons are characterized by a dramatic shift in wind direction and an increase in moisture, which can lead to significant rainfall and powerful storms. In the desert, monsoon storms are typically caused by the following sequence of events: a) During the summer months, the sun's intense heating causes the air to rise and create areas of low pressure over the hot desert landscape. This acts as a magnet for the moist air from surrounding seas and oceans. b) The seasonal wind patterns, such as the Indian Monsoon or the North American Monsoon, bring moist air inland from the oceans and seas. This increased moisture provides the fuel for storms to develop. c) When the moist air encounters the hot desert air, it rises rapidly, leading to powerful updrafts that can cause high winds and heavy rainfall. The interaction between the cool, moist air and the hot, dry desert air can lead to the formation of thunderstorms, which can produce gusty winds, heavy rain, lightning, and even flash floods. d) High winds can also be caused by the strong downdrafts created by collapsing thunderstorms. As the rain falls through the dry desert air, it can evaporate, cooling the surrounding air and making it denser. As this dense air sinks rapidly, it can create powerful gusts of wind, known as downbursts or microbursts. Overall, high winds and monsoon storms in the desert are the result of the interplay between atmospheric pressure systems, temperature fluctuations, and seasonal shifts in wind patterns, all of which can lead to dramatic and sometimes hazardous weather conditions."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

What is the final step of the following process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process, after multiple thunderstorms come together around an area of low pressure and the storm is fueled by rising air from the warm ocean water evaporating, is the formation of a tropical cyclone, otherwise known as a hurricane or typhoon depending on the region. As the storm continues to intensify, the Coriolis Effect, which is an apparent force caused by Earth's rotation, causes the series of thunderstorms to further rotate around the core or \\"eye\\" of the cyclone. The eye is a relatively calm area in the center of the storm, characterized by light winds, low pressure, and little or no precipitation. At this stage, the system is considered a tropical depression with wind speeds below 39 mph (63 km/h). As heat and energy from the warm ocean surface continue to be absorbed by the storm system, the wind speeds increase. The tropical cyclone's strength is determined by the sustained wind speeds. Once the sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph (63 km/h) or higher, the system is classified as a tropical storm and is given a name. The organized tropical storm becomes stronger, and the cyclonic rotation becomes more pronounced. Ultimately, when sustained wind speeds are 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher, the system attains hurricane or typhoon status (depending on the region). The strength of the hurricane or typhoon is measured on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS) that ranges from Category 1 (weakest) to Category 5 (strongest). Depending on their intensity and location, hurricanes can cause devastating damage to infrastructure, property, ecosystems, and pose a risk to human life. It is essential to monitor these developing storms closely using meteorological data from various sources such as satellites, weather stations, and computer models, as early warning systems and timely emergency response planning can significantly reduce the adverse impacts of tropical cyclones. In summary, the final step of this process is the formation of a tropical cyclone, which can develop into powerful and potentially damaging storms like hurricanes or typhoons. These intense weather phenomena are driven by the combination of thunderstorm activity, low pressure, and warm ocean water providing energy for the system to grow and intensify."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who asks Dillard to install an alarm system?, using the article: The action is set in San Francisco during the 1980s. Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who asks Dillard to install an alarm system?\\" is Garvey, the pawn shop owner. In the article, it is mentioned that Garvey offers Dillard a deal to install an alarm system in his shop, as Dillard is an electrician."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I could nt help but think how beautiful they were . And then I got to thinking how much I m going to miss living here . Moving to New York is going to be a very tough thing to do . Why will you miss New York ?","completion":"The original text states that the speaker is contemplating moving to New York and how much they will miss their current location. The question asked, however, appears to misconstrue the text. If we reframe the question to better align with the original text, such as \\"Why will the speaker miss their current location?\\" or \\"Why do they feel moving to New York will be difficult?\\" it is more appropriate for the context. Assuming the question is \\"Why will the speaker miss their current location?\\", the answer can be derived from the emotions and thoughts that the speaker shares in the text. It seems that the speaker has developed a strong sentimental attachment to their present location, as evident from their appreciation of the beautiful eastern clouds and city lights. One reason the speaker will miss their current location is the emotional connection they have to the natural beauty that surrounds them. The text suggests that the eastern clouds and city lights are something they find exceptionally beautiful, which may not be as prevalent or as readily visible in New York. This comforting view has perhaps become an integral part of the speaker's life, and they may fear losing this connection when they move to New York. Another reason the speaker will miss their current place of residence could be the relationships and familiarity they have developed within their community. Integrating oneself into a new community can be both emotionally and physically taxing, which can be a source of hesitation for the speaker. Moving to a different city like New York likely implies leaving behind friends, family, and places that hold special memories. The unknown can be daunting - especially when it comes to creating a new support network, which the speaker may feel uncertain about building in New York. In addition to the emotional connections, the speaker may also be worried about the practical challenges associated with moving to a city like New York. New York City is known for its hustle and bustle, high living costs, and competitive atmosphere. These factors could contribute to the speaker's apprehension about moving there. Their current location might offer a more peaceful, slower pace of life that they have grown accustomed to and would be unwilling to let go. Furthermore, the speaker might have concerns about the differences in lifestyle that they would have to adapt to in New York. For instance, the high cost of living in New York could necessitate a higher-paying job and longer working hours, which could affect work-life balance. The increased noise levels, potential increase in pollution, and crowded spaces could also affect the speaker's quality of life and create tension around their impending move. In summary, the speaker will miss their current location due to the emotional connections they have built with their surroundings, the relationships they have formed within their community, potential lifestyle changes, and the challenges associated with adapting to the New York environment. These factors contribute to their mixed emotions about moving to New York and make the decision feel difficult and bittersweet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit association which regulates athletes of 1,281 institutions, conferences, organizations, and individuals.

Article:","completion":"Title: Thick Haze Causes Anger and School Closures in Singapore Once upon a time, in the lovely city of Singapore, something unexpected happened. A thick and smokey haze began to cover the whole city. This smoggy air made everything look grey and blurry, almost like when you try to see through foggy glasses. It made lots of people in Singapore unhappy and very angry. You might be wondering, \\"What's the big deal with a little haze?\\" Well, having this kind of smoke in the air isn't very good for our bodies. It's especially not good for kids like you, who are growing and need fresh air to breathe. When we're surrounded by dirty air, it can be hard to breathe or see properly. It can also make people feel sick, and nobody wants that! Because the haze was making it difficult for everyone to go outside and play, the people in charge of the schools in Singapore decided it was best to close them down for a little while. This meant that all the kids had to stay home until the air was clean and fresh again. Now, you might be thinking, \\"No school? That's great!\\" But sadly, the kids couldn't really go outside and have fun either. They had to stay inside their homes with their parents, away from the bad air. This thick haze in Singapore made a lot of people very angry. They wanted to find out who or what caused the dirty air, so they could try and fix the problem. The people of Singapore felt that they deserved to have clean air, so they could go outside and enjoy their beautiful city again without having to worry about getting sick from the pollution. The people of Singapore are still working together to figure out where the smog came from and make the air clean again. They want their city to be a safe and healthy place for everyone to live, work, and play. Until then, they're staying strong and taking care of each other during this strange time. In the end, we can all learn a valuable lesson from the people of Singapore: when something goes wrong, it's important to work together to find a solution and protect your friends and family! And remember, always cherish the clean air we breathe and protect our environment for a healthy and happy life!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Corcoran deal expands GWU’s footprint; U-Md.’s plan for partnership ends suddenly George Washington University’s pending plan to take over the Corcoran College of Art and Design would expand the footprint of the largest university in the nation’s capital. Details remain to be negotiated. But the structure of the deal, announced Wednesday, would make GWU the new owner of the Corcoran’s building on 17th Street NW, next to the White House. It also, according to GWU, would transfer to the university a Corcoran campus in Georgetown on 35th Street NW. Under the deal, the National Gallery of Art would take initial responsibility for the Corcoran Gallery of Art’s collection and acquire a substantial portion of the artworks. The rest would be donated to museums elsewhere, with priority given to the District. For GWU, the value of the real estate in the deal is significant, but the renovation expense will be, too. GWU plans a fundraising effort related to the acquisition. The university, with more than 25,000 students, has expanded twice in recent decades beyond its main Foggy Bottom campus. In 1991, it opened a science and technology campus in Loudoun County through a gift of 50 acres from Charles E. Smith Construction Companies. The campus now encompasses 100 acres. And in the late 1990s, it took over what was once known as Mount Vernon College in the Foxhall neighborhood of Northwest Washington. GWU assumed full control of that 25-acre campus in 1999. Taking over the Corcoran’s college would expand GWU’s academic reach in art and design. But it probably also would add to the fundraising challenge for a university that is simultaneously seeking to raise its game in science and engineering. GWU’s endowment stood at about 1.375 billion last year — the largest of any university in the District and the 55th largest in the nation. The private university was founded in 1821. GWU’s reemergence in the Corcoran negotiations was something of a surprise. The university, by virtue of its proximity, was seen as a logical player in any deal with the financially struggling museum and school. But GWU seemed to cede that role last year to the University of Maryland at College Park, which announced a plan for a partnership with the Corcoran. For several months, U-Md. put significant effort into making the partnership a reality. But its plans were suddenly shelved this week. “Not every courtship ends in marriage,” U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh told the Diamondback student newspaper. “We’re still committed to dramatically enhancing the arts and humanities.” Much remains to be determined about GWU’s transition plans for the students and faculty at the Corcoran.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. - Tsugiharu Ogiwara ( Ogiwara Tsugiharu ) ( born 20 December 1969 ) is a Japanese nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998 . He won the 4 x 5 km team event at the 1995 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Thunder Bay , Ontario . Ogiwara 's best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was 6th at Nagano in 1998 . He had two individual career victories ( 1993 : 15 km individual , 1998 : 7.5 km sprint ) . He is the twin brother of Kenji Ogiwara , a fellow Japanese Nordic combined athlete . - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. What is the relationship between 'tsugiharu ogiwara' and '1998 winter olympics'? A:","completion":"Tsugiharu Ogiwara is a Japanese Nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998. His best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was 6th at the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano.

And a guy being run over by a speedboat *zoom* bloody corpse going down. But besides gore, this flick also contains some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes, filmed in the gray fisher's town that is Vlissingen; Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a milk-can, surrounded by slabs of blood-dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters, in a graveyard. The story is concluded in a frantic, but fulfilling 10 minutes, that don't disappoint, and will leave you sighing a breath of relief. Of course with the pros come the cons, Some special-effects are too over-the-top, and are obviously done to see how far Verhoeven could push the gore-factor (e.g. the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets). Also, while the two lead actors, (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk), do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, the character of Herman (portrayed by the rather un-charming Thom Hoffman) just feels enormously underdeveloped, making him hard to care for, even after his tragic death.

President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made history with their summit meeting in Singapore. But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries. \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize. \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\" It was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague. The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Options: - hungry - peacefulness - religious experience - loss of balance - sleepwalking The answer is \\"sleepwalking\\" because A:","completion":"Going into a trance is often associated with sleepwalking, an unconscious involuntary movement that occurs at night. Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a disorder that causes people to walk or perform other activities while they are asleep. It usually occurs during the deep stages of non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and the person experiencing it remains in a deep sleep throughout the episode without any clear recollection of the event upon waking up. While sleepwalking, individuals often exhibit mechanical actions, slow and clumsy movements, limited response to their environment, and vague communication. Although it is mainly prevalent in children, it can also occur in adults due to various factors such as stress, lack of sleep, alcohol intake, or certain medications. It's important to note that while someone may perform actions like walking or completing simple tasks while sleepwalking, they are not actually conscious of their actions and are essentially in a trance-like state. Since the individual is unaware of their movements, it can sometimes result in accidents or dangerous situations if not properly managed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Washington (CNN) -- When Superstorm Sandy rocked the Eastern Seaboard earlier this week, uncertainty over Tuesday's election began to creep into the minds of those who have spent months organizing it. Though polling places up and down the East Coast were still without power Friday, Sandy's impact is most noticeable in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, scene of widespread flooding, power outages and hurricane-force winds. Elections officials from counties across New Jersey -- especially in the hardest hit areas on the coast and around Manhattan -- are concerned that turnout in Tuesday's presidential election will be affected by the damage.

Explanation: All the options refer to either a location, a network (CNN), or a natural disaster (Superstorm Sandy), except for \\"Election Day.\\" The phrase \\"a change from previous plans to close school for\\" should logically be linked with the reason for the closure, not a location. It wouldn't make sense to say the school was going to be closed \\"for CNN\\" or \\"for Superstorm Sandy.\\" The only option that fits the context and makes sense is \\"Election Day,\\" as schools are often used as polling precincts and might be closed for a day for such a purpose.

Closing \\"for Superstorm Sandy\\" doesn't fit in this context as the storm is already referred to in the past tense, it's not upcoming like Election Day.

Insight into clinical response to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).', 'Matched tumor and nontumor lung tissues from PBC-treated NSCLC patients (four nonresponders and four responders) and tumor tissue from an independent test set (four nonresponders and four responders), were profiled using microarrays. Lysosomal protease inhibitors SerpinB3 and cystatin C were highly correlated with clinical response and were further evaluated by immunohistochemistry in PBC-treated patients (36 prechemotherapy and 13 postchemotherapy). Investigation of the pathogenic and prognostic significance of SerpinB3 was performed in 251 primary tumors, with 64 regional lymph node pairs, from chemotherapy-naïve NSCLC patients using immunohistochemistry.', 'Bioinformatic analyses of gene expression in the training set identified a gene set (n = 17) that separated all patients in the training and test sets (n = 16) according to response in hierarchical clustering. Transcriptome profiling revealed that SerpinB3 mRNA was highly correlated with degree of response (r = -0.978; P < .0001) and was a clear outlier (nonresponders:responders > 50-fold). SerpinB3 protein expression was correlated with clinical response in PBC-treated NSCLC patients (P = .045). Expression of SerpinB3 and cystatin C, relative to the target, protease cathepsin B, was independently predictive of response (odds ratio, 17.8; 95% CI, 2.0 to 162.4; P = .01), with an accuracy of 72%. High SerpinB3 expression levels, invariably associated with chemoresistance, had contrasting prognostic impact in untreated squamous cell carcinomas (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.93) or adenocarcinomas (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.72).

This ratification process could potentially involve various legal and political procedures, such as votes and parliamentary debates, which can also take some time. As the ratification process is vital for the treaty or agreement to gain legitimacy and be legally binding, all parties involved must ensure that their respective legal requirements are met and that national or organizational interests are properly represented.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: At the Academy Awards ceremony on March 27, 1957, Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her torrid, over-the-top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a Texas oil tycoon in WRITTEN ON THE WIND. The 1956 potboiler, adapted from Robert Wilder's novel , was a veritable three-ring-circus showcasing alcoholism, greed, impotence and nymphomania. Malone's performance as Marylee Hadley , a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart, was representative of the movie as a whole. Mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the \\"lowest -common- denominator\\" melodrama, WRITTEN ON THE WIND is ultimately the work of one man, the incredibly gifted director Douglas Sirk, an émigré from pre -World War 2 Weimar Germany who left his European theater heritage behind to pursue a career in Hollywood. An extremely erudite man, Sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as Universal Studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas, most notably with Ross Hunter's productions of MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION , ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and IMITATION OF LIFE . Independent producer Albert Zugsmith offered Sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of Universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult , \\"sensational\\" product , hence the sultry WIND and its follow-up, 1957's TARNISHED ANGELS, both released under the Universal International banner. It's anyone's guess why Sirk didn't pursue loftier themes, but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities. WRITTEN ON THE WIND could be considered Sirk's epic soap opera ; indeed, it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous, perhaps more so. Robert Stack (not an actor typically known for over -emoting) nearly matches Malone in intensity with his offering of the weak- willed brother Kyle Hadley, a mere shadow of his patriarchal father. When he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride ( a beautifully leonine Lauren Bacall ) , Hadley goes off the deep end, escalating an already serious drinking problem with a \\"secret \\" gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb. Both brother and sister, as venal and unlikeable as they are, are presented as victims of their past, giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous ( and far more interesting than the 'good\\" side of the family, mainly Bacall and the impossibly handsome Rock Hudson , young Hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate, a surrogate son to the old man and Malone' s unattainable object of desire. ) Despite all the domestic co-dependency on display , it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed. With a real panache for pictorial composition and editing, director Sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened Technicolor cinematography imaginable : every single shot in this film is an eye-filling canvas of saturated colors, from the sight of a tank-like pink Cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury Miami hotel , a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity. Action and dramatic scenes feature Sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles , shadowy lighting and cross-cut editing , shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious , drunken Malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase ; the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold. What you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind, gussied up in lurid Technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius. Choices: (a). negative. (b). positive.","completion":"(b). positive. The sentiment of the given review is positive. The review provides a strong and detailed appreciation of many aspects of the film 'WRITTEN ON THE WIND,' as well as several of its key players. It talks favorably about Dorothy Malone's Oscar-winning performance, the directorship of Douglas Sirk, and the intensity of Robert Stack's acting. The vivid and overwhelming praise of the film's cinematography at the end with phrases like, 'an eye-filling canvas of saturated colors,' 'riveting,' 'enormously entertaining,' and 'polished to perfection by a visual genius,' further enforce a strong positive sentiment. While there are certain sections where negative aspects are mentioned, for instance, acknowledging the film's excessive melodrama, they are counterbalanced by appreciation for the film's ability to aesthetically present these elements.

I read this background article the other day: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. I am facing a new situation today: A research institute is investigating the effect of alcohol in human body. They gave two groups of subjects, group blue and group red, two different drinks, labeled as blue drink and red drink. The blue drink contained alcohol, and the red drink did not contain any alcohol. Blue drinks were given to the blue group and the red drinks were given to the red group. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which subjects would have higher core body temperature, blue group or red group? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The red group would likely have a higher core body temperature. Since the blue drink contains alcohol and alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate, leading to easier heat exchange with the environment and potentially lowering core body temperature, the subjects in the blue group may experience a decrease in their core body temperature compared to the red group, which consumed a non-alcoholic drink."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and 2000 for women. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Konstadinos Filippidis ( Greek : ; born 26 November 1986 in Athens ) is a Greek pole vaulter . - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers.

Here's why, step-by-step: 1. An ocean is a large body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. Crabs are marine creatures that primarily live in the ocean. 2. The shore line, or coastline, is the area where land meets the sea or ocean. It serves as the boundary between the terrestrial environment and the marine environment. 3. In order for a crab to reach the ocean from land, it must traverse the shore line to transition from the terrestrial environment to the marine environment. 4. Comparing the given options: a. Lakes: Lakes don't directly connect to an ocean, as they are defined by a closed water body surrounded by land. Crossing a lake isn't necessary for a crab to reach the ocean. b. Shallow waters: While shallow waters can be part of the marine environment, a crab must first cross the shore line before entering shallow waters that are part of the ocean. c. Tidepools: Tidepools are small water-filled depressions in the intertidal zone, which is part of the shore line. Before a crab can enter a tidepool, it must first cross part of the shore line. d. Atlantic Ocean: This is a specific ocean, not a boundary or feature that a crab needs to cross to reach the ocean in general.

One mistake that comes to my mind is how we used to produce all our products in-house. That decision had several negative impacts on our operations and growth. John: You're right, Sarah. I remember when we first started the company; we were so focused on maintaining total control over the production process. We didn't realize the time and financial burdens it created. Michael: Not to mention, it limited our ability to scale up and launch new products quickly. In today's fast-paced market, that put us at a severe disadvantage. Tom: Yes, I recall the amount of time we spent coordinating with our production team, managing inventory, and dealing with the increasing overhead costs. It was unnecessarily consuming our resources and energy. Sarah: We also had to invest heavily in machinery, staff, and infrastructure to maintain the in-house production. That made it difficult to allocate funds for other crucial aspects, such as marketing and customer support. John: True.

The \\"Dover House\\" (in Dover, Massachusetts) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948. Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The Solar Two used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules (400,000 kWh) in its 68 cubic metres storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.\\", answer the following question.

Based on the sentence \\"A young girl wearing a white jumper drinks from a straw while other girls congregate behind her.\\", is the sentence \\"A girl wearing yellow drinks soda\\" a true sentence?","completion":"The initial sentence provided is: \\"A young girl wearing a white jumper drinks from a straw while other girls congregate behind her.\\" Then, you ask whether the sentence \\"A girl wearing yellow drinks soda\\" is a true statement. To determine the truthfulness of the second sentence, we can analyze the information provided in the first sentence and compare it to the second sentence. 1. Age: The first sentence talks about a young girl, whereas the second sentence only refers to a girl. Since both refer to a girl, there isn't any direct contradiction, but there is a lack of specificity about the girl's age in the second sentence. 2. Clothing: The first sentence mentions the girl wearing a white jumper, while the second sentence describes a girl wearing yellow. Based on the given information, we cannot confirm if there's any connection between the girl in the white jumper and a girl wearing yellow. 3. Action: In the first sentence, the girl drinks from a straw, which potentially implies that she could be drinking a beverage that can be consumed through a straw (e.g., soda, juice, water, etc.). The second sentence explicitly states that the girl drinks soda. There's no contradiction between the actions, as a girl drinking from a straw may be drinking soda. However, it is not definitively confirmed if the girl with the straw is indeed consuming soda. 4. Presence of other girls: The first sentence highlights the presence of other girls behind the girl with the white jumper, which means there is a possibility that the girl wearing yellow could be among them. Meanwhile, the second sentence does not refer to any other individuals. Though the second sentence - \\"A girl wearing yellow drinks soda\\" - does not directly contradict the initial sentence, there is not sufficient information provided to confirm if the girl mentioned in the second sentence is the same girl, if she is one of the girls congregate behind the girl in white, or if the girl drinking from the straw is indeed drinking soda.

Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? John believes that Bill saw him.","completion":"The sentence \\"John believes that Bill saw him\\" is linguistically acceptable in terms of grammar and syntax. However, the sentence could potentially create ambiguity in terms of its meaning depending on the context in which it is used. Let's break down the sentence and analyze its grammatical components and its potential ambiguity. 1. Grammar and Syntax: The sentence structure is consistent with the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order that is typical in English sentences. In this case, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"believes\\" is the verb, and the content of John's belief (a dependent clause) is functioning as the object. The dependent clause also follows the SVO order: \\"Bill\\" is the subject, \\"saw\\" is the verb, and \\"him\\" is the object. The sentence is well-formed grammatically and adheres to the syntactic norms of the English language. 2. Potential Ambiguity: The sentence becomes potentially ambiguous when considering the referent of the pronoun \\"him.\\" Pronouns, in this case \\"him,\\" are used to replace nouns in a sentence. In the given sentence, \\"him\\" could refer to two different male individuals: either John himself or a third male character not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. As a result, there might be two possible interpretations of the sentence: a) The \\"him\\" refers to John: In this case, the meaning would be that John believes Bill saw him (John). This could also be rephrased as \\"John believes that Bill saw John.\\" b) The \\"him\\" refers to a third male character: In this case, the meaning would be that John believes Bill saw another male individual (not John). Let's say the third male character is named Tom; the sentence could then be rephrased as \\"John believes that Bill saw Tom.\\" These two interpretations are entirely context-dependent, and the sentence could be considered ambiguous without a clearer understanding of the context in which it is used. In conclusion, the sentence \\"John believes that Bill saw him\\" is linguistically acceptable in terms of grammar and syntax, as it follows the typical rules of the English language. Nonetheless, it could potentially be ambiguous, as the referent of the pronoun \\"him\\" remains unclear without further contextual information. To avoid ambiguity, the sentence could be rephrased to explicitly mention the intended referent of the pronoun \\"him,\\" thereby making the meaning clear and precise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ex-South Carolina Officer Is Indicted in Shooting Death of Black Man Prosecutor Scarlett Wilson, Rodney Scott and the Scott family’s lawyer spoke after Michael T. Slager, a former police officer in South Carolina, was indicted in the fatal shooting of Walter L. Scott. A former police officer in North Charleston, S.C., was indicted Monday by a grand jury on a murder charge in connection with the April shooting death of Walter L. Scott, which was recorded by a passer-by and became a resonating symbol in the national debate about police behavior. The former officer, Michael T. Slager, had been jailed on a murder charge since April 7, when the video became public. Mr. Slager’s lawyers have so far made no request for bail, and his indictment in Charleston County had been widely expected. The North Charleston Police Department fired him after the shooting, which city officials criticized in stark and unsparing terms. Despite the intensive publicity surrounding the shooting, Scarlett A. Wilson, the local prosecutor, said Monday that she believed a local jury could be impaneled and would be able to arrive at an unbiased verdict. A trial date has not been set. Under South Carolina law, there is only a single murder charge, which Ms. Wilson described as being an “unlawful killing with malice aforethought” — with the premeditation required to exist for only a few seconds before a killing in order to gain a conviction. “As long as malice is proven in the heart and mind, the state has proven its case,” she said. The case was presented to the grand jury on Monday morning, and the panel returned the indictment within a few hours. “The prosecutors’ work has just begun,” she said. Rodney Scott, a younger brother of Walter Scott, said the Scott family was satisfied with the indictment. “We are happy and pleased about that right now,” Mr. Scott said. In video provided to The New York Times, a police officer in North Charleston, S.C., is seen shooting an apparently unarmed man after a scuffle following a traffic stop. Andrew J. Savage III, the lawyer representing Mr. Slager, said in a statement Monday that he had not yet received material related to the case from prosecutors. “The grand jury is a formal step, but just another step in the criminal process,” Mr. Savage said. “Until we have an opportunity to fully evaluate the state’s case and to compare it with our own investigation, we will not be commenting on any aspect of the case.” The fatal encounter on April 4 began when Mr. Slager, who is white, stopped Mr. Scott, who was black, for a broken taillight while he was driving in North Charleston, South Carolina’s third-largest city. A dashboard camera in Mr. Slager’s patrol car recorded the first minutes of the stop, and the video showed a mostly routine interaction between a driver and an officer. But Mr. Scott, 50, soon fled on foot — his family believes that he ran because of outstanding child-support obligations that he feared would lead to his arrest — and Mr. Slager gave chase. Once the officer caught up with Mr. Scott, there was apparently a tussle over the officer’s Taser. When Mr. Scott turned and ran, Mr. Slager fired eight times; some of the bullets struck Mr. Scott in the back. A pedestrian recorded the shooting and some of its aftermath on a cellphone and provided the video to Mr. Scott’s family, which turned it over to the authorities. After the video became public, many observers focused on a moment in which Mr. Slager appeared to drop an object, possibly his Taser, near Mr. Scott’s body. Critics have also accused Mr. Slager and Officer Clarence W. Habersham, who was the first officer to arrive after the shooting, of providing insufficient medical attention to Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott’s death became a rallying point for critics of police conduct after months of protests about the deaths of black men at the hands of officers in Ferguson, Mo., and on Staten Island. People staged peaceful demonstrations in North Charleston, a city of about 104,000 people, after Mr. Scott’s death. Mr. Slager, a former member of the Coast Guard, joined the North Charleston force in 2010. Before Mr. Scott’s death, Mr. Slager had been the subject of two formal complaints, including one for excessive force after he used his Taser while he pursued a burglary suspect. The city cleared Mr. Slager of wrongdoing in that 2013 case, but the man involved in the episode, Mario Givens, has been among those to announce since Mr. Scott’s death that he would pursue civil litigation against the former officer and the North Charleston authorities. Police records obtained by The New York Times show that Mr. Slager was involved in 19 use-of-force episodes during his tenure as a police officer, including the shooting death of Mr. Scott and the encounter with Mr. Givens. Of those 19 episodes, the records show, at least 14 involved Mr. Slager’s using his Taser in some manner. Mr. Scott’s shooting was the only time that Mr. Slager fired his handgun while on patrol.

The fossil of a 247-million-year-old giant sea dragon discovered in China could be evidence that more species survived during the world's greatest mass extinction. The Nothosaurus zhangi, named after the researcher who discovered the fossil 2008, is described in Nature Scientific Reports as being 22-feet-long. Its unearthing suggests that other marine creatures recovered more broadly following the event known as the Permian–Triassic - or 'The Great Dying'.

It could be evidence more species after 'The Great Dying' The fang-teethed creature would look similar to this and would have roamed the seas around China as many as 250million years ago This was the third largest extinction in","completion":"Earth's history, occurring approximately 252 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period. 'The Great Dying' event led to the loss of around 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species, profoundly reshaping the Earth's ecosystems and allowing new species to evolve and dominate. The discovery of the Nothosaurus zhangi fossil in China not only increases our understanding of ancient marine reptiles that lived in the early Triassic period, but also provides vital clues about the recovery of marine life following this devastating extinction event. The existence of such a large, apex predator suggests that ecosystems had the necessary resources to support various trophic levels, pointing towards a higher level of biodiversity than previously thought in the early Triassic period. This finding contradicts some earlier theories that marine ecosystems took millions of years to recover from the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Instead, it provides supporting evidence that certain species may have been resilient enough to survive and adapt to the radically changed environments following 'The Great Dying'. Furthermore, it opens up the possibility of discovering more previously unknown species from this crucial transition period in Earth's history. The Nothosaurus zhangi is not only an impressive, fearsome predator that lurked in the seas around China more than 247 million years ago, but its fossil also sheds light on how marine creatures like it could have impacted the recovery of ecosystems post-extinction. With its sharp fangs and 22-foot-long body, it serves as an important piece of the puzzle in reconstructing the Earth's ecosystems during this critical period. As researchers continue to locate and study fossils like that of the Nothosaurus zhangi, the scientific community will gain a more comprehensive understanding of both the species that roamed the Earth in the past and the dynamic processes that drove their evolution. The resilience and adaptability demonstrated by this ancient sea dragon offer a stark reminder that life on Earth has survived and thrived even after the most catastrophic events in its history. In conclusion, the discovery of the fossil of the 247-million-year-old Nothosaurus zhangi in China provides fascinating insights into a relatively unexplored period of Earth's history. By revealing the existence of such a large and fearsome apex predator, this fossil not only expands our knowledge of the species that lived during the early Triassic period but also suggests that some species were able to recover more rapidly from the devastating Permian-Triassic extinction event than previously believed. This finding increases the likelihood of discovering more species that survived 'The Great Dying', thereby enriching our understanding of Earth's complex evolutionary history and the resilience of life on our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom didn't want to smell worse after a shower. He decided to just not shower instead. Can we infer the following? Tom usually takes showers.","completion":"Based on the given information, we can infer that Tom usually takes showers. The main points that support this inference are: 1. Tom's initial intention: The narrative begins with Tom's intention to take a shower. This suggests that showering is a part of his usual routine or a common activity for him. 2. Awareness of clean towels: The fact that Tom is looking for clean towels indicates that he is accustomed to using them for his showers. This demonstrates that he has a routine or practice of showering and using clean towels afterward. 3. Recognizing dirty towels: Tom recognizes that the dirty towels smell bad and assumes that using one would leave him smelling worse after the shower. This implies that he has prior experience with showers and understands the importance of using clean towels to maintain personal hygiene. 4. Decision based on cleanliness: Rather than using a dirty towel or finding an alternative, Tom decides not to shower instead. This choice reveals his preference for maintaining cleanliness, which can reasonably be associated with a habit of showering regularly. If Tom didn't usually take showers, he might not have cared so much about the cleanliness of the towels.

Would \\"In a PVC, the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"Yes, that statement does provide a reasonable description of a PVC or premature ventricular contraction. To elaborate, an irregular heartbeat refers to any abnormality in the regular beating pattern of the heart, also known as arrhythmia. A PVC is a specific type of irregular heartbeat that occurs when the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart, contract prematurely. In a healthy heartbeat, the atria (upper chambers) contract first, followed by the ventricles, which allows for efficient blood circulation. This process of the heart contracting to pump blood is controlled by electrical signals. These signals initiate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The signals then propagate through the atria and subsequently through the atrioventricular (AV) node. This results in blood being pushed from atria to the ventricles. After a brief delay at the AV node, electrical signals then propagate down the His-Purkinje network, allowing the ventricles to contract and efficiently pump blood to the rest of the body. A PVC occurs when an electrical signal starts in the ventricles, rather than from the SA node. This leads to an abnormal, out-of-sequence contraction of the heart, as the ventricles contract before the atria have optimally filled them with blood. As a result, circulation becomes inefficient, temporarily reducing the amount of blood being pumped to the rest of the body. PVCs can cause sensations such as palpitations, skipped beats, or the feeling of your heart \\"fluttering.\\" The occasional PVC may not cause significant health concerns, and some individuals may not even be aware they have experienced them. However, frequent PVCs or underlying heart conditions associated with PVCs may require medical attention and treatment, as they can increase the risk of more serious arrhythmias or heart-related complications. Various factors can contribute to the development of PVCs, such as caffeine, alcohol, certain medications, stress, anxiety, and pre-existing heart issues. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional if you suspect you may be experiencing PVCs or any form of irregular heartbeat, to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's start by adding (113 * i) to both sides: -113 * i + 113 * i - 17784 = 199 * i + 113 * i This simplifies to: -17784 = 312 * i Now, to find the value of \\"i\\", we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 312: -17784 ÷ 312 = i When we do that division, we get: i = -57 So, our answer is i = -57."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

The widest part of your boat is the part that will bump into something first along the sides, so you definitely want to place a fender at this section. Placing a fender at the widest part of the boat is essential as it provides the most effective protection against potential collisions and damage. The side of the boat may come into contact with docks, other boats, or obstacles in the water during the maneuvers, and having a fender at the widest point will help absorb and distribute the impact force, thus preventing damage to the boat's structure. It's important to adjust the height of the fender depending on the varying docking situations and water conditions as well. Other fenders can be placed at different points along the length of the boat to maximize protection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"A boy is sitting on an escalator holding a phone.\\", does this mean that \\"There is a phone near the boy.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"A boy is sitting on an escalator holding a phone\\" inherently implies that \\"There is a phone near the boy.\\" In this detailed analysis, we will break down the original statement and explore its various implications, eventually demonstrating that the phone is indeed near the boy. The original statement can be parsed into three distinct components: 1. \\"A boy is sitting on an escalator\\" 2. \\"The boy is holding\\" 3. \\"A phone\\" Each component contributes valuable information towards understanding the overall context of the statement. Component 1: \\"A boy is sitting on an escalator\\" This part of the statement establishes the setting and the primary subject. An escalator is typically found in shopping malls, train stations, airports, or other large public areas. Thus, we can infer that the boy is in such a location. The fact that he is sitting indicates that he is stationary or resting as the escalator moves. Component 2: \\"The boy is holding\\" This portion of the statement provides information about the boy's action. By specifying that he is holding something, we understand that the boy has an object in his possession. The act of holding implies that the object is in his hands or situated close to him physically. Component 3: \\"A phone\\" The third component identifies the specific object that the boy is holding - in this case, a phone. Phones are typically small, handheld devices commonly used for communication and other digital functions. Their size makes it easy to hold and carry with one hand. Now, putting it all together, we have a comprehensive understanding of the statement: A boy is in a public place, likely sitting on a moving escalator, and he has a phone in his hand or possession. Since the boy is holding the phone, it must be in close physical proximity to him. Consequently, the statement \\"There is a phone near the boy\\" is accurate, as it corroborates the original statement that the boy is holding and, therefore, is near a phone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve this algebraic equation for f, you will need to apply the basic principles of algebra which involve collecting like terms and isolating the variable. The equation is: -19f - 399 = 15f - 25 First, you want to get all terms that include the variable f on one side of the equals sign and the constant terms on the other side of the equals sign. You can do this by adding 19f to both sides of the equation and simultaneously adding 399 to both sides. It’s like killing two birds with one stone. These operations will maintain the equality: -19f + 19f - 399 + 399 = 15f + 19f - 25 + 399 0 + 0 = 34f + 374 0 = 34f + 374 Now you have all terms with f on one side and the constant on the other side. Next, you want to isolate f by getting rid of the constant on its side. This can be achieved by subtracting 374 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 374 = 34f + 374 - 374 -374 = 34f -374 / 34 = 34f / 34 -11 = f Therefore, the value of f that satisfies this equation is f = -11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, it's safer but Gazans desperate for gas, cooking fuel, jobs. One woman: \\"Hamas hasn't done anything for us, nor has Fatah\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Navigating the Complex Reality of Life in Gaza: A Year After the Gunfire Introduction: In recent times, Gaza has witnessed a significant shift in the nature of its daily struggles. Wedeman provides a gripping account of the violence, gun battles, and fear that residents faced before the rise of Hamas's control. The landscape of the region has since evolved, with new challenges emerging in the form of dire shortages of gas, cooking fuel, and employment opportunities. Reflecting on this situation, one Gazan woman lamented, \\"Hamas hasn't done anything for us, nor has Fatah.\\" Step One: Delving into the past - Violence and Fear before Hamas Before beginning to discuss the current state of affairs, it is crucial to understand the context in which Gazans found themselves just over a year ago. In the months prior to Hamas's ascent to power, the region was grappling with intense violence, as gun battles were a common occurrence on the streets of Gaza. According to Wedeman, this period saw civilians, including children, scurrying to safety amidst the continuous rattle of assault rifles. Step Two: Establishing the present - A relatively safer environment Fast forward to the present, and the situation in Gaza has somewhat improved in terms of security and ongoing violence. The sounds of gunfire have largely receded, making way for a comparatively more peaceful environment where the residents can now go about their daily lives without fear of being caught in the crossfire. Step Three: Introducing new challenges - Desperation for essential resources However, whilst violence has now subsided to a significant extent, Gazans are facing pressing challenges when it comes to accessing the most basic resources needed for survival. Desperation has set in as residents grapple with a severe shortage of gas required for cooking and heating during the cold winter months. The difficulty of securing steady employment also adds to the sense of despair experienced by the population. Step Four: Calling out the political players - The role of Hamas and Fatah Caught in the midst of these trying circumstances, Gazans are expressing their disappointment with both the ruling Hamas party and the rival Fatah organization. The sentiment that neither has delivered on their promises is ubiquitous, to the point that one local woman bemoaned the fact that neither group has actually improved the lives of Gazans in any tangible way. Conclusion: As Gazans navigate the complex reality of life in a region fraught with historical conflict and socio-economic challenges, it is necessary to look beyond the narrative of overt violence and political strife. One thing remains clear: for the residents of Gaza, survival hinges on the ability of their leadership to satisfactorily address these urgent needs and find lasting solutions to the region's most pressing issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS). - Jacksonville is a seaport city and the seat of Duval County, Florida, United States. With an estimated 868,031 residents as of 2015, Jacksonville is the most populous city in both the state of Florida and the southeastern United States. It is estimated to be the 12th most populous city in the United States and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Jacksonville metropolitan area has a population of 1,573,606 and is the 40th largest in the United States and fourth largest in the state of Florida. The city is situated on the banks of the St. Johns River, in the First Coast region of North Florida, about south of the Georgia state line and north of Miami. - In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which generates a radio frequency alternating current.

Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.

The Mongol invasions of 1236-1241 left the Russian principalities subjugated by the Golden Horde. In the 13th-15th centuries, the Khan of the Golden Horde appointed the Great Prince, who in the 14th century resided in Moscow. In the 13th century the medieval Rus' consisted of a set of relatively small and weak principalities, fighting and making alliances against each other. The larger states progressively conquered or absorbed the smaller ones. One bigger principality, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, grew due to a series of clever policies and became the biggest one in central Rus'. In 1380 Dmitry Donskoy, the prince of Moscow, even managed to fight the troops of Golden Horde in the Battle of Kulikovo and win.

Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (nee Murray; December 9, 1906 - January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist. In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I. Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I. When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \\"was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English.\\" Her idea was not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0. In 1952 she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \\"Nobody believed that,\\" and that she \\"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\\" She goes on to say that her compiler \\"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say \\"Subtract income tax from pay\\" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.\\" In 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.","completion":"This text is about Grace Brewster Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: had to return it Product review: recently had my semi annual physical. thisscale put me at 20+ pounds over my old scale(which the housekeeper dropped)and thescale from my dr's office. it was just thescale i had wanted, and it was a disappointment.returned! Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it would be more likely that the chances of buying the product would decrease. The review highlights a few points which contribute to this assessment, and we can explore these reasons in detail below: 1. Inaccuracy: The key concern mentioned in the review is the inaccuracy of the scale, as it showed a significant difference between the weight measured on this scale and the weight measured on both the old scale and the user's doctor's scale. An inaccurate scale is a major drawback for any consumer who values precise measurements, especially when it comes to monitoring one's health and wellness. Small inaccuracies can be justifiable due to margin of error, but a 20+ pound difference is remarkably wide, which may indicate the scale's unreliability. 2. Disappointment: The reviewer explicitly states that they were disappointed with the product. This suggests that they had higher expectations for the scale, possibly based on the product features, brand reputation, or price. As a potential buyer, seeing another consumer disappointed with a product may influence one's perception of its quality and value, leading to decreased chances of purchasing the product. 3. Returning the product: Another key aspect of the review is that the user had to return the product. This suggests that the issues mentioned in the review were significant enough that the user felt the need to return rather than keep it, which reflects poorly on the product's quality. A high return rate is often an indicator that the product may not meet the expectations of many users, further decreasing the chances of purchasing it. 4. Word of mouth: Reviews play an essential role in influencing others' decisions when it comes to purchasing a product, especially online where potential buyers often rely on others' experiences. A negative or unfavorable review from a user who encountered issues significant enough that they felt compelled to return the product may discourage potential buyers from choosing the same product. Taking these factors into account, this particular review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product. Though it is important to consider multiple reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of a product's quality and performance, a review like this would certainly raise some questions and concerns as other users may experience similar issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Other findings in the WHO study: Suicide is the second-leading cause of death in people ages 15-29; 75% of suicides take place in lower-income countries; and people over 70 are the most likely to die this way. \\"Suicide kills more than conflicts, wars, and natural catastrophes,\\" says WHO's mental health director in Yahoo News. Calling this often-stigmatized death a \\"major public health problem,\\" WHO says its goal is to cut the suicide rate by 10% by 2020. Some of the challenges in combating suicide are sensationalized media reports when a celebrity dies this way and people who are afraid to seek help for an issue that's \\"been shrouded in taboo for too long,\\" according to WHO's director general. One WHO scientist says countries can simply start \\"at [the] local level\\" with small-scale programs, including services for at-risk people who have already attempted suicide. Others say more education is needed, including in schools. \\"There needs to be much more public awareness around suicide—too few of us know how to react when they see someone who may be at risk of taking their life,\\" a suicide campaigner tells the BBC. Expand this summary.","completion":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that every 40 seconds, someone takes their own life, adding up to around 800,000 deaths a year. Suicide is a very sad and serious problem, and it is the second most common cause of death for young people between 15 and 29 years old. Most of the time, this happens in countries where people don't have much money. Older people, above 70 years old, are also more likely to die this way. WHO wants to help people and reduce the number of suicides by at least 10% by the year 2020. But this is difficult, because sometimes when a famous person dies from suicide, the news talks about it too much, and other people may get scared to ask for help if they are feeling sad or thinking about suicide. It is important for countries to start programs that can support and help people who are at risk of suicide, especially those who have already tried to take their own life before. Educating people, including children in schools, about the issue is also important. When more people know how to react and help someone who is thinking about suicide, it can help save lives and make the world a better place."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I tell you that Earthworms have bodies that are segmented, and ask you the question \\"what has bodies that are segmented?\\", is the correct answer \\"fur seals\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"fur seals.\\" The correct answer to the question \\"what has bodies that are segmented?\\" would be \\"earthworms,\\" as mentioned earlier. Earthworms are invertebrates belonging to the phylum Annelida and are characterized by their long, cylindrical, segmented bodies. Their body is made up of many ring-like segments called annuli that are formed by a series of circular and longitudinal muscles. Earthworms have a hydrostatic skeleton, meaning that their body shape and movement are supported by the pressure of the fluid within their coelom, which is divided by internal septa corresponding to the external annuli of the body. These septa provide the separation between the segments and also aid in locomotion. While fur seals, which belong to the family Otariidae, possess a distinctive external fur coat and are marine mammals, it is essential to note that they do not have segmented bodies like annelids. Fur seals have a body structure typical of mammals, consisting of a head, torso, limbs, and a tail. Fur seals primarily depend on muscles surrounding their skeletal system for body support, movement, and general functionality. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"what has bodies that are segmented?\\" is \\"earthworms,\\" not \\"fur seals.\\" Earthworms have a segmented body structure that allows them to move, grow, and perform other necessary functions for their survival.

Supporting details from the context: 1. Megan was eating pancakes in bed: Pancakes are commonly considered a breakfast food. This is the primary clue that suggests that she was having breakfast. 2. Megan's eating situation: Eating in bed also supports this hypothesis, as it is normal to have breakfast in bed during mornings or weekends when people typically relax or take a break from their usual routine. Eating breakfast in bed could indicate a leisurely morning or a special occasion. 3. Time of day: Although the context does not provide explicit information about the time of day, it is reasonable to assume that since pancakes are usually consumed during breakfast time, Megan could be having her breakfast. 4. Clues from Megan's actions: Megan sets her plate on the ground and gets up later. This could imply that she had just woken up and was still in her bed consuming her first meal of the day. Additionally, her blanket falling to the ground could indicate that she was still wrapped up in it while eating, further suggesting that she was eating her breakfast shortly after waking up. While the context does not provide definite proof about the time of day or Megan's specific intent to have breakfast, there is substantial circumstantial evidence allowing us to draw the hypothesis that Megan was having breakfast. In this case, the presence of pancakes, eating in bed, and the possible time of day support the hypothesis of Megan's breakfast consumption.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Bags of Love Last year, I worked in a middle school near my mother's house, and I stayed with her for a month. During that time, I helped her do some housework and buy some food. After the first week, I noticed that the food was eaten up very quickly. Then I began keeping an eye on my mum. To my surprise, I found that she would put some of the food into a paper bag and go out with it at about nine every morning. And finally, I decided to follow her. I saw her taking the food to the street children. She would also spend a lot of time talking and playing with them. One day, I talked to a neighbour and found out that my mum was well-known in the area. The children were very friendly with her and even thought of her as their own mother. Then it hit me - why wouldn't she want to tell me about it? Was she worried that I would stop buying food if I found out? When my mum got home, I gave her a big hug .I told her she didn't need to keep it a secret from me. And she told me something about the children. Some of them lived with an old lady in a small house. Others slept on the street. For years, she was helping the poor street children by giving them food. After she told me everything, I was so moved by how selfless she was. She helped others in need. As her son, I was so proud of my mum. I continued to buy food for my mum after that. But I always added one more bag for her other children.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Harold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 - 13 January 2004) was a British general practitioner and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen murders for killing patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released. The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman's crimes. Context: Shipman hanged himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison at 06:20 on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 08:10. A Prison Service statement indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets. Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated, as his suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of Shipman's confession nor answers as to why he committed his crimes. The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: \\"You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it.\\" His death divided national newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a \\"cold coward\\" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. The Sun, however, ran a celebratory front-page headline; \\"Ship Ship hooray!\\" The Independent called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials. Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, although he had reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his National Health Service (NHS) pension. Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension, to which she would not have been entitled had Shipman lived past age 60. Additionally, there was evidence that his wife, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman had refused to take part in courses leading toward a full confession of his crimes, leading to temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife. During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to \\"tell me everything, no matter what\\". A 2005 inquiry found that Shipman's suicide \\"could not have been predicted or prevented\\", but that procedures should nonetheless be re-examined. Question: What happened with his wife? Answer:","completion":"After Harold Shipman's suicide, his wife Primrose Shipman faced a challenging and complex situation. Throughout the trials and investigations, Primrose had consistently maintained her husband's innocence, despite the overwhelming evidence against him. It is believed that she began to suspect his guilt as new details about his numerous criminal activities emerged. Harold Shipman's motive for suicide was never conclusively determined, but there were reports that he had told his probation officer that he was contemplating taking his own life to secure his wife's financial stability. By committing suicide before his 60th birthday, Shipman ensured that Primrose would be eligible to receive a full National Health Service (NHS) pension. If Shipman had lived past the age of 60, his wife would not have been entitled to this pension. Moreover, due to Harold's refusal to participate in courses that could have led to his eventual confession, his privileges, including phone calls to his wife, were temporarily revoked. According to Shipman's cellmate, during this time, Primrose wrote a letter to her husband urging him to \\"tell me everything, no matter what.\\" This likely implies that she had started to realize the truth about her husband's horrific crimes. Despite facing a profoundly difficult and emotionally distressing situation, Primrose received her husband's NHS pension as a result of his suicide. Following the events, her life remained mostly private, and it is unclear what impact these developments may have had on her life, relationships, or understanding of her husband's actions. As for the public reaction to Harold Shipman's death, there were divided opinions. Some people felt cheated that they would never receive answers or confessions from Shipman, while others celebrated his death. The incident also sparked debates on prison conditions and the handling of inmates in the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Summarize this article: (CNN) First lady Melania Trump has been in the hospital for four days, with no word on exactly when she will be released. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, would not give any details about why the first lady was there, but a White House statement said she underwent an embolization procedure on Monday morning to treat a benign kidney condition. President Trump tweeted Monday that she \\"is doing really well\\" and would be leaving the hospital in \\"2 or 3 days\\" after her procedure. Embolization \\"cuts off the blood supply to a certain part of the body,\\" according to the National Institutes of Health. This procedure is mostly done as an outpatient, meaning the patient is discharged the same day. Dr. Mohamad Allaf, vice chairman of urology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said the planned length of the first lady's hospitalization is \\"somewhat atypical but not out of the question,\\" noting that it's hard to tell absent more information about Trump. \\"It may be just out of an abundance of caution and privacy. Certainly, staying a little longer may imply that this is a little bit more of a complex situation.\\" On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that she was \\"feeling great\\" and looking forward to getting home. It's unclear why she hasn't returned to the White House, and experts say, it's hard to speculate. \\"There are so many unknown factors about what was involved in the procedure. Was she under full sedation? ... There are many factors that could keep someone [in the hospital] in a little longer,\\" said Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urological surgeon at Orlando Health. He has worked with patients under similar circumstances, but is not involved in the first lady's case. Brahmbhatt, also an assistant professor of urology at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, said he would expect some patients to resume some regular activity the day after the procedure. But there could be pain, he said, and to discharge a patient, doctors typically look for three things: \\"They'll be waiting to see how she eats. They'll want her pain to be in control. They'll want to make sure that the labs show she is stable. Once you meet those criteria, then we can send you home,\\" Brahmbhatt said. Dr. Gregory Bernstein , a urologist and former military physician, said he's gotten a lot of questions this week about the length of the first lady's hospital stay. He did not treat her but has treated patients in similar circumstances. He said the case could have been more complicated. \\"Everyone's pain threshold is a little different. An embolization is pretty painful regardless. Think about it. You are cutting off the blood supply to tissue in the body, which cuts off oxygen, which causes tissue to die, and that can be pretty painful,\\" Bernstein said. When his patients ask how long they'll be at the hospital with a procedure like this, he tries to manage their expectations. \\"I always tell my patients to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which may involve having to stay three or four days in the hospital, or they could get out earlier, and then that would be even better,\\" Bernstein said. On the flip side, he said, Trump may still be hospitalized simply because she is the first lady and is in a military hospital that \\"doesn't have the typical constraints of a civilian hospital.\\" Doctors may be taking a little extra time and care to make sure everything is OK with their VIP. \\"She's in a private VIP suite. Why not let her recover there and make sure everything is all right?\\" said Bernstein. \\"Because it would be a lot worse if they let her out right away and she had to go back because of a complication.\\" Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. Dr. Jennifer Berman , a urologist and sexual health expert who is not involved in Trump's care, offered a hypothetical: If a person had a benign tumor that was larger than 4 centimeters, staying in the hospital for three or four days is normal, and Trump would probably be released over the weekend. \\"Since we only have crumbs of information about what the procedure was for, it's hard to know,\\" Berman said. But she hopes the first lady will talk about it someday. \\"Millions of people suffer from kidney problems, and we want them to know there's nothing to be ashamed about, and they should be proactive about any concerns they may have. Often, when celebrities like the first lady have a health issue, it raises awareness, which can be good,\\" Berman said. \\"And she's the first lady, so we are concerned for her health and well-being.\\" ||||| “Usually a one-night stay does more than enough,” Dr. Hong said, “and the next day the patient is discharged with oral analgesics or painkillers. It’s sort of unusual to keep someone longer.” Dr. Hong said patients typically went in for the procedure after experiencing symptoms like blood in the urine or back or stomach pain. Once patients were discharged, Dr. Hong said, he normally would not see them for another month. At this point in Mrs. Trump’s recovery, specialists say it is hard to know why she would remain in the hospital for the better part of a week. It is possible that a patient could stay longer after an embolization procedure if there were underlying medical conditions, or if an infection, pain or discomfort developed afterward, Dr. Joseph A. Vassalotti, the chief medical officer at the National Kidney Foundation, said in an interview. “I would say that I hope that when she is ready she’ll come out and tell the American public about what condition she has and what happened,” Dr. Vassalotti said. Given Mrs. Trump’s desire to keep her private life private, that is probably unlikely. The first lady’s team kept her procedure, and details about when she actually entered Walter Reed, under lockdown. White House aides who were near Mrs. Trump wore blue scrubs in the hours immediately after the procedure, according to a person who saw several of the first lady’s aides at Walter Reed. Wearing scrubs, Dr. Hong said, would be unnecessary for people interacting with a patient who had undergone an embolization procedure. The president visited Mrs. Trump for the first three days of her stay at Walter Reed, stopping on Wednesday for a photo op with wounded soldiers. But on Thursday, the White House offered no further details on Mrs. Trump’s health, and Mr. Trump did not visit. According to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail the president’s travel plans, a weekend trip to Camp David had been canceled and Mr. Trump had plans to stay in Washington. Since moving to Washington with the couple’s 12-year-old son, Barron, last year, Mrs. Trump has made it clear that his privacy is of paramount importance, and hers nearly as important. It is a directive her small team of 10 aides has taken seriously, even as Mrs. Trump’s popularity has surged amid a series of high-profile appearances, including a state dinner with France and the launch of Be Best, her official platform that focuses on teaching kindness to children. |||||","completion":"Melania Trump, the wife of President Trump, was in the hospital for four days.

Write an article based on this summary: – How’s this for a stupid study: Researchers at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, set out to discover the criteria people use when determining that a particular behavior is, well, stupid, Live Science reports. It turns out it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist: Judging whether something is stupid \\"comes instantaneously,\\" researcher Aczél Balázs says. \\"If one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing.\\" In fact, the rate of agreement was 90%, the Huffington Post notes. Researchers found that behaviors deemed stupid stem from three primary conditions: Overconfidence: You thought you could, but you couldn’t. Lack of control: You knew you shouldn't, but you did. Absent-mindedness: You weren't paying attention. In the study, researchers gathered online anecdotes describing behaviors that had been called stupid. They asked 154 students to read them and determine if they were, indeed, stupid. Then, the students chose reasons why a behavior was stupid from a list. Some interesting takeaways: People with high intelligence aren't necessarily immune to doing stupid things. A determination of stupidity is based on the observer’s expectations for a person’s behavior; the person engaged in stupid behavior may have different expectations. Understanding the causes of stupid behavior may help people warn others from engaging in it—rather than saying, \\"You’re being stupid,\\" one can say \\"You’re being overconfident.\\" No matter what, Balázs tells Live Science, we not only recognize stupidity when we see it, we love to \\"watch other people doing something stupid as a source of amusement.\\" (Stupidity may have thwarted a Nazi invasion of Britain. Can't get enough stupidity? Here.)","completion":"Title: The Science Behind Recognizing and Understanding Stupidity Introduction: We've all recognized a situation or behavior as \\"stupid\\" at some point in our lives. But what exactly determines stupidity and how does our brain process it? Researchers from Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, set out to explore this intriguing question, and their findings shed light on how we assess and judge the actions of others. Instant Recognition of Stupidity: According to the research, which was published by Live Science, determining whether something is stupid comes naturally as an almost instantaneous judgment. Researcher Aczél Balázs stated, \\"If one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing.\\" Interestingly, the study found that the rate of agreement in labeling certain behaviors as stupid was at an overwhelming 90%. Three Conditions of Stupidity: By analyzing various anecdotes describing behaviors that people considered stupid, the researchers discovered that stupidity could be categorized into three distinct conditions: 1. Overconfidence: This occurs when a person believes they can do something but ultimately fails, often due to an inflated sense of their own abilities. 2. Lack of control: This is when a person acts against their better judgment despite knowing the potential negative consequences. 3. Absent-mindedness: This refers to situations where a person's lack of attention or mental presence leads to unintended outcomes. The Role of Intelligence and Expectations: Just because someone has a high IQ doesn't mean they're immune to engaging in stupid behavior. The study found that intelligence wasn't necessarily a barrier against exhibiting the three conditions of stupidity. Moreover, a person's judgment of stupidity is often based on the observer's expectations for the individual's behavior. This means that what may seem stupid to one person may be considered reasonable or rational by the person exhibiting the behavior. Improving Communication and Warning Others: These findings could potentially help us better understand the causes of stupid behavior and enable us to communicate more effectively with others. By identifying the specific causes of a behavior, we can provide more constructive criticism and warn others about potential pitfalls in decision-making. Instead of simply saying \\"You're being stupid,\\" one can point out the specific issue at hand, such as \\"You're being overconfident\\" or \\"You're not paying enough attention.\\" The Allure of Stupidity as Entertainment: Despite the negative connotations associated with stupidity, it's important to note that we're often drawn to observing and commenting on the foolish actions of others as a source of amusement. Balázs explains that humans have a natural inclination to watch others engage in acts of stupidity, and our fascination with such behavior is evident in various forms of entertainment, such as comedy shows or viral videos. Conclusion: Understanding the science behind recognizing and categorizing stupidity can provide insights into human behavior and communication. By examining the factors that contribute to our judgments, we can not only become more aware of our own actions but also improve our interactions with others and help them avoid making similar mistakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Directed by Michael Anderson I thought this blatant rip-off was terrible, I'm sorry but I thought it was just plain ridiculous & utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes. The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni & Sergio Donati is so stupid I'm lost for words, the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help & if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whale's are just one more time I'll scream. I'm sorry but I simply don't believe a Killer Whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to & sink it, I don't believe a Killer Whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there, I don't believe a Killer Whale can identify someone's house, know someone is in there & then wreck it on purpose, I don't believe a Killer Whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat, I don't believe Killer Whales can physically recognise people & I don't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, I mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious & things just got so ridiculous that I was half expecting the Killer Whale to write a letter to Nolan to tell him his plan & hand (or should that be fin?) deliver it, the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else. They should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold! Seriously, that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film. I found the film very boring, totally dull & had awful character's with no on screen presence at all. It goes without saying this is a Jaws (1975) rip-off which doesn't even come close to Spielberg's classic. Director Anderson is no Spielberg that's for sure, this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense, scares, tension or atmosphere at all. All the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater & totally forgettable, there's no build up to them & virtually no pay off either as Orca doesn't get to eat a single person. Then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing, the shots of the Killer Whale appearing to cry are pure comedy & the opening scenes of the two Killer Whales I suspect tried to show them as a 'loving' & 'caring' couple but I couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to Killer Whale porn, hilarious stuff. The footage of the Killer Whales themselves is bland & boring, instead of footage which matches & enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else. Do you get the impression that I don't like this film? Good. Forget about any gore or decent deaths either, there's a brief scene when Bo Derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it. This probably had quite a big budget & it still sucks, there's nothing outstanding about Orca, it's well made I suppose but flat, bland & totally forgettable. The cinematography is quite nice though. The acting is bad, Rampling is awful & the late Harris' Irish accent is embarrassing. Orca is a lame Jaws rip-off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made Spielberg's film so good, this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere. Definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as Jaws: The Revenge (1987).

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who studied Celtic culture and language?

It comes a day after Ukraine's state energy firm Naftogaz announced it was suspending gas purchases from Russia. That announcement came after EU-brokered talks aimed at keeping supplies running for three to six months broke down without agreement. Gazprom said it halted the supply because Ukraine did not make an \\"advance payment\\" for July's delivery. CEO Alexei Miller said Russia stopped delivering gas to Ukraine at 10:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday. \\"Gazprom won't deliver gas to Ukraine at any price without prepayment,\\" he was quoted by Russian media as saying. Naftogaz said on Tuesday: \\"Since the additional agreement between Naftogaz and Gazprom is expiring on 30 June, and the terms of further Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine were not agreed at today's trilateral talks in Vienna, Naftogaz is suspending purchases from the Russian company.\\" The Ukrainian firm said it would continue transporting Russian gas supplies to other European customers. It is the second time in a year that Russian fuel supplies have stopped running to Ukraine. Russia cut off gas supplies in June 2014 as the conflict between the government in Kiev and pro-Russian rebels in the east of Ukraine escalated.

Summarize this article: Media playback is not supported on this device Sanchez settled a contentious semi-final 11 minutes into the extra period after Manchester City failed to clear Mesut Ozil's free-kick. Arsenal showed great resilience to come from behind - and eased the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger - after Sergio Aguero raced clear of Nacho Monreal to put City ahead in the 62nd minute. Monreal made amends with the equaliser 11 minutes later as he drilled in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross at the far post - but City were left nursing a serious sense of injustice after this disappointing defeat. They had a goal wrongly ruled out in the first half when Leroy Sane's cross was adjudged to have gone out before Aguero and Raheem Sterling combined to turn it into the net, while Yaya Toure and Fernandinho hit the woodwork after the break. It left Arsenal victorious and Wenger aiming for a record seventh FA Cup triumph. Wenger's future - and the lack of clarity surrounding it - has only been brought into sharper focus by Arsenal's recent fall outside the Champions League places. The manager needed a statement, as did his team, to ease the growing disquiet among Arsenal fans at the prospect that he will extend his stay as manager. Arsenal's Wembley win against Manchester City will not ease the concerns in the minds of the doubters but he can point to the victory, and the manner in which it was achieved, as evidence that he could yet be the man to take the club forward. Victory in the final on 27 May would strengthen his and Arsenal's case for continuity, but for now there was much for the Frenchman and his players to treasure about this triumph. Wenger persisted with an unfamiliar three-man defensive system comprising youngster Rob Holding, Gabriel and Laurent Koscielny and set up his team to deliver an uncharacteristically stubborn performance. Arsenal rode their luck at times - but Wenger will take that all day. Wenger's players have been accused of not playing for him in recent months. No such accusation could be levelled here as they dug deep for victory. The Gunners' embattled manager pumped his fists towards the skies at the final whistle and beamed with delight - he may yet achieve glory amid the worst discontent of his reign. Media playback is not supported on this device Manchester City will argue long and hard that their chances of reaching the final were sabotaged by a first-half decision that saw a good goal ruled out. Referee's assistant Steve Child judged that Sane's cross had gone behind before Aguero turned it back at the far post and then Sterling made sure. Replays suggested the ball had not gone out and City were the victims of an injustice. City will also feel Lady Luck deserted them as they lost playmaker David Silva to injury early on and saw those efforts from Toure and Fernandinho hit the woodwork. In the final reckoning, they must also accept the brutal truth that once more they enjoyed superiority in possession and territory but could not find the ruthless touch. Guardiola, arguably football's most celebrated coach, was brought to Manchester City to lift them to another level - and on that basis his first season without a trophy in a glittering managerial career will be regarded by many as a failure. He has found it more difficult than he may have imagined after the seamless successes of his years in charge of Barcelona and Bayern Munich. He must now address the problems that have undermined City this season, particularly uncertainty over the goalkeeper position, where his decision to replace Joe Hart with Claudio Bravo has been unsuccessful, and also sort out an uncertain and ageing defence. Guardiola's main priority now is securing a top-four place and getting into the Champions League, starting with Thursday's derby against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium. Failure to achieve that objective is unthinkable. Manchester City return to Premier League action with a home derby against neighbours United on Thursday.

Fact: if seeds stick to the fur of an animal then that seed will be transported by the animal Question: A deer created a rose garden by What's the answer?","completion":"Answer: A deer created a rose garden by inadvertently dispersing rose seeds that were stuck to its fur while moving through various habitats. Explanation: The fact mentioned states that seeds sticking to the fur of an animal will be transported by the animal. In the case of the deer creating a rose garden, the scenario likely occurred as follows: 1. The deer, during its regular activities, happened to pass through an area where rose plants were growing and producing seeds. 2. Some of the rose seeds, which are designed by nature to latch onto passing animals, got caught in the deer's fur. This can occur through various mechanisms, such as the presence of hooks, barbs, or sticky substances on the seeds or seed pods. 3. As the deer continued to move through different habitats, it inadvertently carried the rose seeds with it. The seeds remained attached to its fur, with some likely falling off at various intervals. 4. When the deer eventually passed through an area with suitable soil and environmental conditions for the growth of rose plants, some of the rose seeds that had fallen off from its fur were able to germinate and develop into new rose plants. 5. Over time, as more rose seeds germinated and grew into rose plants, a rose garden was formed. This garden was a direct result of the deer's movements and its unintentional role as a seed disperser. This scenario highlights the role animals play in seed dispersal and plant propagation, often over long distances. Such interactions contribute to the distribution and diversity of plant species in an ecosystem, as well as the establishment and maintenance of habitats such as the rose garden mentioned in this example."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina.

A coup attempt typically refers to an effort by a group of individuals or organizations to forcefully overthrow, seize control, or otherwise displace a current government or ruling authority. Step 2: Analyze the information for each specific coup attempt Question 1: Was there a coup attempt in 2012 in India? In 2012, there were rumors about a potential coup attempt in India. Some reports claimed that a group of Indian soldiers was mobilizing to possibly overthrow the government. However, this story was later debunked as a misunderstanding, and no coup attempt actually took place. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is No, there was not a coup attempt in 2012 in India. Question 2: What is the real reason for the July 2016 Turkish Coup attempt? The July 2016 Turkish coup attempt was an actual event, unlike the situation in India, where a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces attempted to seize control of key locations in major cities to overthrow the government. The real reason behind the coup attempt remains debated, but some of the main factors cited are: dissatisfaction with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's leadership, perceived erosion of democratic institutions, and the influence of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish preacher and opposition figure who was blamed by the Turkish government for orchestrating the coup (although Gulen has denied any involvement). Step 3: Compare and contrast the answers to determine if they are the same The answer to Question 1, regarding India's coup attempt, is that there was no coup attempt in 2012. The answer to Question 2, about the Turkish coup attempt, explores the various factors and reasons behind it.

(c). no....I think the answer is","completion":"(c). no The answer is (c). no because the information provided in the statement \\"A young woman reads in the library\\" does not give us sufficient details to conclude that \\"An older woman is sitting at a table having a meal and reading a book.\\" Let's break down the differences between the two statements to understand this better. 1. Age difference: In the first statement, the woman in question is described as \\"older.\\" However, in the second statement, the only age information provided is that the woman is \\"young.\\" This significant discrepancy in age does not allow us to conclude that the two statements are referring to the same individual. 2. Activity: While both women are engaged in reading activities, the first statement specifies that the older woman is having a meal and reading a book, whereas the second statement simply says that the young woman is reading in the library. This mention of having a meal in the first statement is an additional activity that is not mentioned in the second statement, and thus, it is not possible to conclude that the same activities are occurring. 3. Location: The older woman is described as sitting at a table, with no mention of a specific location. On the other hand, the second statement mentions that the young woman is reading in a library. Given this difference in location, it is not possible to assume that the two individuals are one and the same or that their situations are the same. A table could potentially be found both inside and outside a library, but the first statement does not provide adequate information to link the two settings. This distinction signals that we cannot conclude that the older woman's situation is the same as the younger woman's experience. Considering these differences in age, activity, and location, we can confidently conclude that the answer is (c). no. The information provided in the second statement (\\"A young woman reads in the library\\") cannot be used to draw any conclusion about the first statement (\\"An older woman is sitting at a table having a meal and reading a book\\") or vice versa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Phrase: \\"with an original idea for a teen movie\\" Step 1: Analyzing the words - \\"original\\": This word usually has a positive connotation, as it suggests something new, creative, or innovative. - \\"idea\\": This word is neutral, as it merely refers to a concept or thought. - \\"teen movie\\": This part refers to a genre or category of films, which is also neutral. Step 2: Considering the context The context in which this phrase is used matters, as it can potentially sway the meaning towards positive or negative. But, without any specific context, it's hard to say for sure. From the word analysis, it seems that the phrase leans towards a positive meaning due to the inclusion of the term \\"original.\\" However, without specific context, I would consider the phrase to be more neutral with a slight positive tilt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. Canberra ( or ) is the capital city of Australia. With a population of 403,468, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), south-west of Sydney, and north-east of Melbourne. A resident of Canberra is known as a \\"Canberran\\". Although Canberra is the capital and seat of government, many federal government ministries have secondary seats in state capital cities, as do the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to Washington, D.C. in the United States, or Brasília in Brazil. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory. The city's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the Commonwealth Government retains some influence through the National Capital Authority. 1.

Backpropagation, which is used to train artificial neural networks, suffers from the herd effect problem which leads to long training times and limit classification accuracy. We use the disjunctive normal form and approximate the boolean conjunction operations with products to construct a novel network architecture. The proposed model can be trained by minimizing an error function and it allows an effective and intuitive initialization which solves the herdeffect problem associated with backpropagation. This leads to state-of-the art classification accuracy and fast training times.

Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

Since this picture is classified a \\"pure entertainment\\" work and since there are already many comments on it, I'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film. Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. However far away from what I expected, I saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's No.1 Cullinan! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. And they call it humour. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. Hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.

Neil was filled with anxiety when Eric showed up, because","completion":"Neil was filled with anxiety when Eric showed up, because there was a long history of unresolved conflicts and underlying tensions between the two of them, dating back to their days in high school. Even though they were once inseparable childhood friends, their relationship had been strained over the years due to lingering resentment, petty jealousies, and deep-seated insecurities that were never fully addressed, and now threatened their already fragile friendship. During their high school years, Eric had been a popular and charismatic individual, always at the center of attention and drawing in others with his seemingly magnetic personality. Neil, on the other hand, was more quiet and introverted, often feeling overshadowed by Eric's larger-than-life persona. Whenever they hung out together, Neil couldn't help but compare himself to Eric's seemingly effortless ability to engage and charm everyone they met, leading to a gnawing sense of inadequacy that continued to grow over time. Instead of confronting these feelings head-on, Neil had always avoided discussing the issue with Eric, burying his emotions deep within in hopes that they would eventually fade away. However, this eventually led to a festering bitterness that would manifest in passive-aggressive behaviors and snide remarks, pushing the friends further apart as they reached maturity and ventured off to college. Eric, for his part, had always been somewhat oblivious to Neil's internal struggles, assuming that their relationship was still strong despite the changes they were both going through. Unbeknownst to him, these misunderstandings only fueled Neil's anxiety, validating his belief that Eric just didn't care or understand the emotional turmoil he was experiencing. On this particular day, Eric had unexpectedly shown up at Neil's home, planning to surprise his old friend with an impromptu reunion. He was completely unaware of the emotional bombshell that was about to detonate, unfazed by the subtle signals of distress that Neil was sending out. As Neil stood there, feeling the weight of years of unspoken hurt and regret bearing down on him, the anxiety was nearly palpable, threatening to consume him whole. The impending confrontation between Neil and Eric had the potential to mend or irreparably damage their friendship, depending on how they both managed to navigate their emotions and the delicate situation at hand. Neil realized that he had a choice: he could finally face the pain of the past and work towards resolution, or allow the anxiety and resentment to continue to dictate his interactions with Eric, potentially ending their friendship for good. As they exchanged tense greetings and started to catch up on each other's lives since they last saw one another, Neil couldn't help but feel a heavy pit in his stomach. It was now or never. He had to find the courage to confront and resolve the issues that had haunted their friendship for so long, or else he might lose Eric forever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

No one smiled a greeting, and they appeared uninterested in Soapy. One little girl in particular moved like a wisp in the background. The staff informed me that she had been there for over a month and had not spoken the entire time. Her mother said she had talked at one time but not in recent memory. I didn't want to imagine what could have happened to rob this little girl of the natural curiosity and enthusiasm so natural to childhood. Spreading a blanket on the floor, I sat down and put Soapy on the blanket. As the silent child circled past me, I told the group that Soapy would come to talk to them if they sat on his blanket. Several children did this, including the silent girl. She sat rigidly at the edge of the blanket, legs held stiffly out straight in front of her. She was staring hard at Soapy. It appeared that he kept making eye contact with her. She didn't reach out to him or encourage him in any way. Rather she sat tensely, just staring. Finally Soapy came to a stop about two inches from her. He quietly reached out and laid his chin on her knee. I was astonished. While a common behavior for dogs, this is not a behavior exhibited by rabbits, especially not by this rabbit. The child did not reach out to touch Soapy. Instead, she slowly leaned toward him. When her face was within inches of his, she carefully reached out and circled him with her arms. So softly that no one in the room could hear, she began to talk. Folded around the rabbit, she pillowed her head on his back and whispered to him. Soapy remained motionless. I looked up and noticed that the shelter workers had stopped talking. Every adult in the room froze in place. Time seemed to have stopped. The little girl reappeared when I was preparing to leave. She reached her hands out and looked me directly in the eye. I held Soapy out to her. She wrapped him in a big hug and pressed her face against him. Suspended from my hands as... Question: The little girl didn't speak any word because _ .

Which of the following has the lowest mass? Choices: (I) 2 m^3 of bricks. (II) 4 m^3 of bricks. (III) 6000 m^3 of air. (IV) 10,000 m^3 of air. Your answer:","completion":"To compare the mass of each option, we need to know the volume and the density of the material. Multiplying the volume by the density gives the mass. For each choice: (I) 2 m^3 of bricks Mass = Volume × Density = 2 m^3 × 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg (II) 4 m^3 of bricks Mass = Volume × Density = 4 m^3 × 2000 kg/m^3 = 8000 kg (III) 6000 m^3 of air Mass = Volume × Density = 6000 m^3 × 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg (IV) 10,000 m^3 of air Mass = Volume × Density = 10,000 m^3 × 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg Looking at the calculated mass for each choice, we can see that (I) 2 m^3 of bricks has the lowest mass of only 4000 kg. Therefore, the answer is (I) 2 m^3 of bricks. In summary, despite that air has much lower density than bricks, the enormous volume of air in options (III) and (IV) makes their total mass greater than the mass of bricks in options (I) and (II). Furthermore, although the same material - bricks - was used for options (I) and (II), option (I) has lower volume of bricks and thus a lower total mass. So, option (I) 2 m^3 of bricks is the choice with the lowest mass."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Which animal has species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain and Plains, amongst others?","completion":"The animal that has species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, among others, is the zebra. Zebras are part of the Equidae family, which also includes horses and asses. They are native to Africa and are particularly known for their striking black and white striped coats, which may play a role in camouflage, temperature regulation, or social interactions. Each zebra species has distinct features, habitats, and conservation statuses. 1. Grevy's Zebra (Equus grevyi): Also known as the imperial zebra, Grevy's zebra is the largest of the three zebra species. They are found in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Kenya and Ethiopia. Grevy's zebras have thinner, tighter stripes, large rounded ears, and a white belly. They prefer to live in grassland and savannah habitats. This species is known for being more solitary than the other zebras, with male territories often excluding other male zebras. Grevy's zebra is listed as endangered, with habitat loss, competition for resources with livestock, and reduced water availability being significant threats to their populations. 2. Cape Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra zebra): The Cape Mountain zebra, a subspecies of the mountain zebra (Equus zebra), is found in South Africa. It mainly inhabits the mountainous regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. They are smaller than the other zebra species, and their stripes are narrower and more numerous. Cape Mountain zebras have a distinct dewlap, which is a fold of skin hanging from the throat area. Threats to this subspecies include habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and competition for resources with domestic animals. While their population was once severely reduced, successful conservation efforts have helped the Cape Mountain zebra recover to a point where they are now classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 3. Plains Zebra (Equus quagga): The Plains zebra, also known as the common zebra or Burchell's zebra, can be found throughout much of eastern and southern Africa. They are the most widespread and numerous of zebra species, inhabiting various environments such as grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands. Plains zebras have broad stripes that are not as tightly spaced as those of Grevy's zebra, yet not as wide as the stripes on mountain zebras. These zebras are highly social animals and are known for forming harems, which are smaller family units within a large social group called a dazzle. Plains zebras serve as an essential prey species for many predators, such as lions, hyenas, and wild dogs. Currently, they are listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, with their populations mainly affected by habitat loss, poaching for their skins, and competition with livestock for resources. In conclusion, the animal with species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, amongst others, is the zebra. These three species and subspecies exhibit intriguing adaptations to their environments, social behaviors, and various conservation statuses, making them integral components of Africa's diverse and mesmerizing ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative The sentiment of the sentence \\"so devoid of artifice and purpose\\" can be perceived as negative for the following reasons: 1. The use of the word \\"devoid\\" has a negative connotation. It means to completely lack or be empty of something. In this context, it means the subject lacks artifice and purpose, both of which can be considered essential qualities in certain situations. 2. \\"Artifice\\" generally refers to cleverness, skill, or ingenuity. In some cases, it could also refer to an artistic or creative ability. A lack of artifice implies that the subject being described is not skillful or intelligent. This could be interpreted as a criticism or a negative quality. 3. \\"Purpose\\" means having a reason, objective, or a goal. When something or someone lacks purpose, it implies that there is no clear direction or motivation driving them. This absence of purpose can be seen as a negative trait because it suggests aimlessness, lack of ambition or focus, and an overall sense of emptiness. 4. The structure of the sentence conveys a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. The use of \\"so\\" emphasizes the extent to which the subject is devoid of artifice and purpose, highlighting the negative sentiment further. In summary, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative because it implies a lack of desirable qualities like artifice and purpose, suggesting a sense of emptiness, dissatisfaction, and disappointment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Highlight alerts you when people who share your interests are nearby. Banjo lets you see whatever content -- tweets, photos, etc. -- nearby users are sharing. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Sonar, Highlight, and Banjo: The New Wave of Social Apps Revolutionizing Local Connections Introduction: The South by Southwest (SXSW) conference is known for being the launchpad for innovative and groundbreaking apps and technologies. This year was no exception, as three new social apps took the event by storm: Sonar, Highlight, and Banjo. These apps are changing the way we connect with people locally by showing us who's nearby, what they're up to, and who we might be interested in meeting. In this article, we'll delve deeper into the features and capabilities of these apps, showcasing why they were all the buzz at SXSW. Sonar: Discovering Hot Spots and Potential Connections Sonar's primary function is to help you discover what's happening around you and show you the interesting people nearby. The app achieves this by analyzing social media data to identify hot spots – locations where many people are gathering or engaging in similar activities. These hot spots can range from trendy restaurants to popular events. What sets Sonar apart is its ability to suggest connections based on shared interests, friends, and social media connections. By using Sonar, you can find people around you who might be potential friends, acquaintances or business contacts. This allows for a more organic and efficient approach to networking and meeting new people. Highlight: Finding Common Ground with Nearby Users Like Sonar, Highlight is designed to notify you of people who are nearby. However, Highlight focuses on identifying people who share your interests, rather than simply providing a list of nearby individuals. Using your social media profiles and keywords, Highlight analyses mutual interests and notifies you when someone with shared interests is in close proximity. This feature is particularly useful for bridging the gap between online and offline connections, allowing users to connect with like-minded individuals in real life, in a more natural and authentic way. Banjo: Gaining Insights on Nearby User-Generated Content Banjo takes a slightly different approach to local social connections, offering users full access to the content that nearby users are sharing. By integrating with various social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, Banjo displays an aggregated feed of tweets, photos, and other shared content from people in your immediate area. This open and transparent access to local content allows users to get a sense of the activities, thoughts, and feelings of their neighbors and local community. Banjo users can gain insight into what's happening around them and become more aware of local happenings and conversations. Conclusion: The introduction of Sonar, Highlight, and Banjo has undoubtedly disrupted the social app scene, demonstrating the power and potential of localized connections. By enabling users to discover hot spots, connect with like-minded individuals, and access local content, these new wave social apps have revolutionized the way we connect with the people around us. Thanks to these apps, we can now look forward to a more enhanced, personalized, and engaging offline social experience, bridging the divide between our online and real-world connections. It is no wonder that these innovative apps were the talk of the town at this year's SXSW."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. But I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. What is an answer for this question: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information, we can analyze Steve and Chris's requests to understand which of their cups of water will be more dense. Liquid water is a fluid in which the hydrogen bonds constantly break and reform, allowing the water molecules to move past one another. When the temperature of water decreases, the molecular action slows down and the molecules move closer together, causing the density of the liquid to increase. For most liquids, density increases continuously until the liquid freezes, resulting in a denser solid state compared to the liquid state. However, water deviates from this behavior and reaches its maximum density at 4°C. Beyond this point, as the temperature drops further and water starts to freeze, its density will actually decrease. This is because the structure of the ice lattice causes the water molecules to be positioned further apart than when they were in liquid state. Now, considering Steve's and Chris's requests: 1. Steve asks for a glass of water with molecules far apart. 2. Chris asks for a glass of water with molecules closer together. Recalling that water has higher density when its molecules are closer together, and given that it has its maximum density at around 4°C, Chris's cup of water would ideally have a temperature close to 4°C. In contrast, Steve's request for water with more widely separated molecules would correspond to either warmer water (above 4°C, as the molecules have more energy and move further apart) or frozen water (ice). Based on the information provided, Chris's cup of water would be more dense, considering that his request corresponds to water molecules being closer together, which indicates a lower temperature around 4°C where water reaches its highest density. On the other hand, Steve's water would either be warmer or in a frozen state, both of which would have less density compared to Chris's water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Born Lucky: Samantha Jordan's Fortune and Fall from Grace On Samantha Jordan's 21st birthday, she received a life-changing sum of money from her father, Mike 'Flash' Jordan. It's a story that could have been a fairytale come true for many, but for Ms. Jordan, it quickly turned into a cautionary tale. As the daughter of a prominent British wrestler featured on ITV's World of Sport, Samantha found herself thrust into the spotlight, surrounded by well-wishers and envious onlookers. But as the story unfolds, we learn that the true wonders of wealth often come with a price. Mike \\"Flash\\" Jordan: A Wrestler in the 1980s As her father appeared in the spotlight during bouts televised on ITV's World of Sport in the 1980s, Samantha's inheritance was bound to be a significant one. Fans who adored the larger-than-life wrestling star naturally assumed that his fortune would be passed on to his only child. Raised in a world of sports and media fanfare, Samantha's newfound wealth should have been a blessing—she could have used it to improve her life and that of her family, perhaps even branching out and establishing her own name independently of her father's fame. Unfortunately, Samantha took a different path. Misguided Decisions: Blowing Through Her Inheritance The financial windfall that Samantha received from her father was far from small; it was, for many, a life-changing sum of money. And yet, instead of using her newfound wealth to build a future for herself and her loved ones, Ms. Jordan chose a different path. She set about \\"blowing\\" the vast sum on wild parties, ill-advised schemes, and luxurious vacations with friends. As the money continued to dwindle, so too did the number of her friends, revealing the harsh reality that the connectedness and loyalty of many were thinly-veiled attempts at profiting from her wealth. In time, Samantha faced the inevitable truth that the fortune she had been given was gone. With no financial cushion left underneath her, the fall was abrupt and painful. As her finances dwindled, so had her opportunities for redemption and personal growth. Facing the Consequences: A Community Order and Unpaid Work Samantha Jordan's mismanagement of her inheritance led her down a path that ultimately resulted in legal consequences. Her actions saw her sentenced to a 12-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work—punishment, some would say, for the impropriety with which she treated the largesse she had been bestowed. The moral of Samantha's story serves as a reminder to us all: with great wealth comes great responsibility. While the windfalls we receive in life may not always be as life-changing as an inheritance from a famous wrestler, it is the choices we make and the actions we take with those opportunities that define our character. Samantha's cautionary tale offers a salient lesson: the security and blessings of wealth are far from guaranteed. When confronted with newfound means, we must take care to ensure that we remain grounded in our integrity and dedication to ourselves and those around us. For it is those truly valuable qualities that cannot be exhausted—and it is those that shall carry us through, even if fortune ultimately turns against us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, joy and excitement resumed as the playground reopened and the council found that the noise level of children playing was merely 57 decibels, equivalent to a normal conversation or quiet laughter. Body: After receiving the initial complaint regarding the noise produced by children playing, the local council was forced to temporarily close Bakewell Recreation Ground to determine if the complaint held any merit. Many residents were dismayed by the decision, as it threatened to deprive nearby families of a favorite spot for bonding and outdoor fun. The council promptly took action by reopening the site and recording the playing noise to determine if the volume was indeed disruptive for the surrounding residents. To their relief, they found that the noise rested comfortably at 57 decibels, well within the range of a typical conversation or even quiet laughter. To add context, the noise level in question would be comparable to ambient coffee shop chatter or gentle music played in the background. The World Health Organization defines noise levels below 60 decibels as safe and not harmful to human health In fact, 57 decibels arguably poses no significant risk to the well-being and peace of the local community. Conclusion: As the temporary closure of Bakewell Recreation Ground proved to be an unnecessary measure, the council has since reassured residents of the playground's compliance with acceptable noise levels. Families can now return to enjoying their time playing, laughing, and bonding, secure in the knowledge that their beloved playground poses no threat to the community's peace and well-being. Moreover, this incident illuminates the importance of looking into issues more deeply to ensure accuracy and balance, allowing families and communities to thrive together in harmony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How is zinc added to soil?\\" Context: \\"Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Zinc plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of crop plants. Due to its importance, farmers and agricultural experts have adopted various methods to add zinc to the soil, especially in regions experiencing zinc deficiency. The process of adding zinc to the soil can be achieved through both natural and artificial means, as explained below. 1. Natural weathering of rocks: As mentioned, the primary natural source of zinc comes from the weathering of rocks. The naturally occurring zinc-bearing rocks gradually break down over time, releasing zinc ions into the soil. This process enables the soil to absorb and redistribute the essential micronutrient to plants' root systems. 2. Fossil fuel combustion: Humans have unintentionally contributed to the addition of zinc to soils through the combustion of fossil fuels. The burning of coal, oil, and gas releases zinc into the atmosphere, which eventually settles onto the Earth's surface and mixes with the soil. 3. Mine waste: Mining operations, especially those involving zinc-containing ores, generate waste which often contains high concentrations of zinc. When this waste is deposited or improperly managed, it can cause zinc to enter the soil. 4. Phosphate fertilizers: Zinc is often introduced to soil through phosphate fertilizers. Some phosphate fertilizers contain trace amounts of zinc as an impurity. When these fertilizers dissolve in the soil, the zinc becomes available to plants. 5. Pesticides: Zinc-based pesticides, such as zinc phosphide, are sometimes applied to agricultural land for pest control. Once these pesticides degrade or interact with the soil, they release zinc ions that can be taken up by plants. 6. Limestone: Agriculturists might apply limestone to the soil to adjust its pH levels, which can influence the availability of zinc. However, the addition of limestone is a double-edged sword, as it could sometimes reduce the availability of zinc by forming insoluble complexes. 7. Manure and compost: Nutrient-rich farmyard manure, green manures, and compost can also be used to improve the zinc content of soil. As organic matter decomposes, it releases zinc and other nutrients that become available to plant roots. 8. Sewage sludge: Treated sewage sludge, also known as biosolids, could serve as a source of zinc. The safe application of these materials can help restore the soil's nutrient content, which includes adding zinc to the soil. 9. Zinc-containing soil amendments: Farmers may turn to direct soil amendments, such as zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, and chelated zinc compounds, to manage zinc deficiency. These amendments can be applied via broadcast application, band placement, or foliar sprays. 10. Particles from galvanized surfaces: Zinc can also make its way into soil through the erosion or flaking of particles from galvanized surfaces, such as roofs or fences. The zinc particles, over time, find their way into the soil. It is essential to monitor the levels of zinc in the soil to avoid toxicity, as excessive amounts can harm plant growth and quality. Soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and visual observation of plant symptoms can help determine the appropriate amount of zinc to be added to maintain optimum levels for healthy, high-yielding crops."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","completion":"In understanding whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning and relationship between the statements. The premise states that \\"It is slow-moving,\\" while the hypothesis asserts that \\"The thing moves slow.\\" From a linguistic and logical standpoint, these two statements convey similar information, with only slight variations in structure and phrasing. The premise, \\"It is slow-moving,\\" implies that an unspecified object or entity possesses the property of slow motion or progresses at a sluggish pace. This statement essentially characterizes the subject based on its movement speed. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"The thing moves slow,\\" asserts that a specific object (referred to as 'the thing') exhibits slow movement. It may be worth noting that the hypothesis uses a slightly more informal phrasing with the term \\"moves slow\\" compared to the more formal expression \\"slow-moving\\" in the premise. By examining the content and meaning of both statements, we can determine that they are essentially conveying the same idea - an object or entity displaying slow movement. Thus, it can be argued that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Based on this analysis, the appropriate option would be: + yes; As the information in both statements reflects the same concept or belief, it would be accurate to conclude that the premise implies and leads to the hypothesis, even though there are minor differences in the structure and phrasing of the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area. But villagers who work in Chengdu, about 100 miles away, hurried back home Sunday morning, many on foot, the lucky ones on motorbikes, to check on their homes. Song Yuanqing, 43, a worker, arrived back after a 22-hour trip and found his house was still there but had already been very unstable . \\"We would like to do something, but we can't do anything,\\" Mr. Song said as he sat with neighbors around an outdoor fire built by the village leader in his backyard.

Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

Solve -242*w = -133*w - 340*w - 17325 for w.","completion":"To solve the equation -242*w = -133*w - 340*w - 17325 for w, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine the w terms on the right side of the equation. -242*w = (-133 - 340)*w - 17325 Step 2: Calculate the sum inside the parentheses (-133 - 340). -133 - 340 = -473 Now the equation is: -242*w = -473*w - 17325 Step 3: Isolate the w terms on one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 473*w to both sides of the equation. -242*w + 473*w = -473*w + 473*w - 17325 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms. -242*w + 473*w = 231*w (since -242 + 473 = 231) 231*w = -17325 Step 5: Solve for w. To find the value of w, divide both sides of the equation by 231. w = -17325/231 Step 6: Calculate the result. w ≈ -74.89 (rounded to 2 decimal places) Therefore, w ≈ -74.89."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that is made into a statue in the grotto? ? With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi. During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France. Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects.To one side of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by Bernardo Buontalenti.

Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157.

Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq on Monday. President Bush chatted by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while separately two senior Iraq national government figures met with the head of the country's Kurdish region. The diplomatic moves came after Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq on Saturday and Sunday as well as last week. Bush and Erdogan talked about the dangers of the Kurdish separatist rebels along the Turkish-Iraqi border, the White House confirmed. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism, and the importance of the United States, Turkey and Iraq working together to confront the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Bush has vowed to help Turkey fight PKK rebels. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey, with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq. The United States and European Union consider the group a terrorist organization. Last week, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, said his country's maneuvers against Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq were based on intelligence provided by the United States. In the Kurdish Iraq city of Sulaimaniya, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, and Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is Sunni Arab, met with Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani. Iraqi Kurdish officials, while critical of the PKK, have denounced the Turkish bombing campaign. Last week, Barzani snubbed visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in protest of the attacks. \\"We have vehemently condemned the bombardment. The bombing targeted safe and secure areas and innocent people. Several people were either killed or wounded,\\" Barzani said on Monday at a press conference with the others. \\"We held consultations with President Jalal Talabani and we will continue our consultations with other concerned parties to put an end to these aggressions and put to an end the shelling of villages.\\" The three Iraqi officials also dealt with national unity. They signed a \\"memorandum of understanding\\" to deepen relations further with their three parties: Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and al-Hashimi's Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni Arab entity.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Who got a law degree? Options: A. Meade B. his wife C. not enough information D. the brother The answer is:","completion":"A. Meade"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words. Input: The present complexity in designing web applications makes software security a difficult goal to achieve. An attacker can explore a deployed service on the web and attack at his/her own leisure. Moving Target Defense (MTD) in web applications is an effective mechanism to nullify this advantage of their reconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when switching between multiple configurations for its web-stack. To address this issue, we propose modeling of a real-world MTD web application as a repeated Bayesian game. We then formulate an optimization problem that generates an effective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between different web-stack configurations. To incorporate this model into a developed MTD system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for input attacker types with predefined capabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players (defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on CVEs obtained from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also address the issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when fixed, improves the security of the MTD system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about input attacker information.

Write an article based on this \\"The \\"world's saddest polar bear\\" has been moved from a Chinese shopping mall and sent back to the ocean park where he was born.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"The Realm of Freedom: The World's Saddest Polar Bear's Return to the Ocean Park of His Origin\\" The headlines exploded with the news that the \\"World's Saddest Polar Bear,\\" as he had been chillingly dubbed, had finally been moved from the distressing confinement of a Chinese shopping mall to the freedom of the ocean park where he was born. This transfer was an endeavour pursued by a multitude of animal rights activists who tirelessly campaigned for his release, drawing worldwide attention to the plight of captive animals used as public entertainment. The saga of the \\"World's Saddest Polar Bear\\" began when he was first placed within Grandview Mall in Guangzhou, China. His home, a small, glass-enclosed space devoid of any natural elements, earned him his dreary moniker. This was a far cry from the vast, icy wilderness typical to polar bear habitats, and many who heard of his story had their hearts collectively pierced by his pitiful reality. Videos and images of the polar bear, named Pizza, living his days out in poor conditions, separated by glass from the bustling shoppers outside, were quick to circulate around the world. They painted a disturbing picture of an animal projected into a situation that conflicted dramatically with his natural instincts. The impact was immediate and profound. There was a surge of public outrage, spurring many advocates and groups to galvanize their efforts in campaigning for Pizza's removal from the mall. The primary argument resting at the heart of Pizza's case was the glaring disparity between his captive conditions and the natural habitat of a polar bear. Polar bears are highly adapted for life in the Arctic, home to some of the harshest conditions on the planet, with vast expanses of ice and snow, freezing temperatures, and a wealth of marine life for sustenance. Captivity, particularly in a shopping mall environment, is unable to even remotely replicate such specialized conditions, leading to detrimental physical and mental health effects on these animals. Non-governmental organizations such as Humane Society International (HSI) and Animals Asia rallied to appeal the Chinese authorities and the public, pushing for Pizza's return to his birthplace, an ocean park, a more suitable environment for him. Countless petitions were circulated, gathering millions of signatures, and pressure was continuously applied to the concerned parties to ensure the wellbeing of Pizza. Finally, all the hard work paid off. To the relief of many around the world, Pizza was removed from the shopping mall and transported back to his birthplace, the ocean park. His return was hailed as a moment of victory for animal rights, a testament to the power of collective effort, compassion, and advocacy. While his new abode may not perfect replicate the vast Arctic wilderness, it provides a significantly better environment for a polar bear's general wellbeing. Launching from this significant victory, animal rights advocates continue their work globally, hoping to shed light on other animals living in less than ideal conditions and effecting change where possible. The saga of the \\"World's Saddest Polar Bear\\" serves as an alarming reminder of the uncomfortable intersection between wildlife and commercial-centric human activities. It has reignited discourses on animal rights, captivity, welfare, and conservation, sparking renewed global empathy for animals trapped in conditions unfit for their survival and well-being. Pizza’s story is an impetus prompting us to strive towards more ethical interactions with wildlife, ensuring animals have the care, respect, and freedom they truly deserve."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Available choices: (1). no (2). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answer to these two questions would not necessarily be the same. These questions tackle different perspectives on the U.S. involvement in the Middle East, and resulting answers may vary or be nuanced. To answer each question in more detail: Question 1: Should the U.S. be involved in the Middle East? The United States' involvement in the Middle East is a complex issue with various arguments for and against. Proponents of U.S. involvement in the region argue that it is in America's best interest to ensure regional stability, protect allies, and secure resources like oil. They point to the risks of not intervening in the region, which may include encouraging terrorism and worsening humanitarian crises. On the other hand, critics argue that U.S. involvement does more harm than good, often leaving the region more unstable in the long run. They say that America should focus on its domestic issues and not interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. Furthermore, some argue that U.S. presence contributes to anti-American sentiment, exacerbating tensions and conflicts. Question 2: Why is the U.S. so involved in the Middle East? Historically, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is rooted in various factors, such as economic interests, geopolitical concerns, and ideological motivations. These factors include: 1. Resources: The Middle East is rich in natural resources, particularly oil. Access to these resources has been a significant driving force behind American policy in the region, with the goal of ensuring continued access to oil for the U.S. and its allies. 2. Geopolitical strategy: Throughout the Cold War and even afterwards, the U.S. aimed to ensure that no hostile power could control the Middle East, as this would pose a threat to American interests. As such, the U.S. has sought to counterbalance or weaken potential adversaries like Iran and Syria. 3. Terrorism: After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. has focused on combating terrorism and its roots in the Middle East. This has led to military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq and ongoing efforts against groups like ISIS. 4. Humanitarian concerns: The Middle East faces numerous humanitarian issues, such as refugee crises, civil wars, and dictatorship. Advocates for U.S. involvement argue that America has a responsibility to alleviate human suffering and promote democracy in the region. 5. Support for allies: The U.S. has close ties with some key regional allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. Supporting these countries in their disputes and conflicts has resulted in deeper American involvement in the region. In conclusion, the answers to question 1 and question 2 are not the same, as the first question seeks to determine whether U.S. involvement is justifiable, while the second question addresses the reasons behind its current involvement. Each question can yield nuanced answers based on the perspectives and specific factors being considered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings. This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Tops GOP Field in New Hampshire, Second in Iowa: Poll Donald Trump isn’t just the leading Republican candidate in the national polls – a barometer of name recognition – he is now looking strong in the early presidential nominating states where voters are paying attention. An NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday found the New York developer in first place among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and two percentage points behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in Iowa. Mr. Trump carries 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary electorate, a decisive lead over second-place Jeb Bush, who had 14%, the poll found. In Iowa, Mr. Trump is at 17%, with Mr. Walker at 19%. The poll found a strong early showing in New Hampshire for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who at 7% is in fourth place among GOP voters there. Mr. Kasich, who formally launched his presidential campaign Monday, has just 2% support in Iowa, good for 11th place among the 17 Republican candidates tested. Until now, Mr. Trump had been in the lead of national polling but Mr. Walker and Mr. Bush led opinion surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, home to the nation’s first two presidential nominating contests. Mr. Trump campaigned Saturday in Oskaloosa, Iowa, where he attacked the Wisconsin governor for the first time. Mr. Trump said “the gloves are off” after a fundraiser for Mr. Walker called Mr. Trump “DumbDumb” in an invitation to an event later this week. Mr. Trump’s polling rise comes as he seems to have weathered the initial public storm over his belittling of Sen. John McCain’s war record. The NBC/Marist poll was conducted before and after Mr. Trump said Mr. McCain “is not a war hero.” Mr. Trump’s standing in Iowa increased after he made the incendiary remark, though he lost ground in New Hampshire, according to the poll. Perhaps working in Mr. Trump’s favor is that twice as many Republican voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire said they’d prefer a GOP nominee who shares their positions on issues over one who has the best chance of retaking the White House for the party. The polling landmines for Mr. Trump are the same as they have been. Some 44% of the Iowa Republican electorate and 53% of the New Hampshire GOP voters have an unfavorable view of him, far more than the other leading candidates tested. Mr. Bush is next with about one-third of GOP voters in each early state viewing him unfavorably. Among Democratic presidential candidates the NBC/Marist poll found Hillary Clinton with a commanding percentage in Iowa (55%) over challengers Bernie Sanders (26%) and Martin O’Malley (4%). If Vice President Joe Biden was included, Mr. Sanders’s share dropped to just 7%. Mr. Biden hasn’t ruled out a presidential campaign but has done nothing to organize a run. Mrs. Clinton’s lead in New Hampshire is smaller – just 47% to 34% over Mr. Sanders. The NBC/Marist poll surveyed 919 registered voters in Iowa. The New Hampshire poll surveyed 910 registered voters. Each took place from July 14-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. ______________________________________________________ Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. Every time that Jessica would go tanning her skin would break out, unlike Sarah since","completion":"Every time that Jessica would go tanning her skin would break out, unlike Sarah since Sarah's genetic makeup and skincare routine were better equipped to handle the exposure to the sun and the potential side effects. Sarah, being blessed with a more resilient and less acne-prone skin type, could spend time under the sun without experiencing the same negative repercussions as Jessica. One of the primary factors that contributed to this stark difference between Jessica and Sarah's experience with tanning is the variation in their skin type. While Jessica's skin leans more towards the sensitive and oily side, making her more susceptible to breakouts and irritation, Sarah's skin composition is more balanced and less reactive to external factors. This means that Sarah's skin can better tolerate the heat, UV rays, and potential bacteria build-up that may accompany the tanning process. In addition to their genetic difference, another factor that impacts their experiences is their individual skincare routines. Jessica might not follow a strict pre-and post-tan care regimen, which would include exfoliating, cleansing, and moisturizing her face and body to reduce the chances of skin congestion and breakouts. In contrast, Sarah might be more attentive to her skincare needs, ensuring that she uses quality products and thoroughly cleanses her skin to minimize any adverse reactions to tanning. Furthermore, the overall health and lifestyle choices of both individuals can also play a significant role in their response to tanning. Jessica might have a diet that is high in processed and sugary foods, which could increase inflammation levels in her body and exacerbate her skin's response to acne and irritation. Alternatively, Sarah might focus on consuming a balanced and nutrient-dense diet, which would support her overall skin health and boost her immune system's ability to combat any potential bacterial infections associated with tanning. Lastly, it is essential to consider factors such as proper sun protection usage and the choice between outdoor sun tanning or an indoor tanning bed. It could be that Sarah opts for the safer option of using self-tanning products or takes precautionary measures, such as wearing sun protection and limiting her exposure to harmful UV rays while tanning outside. Jessica, on the other hand, might be more careless with her sun protection measures or prefer using tanning beds, which can have negative consequences for her skin and increase the likelihood of breakouts and irritations. In conclusion, several factors contribute to the contrasting experiences of Jessica and Sarah when it comes to tanning. Their genetic makeup, skincare routines, overall health and lifestyle choices, and sun protection practices all play a role in either mitigating or exacerbating the potential adverse effects on their skin. It's essential for Jessica to recognize the triggers behind her breakouts and adjust her approach to tanning accordingly, while Sarah should continue maintaining her skincare practices and taking precautionary measures to ensure her skin remains healthy and radiant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Besides news reports that tend to focus on war or election, Americans generally don't hear much about people in other countries. One reason may be that very little foreign-language literature is translated into English. In the United States, just a few of the titles, mainly translations of foreign novels, short stories, or poetry, make it into English. However, a number of efforts have taken root to try to bring more global literature to US audiences. Ks5u The online magazine of international literature, Words Without Borders, was founded by Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. The nonprofit site, now in its fifth year, offers modern writing from places such as Argentina, China and Italy, often for the first time in English. It gets about 200,000 page views per month and counts roughly 8,000 subscribers , more than one-quarter of whom live in the US. \\"There's a wave of interest right now,\\" says Jill Schoolman, publisher of Archipelago Books, a small nonprofit press in Brooklyn, N.Y., opened in 2003 to publish world literature in translation only. \\"People are hungry for ideas from other countries.\\" Rainmaker Translations, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit, was formed two years ago to support the publication of more top-quality global writing here in the US.

In March, the Center for the Art of Translation, a nonprofit started in 1994 in San Francisco, will publish Two Lines World Library, focused on writing from some particular areas published over the last several decades. Dalkey Archive Press, a century-old nonprofit publisher in Champaign, Illinois, has upped the number of translations on its publication list since 2003, from 25 percent to nearly 80 percent. In recent years, more nonprofits have applied to the National Endowment for the Arts for help to publish literary translations. The agency is also trying to increase the availability...

A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\\"overt\\") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.

For most of us, our grandparents were our first best friends, the ones with whom we shared our secrets and our pain. In majority of the cases, grandparents would have babysat their grandchildren while parents were busy working and didn't have much time for their children. Even as a kid grows up, the love and affection for grandparents never dies, and for many teens, visiting grandparents or living with them in the same house is a pleasure. Kedar Patwary, a mass communication student, says, \\"I often end up having long conversations with my grandfather about the evolution of Indian society and I really admire him for the patience with which he answers all my questions. \\" Many teenagers feel that their parents treat them as grown-ups, while their grandparents give them much freedom.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\") and the answer to that question. Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Problem:Article: Some years ago industries had more freedom than they have now, and they did not need to be as careful as they must today. They did not need to worry a lot about the safety of the new products that they developed. They did not have to pay much attention to the health and safety of the people who worked for them. Often new products were dangerous for the people who used them; often conditions in the work place had very bad effects on the health of the workers. Of course sometimes there were real disasters which attracted the attention of governments and which showed the need for changes. Also scientists who were doing research into the health of workers sometimes produced information which governments could not ignore. At such times, they inquire into the causes of the disasters or the problems. New safety rules were often introduced as a result of these inquiries; however. the new rules came too late to protect the people who died or who became seriously ill. Today many governments have special departments which protect customers and workers.In the U.S, for example, there is a department which tests new airplanes and gives warnings about possible problems. It also makes the rules that aircraft producers must follow. Another department controls the foods and drugs that companies sell. A third department looks at the places where people work. and then reports any companies that are breaking the laws which protect the health and safety of workers. Of course, new government departments and new laws cannot prevent every accident or illness. but they are having some good results. Our work places are safer and cleaner than before. The planes and cars which we use for travel are better. Producers are thinking more about the safety and health of the people who buy and use their products.

Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Here are possible answers to this question: - detestable - enabled - effusive - weird - accidental I believe the correct choice is \\"accidental\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"accidental.\\" An oil spill, especially one considered the \\"biggest ever,\\" typically results in devastating environmental and economic consequences. Therefore, labeling it as \\"accidental\\" suggests that it was an unintended event and not a deliberate act. Let's briefly analyze the other options: - Detestable: This can be an appropriate descriptor from an emotional perspective, as oil spills are generally seen as environmentally harmful and undesirable. However, it doesn't give information about whether it was intended or not. - Enabled: This term generally means to provide someone or something with the means or ability to do a particular action. In this context, it does not make sense, as it doesn't describe the nature of the oil spill. - Effusive: This is an adjective used to describe someone who expresses their emotions in an unrestrained or excessively enthusiastic manner. It has no direct relation to an oil spill and doesn't fit in the context. - Weird: This word is typically used to describe something unusual, strange, or unexpected. Although an oil spill might be unexpected, \\"weird\\" does not convey the nature of the event in an informative way. In conclusion, \\"accidental\\" is the most appropriate choice because it highlights that the oil spill was unintentional, providing valuable context about the incident.

No Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork that typically comes from one of two parts of the pig: the pork belly or the back. Bacon made from the pork belly is typically fattier and more flavorful, while back bacon, also known as Canadian bacon or sometimes rashers, is leaner and comes from the loin of the pig. The statement provided - \\"If used, sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried\\" - does not directly answer the question about what part of the pig bacon comes from. Instead, this statement discusses the use of sodium polyphosphates in the production of bacon and their role in improving the product's properties, specifically sliceability and reduced spattering during cooking. These sodium polyphosphates are a type of food additive that acts as an emulsifier, helping to improve the texture and appearance of the bacon. They can also help bacon retain moisture, preventing it from drying out when cooked. However, their inclusion in the production process is unrelated to the specific part of the pig from which bacon is sourced. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No,' as the statement provided does not address the specific part of the pig that bacon comes from.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Battery operated,flavoured spices\\" correctly answer the question \\"Describe some characteristics of e-cigarettes.\\"?","completion":"The response \\"Battery operated, flavored spices\\" partially answers the question \\"Describe some characteristics of e-cigarettes.\\" A more accurate and detailed response would be: \\"E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices containing cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the best ways to keep your liver healthy is to eat a balanced diet that is low in trans fats and fructose (as in \\"high fructose corn syrup\\"). These substances are found in many processed foods, including chips, soda, fried foods, etc., and have both been shown to contribute negatively to liver function. Processed foods also include a host of other chemicals to maintain freshness and appearance, which your liver has to work to filter out. Your best bet for maintaining liver (and overall!) health is to minimize your consumption of prepackaged and processed foods, and prepare food from scratch using fresh ingredients whenever possible. Organic food is produced using minimal pesticides in the case of produce, and minimal or no added hormones or antibiotics, in the case of animal products. This translates to less chemicals and additives that your liver has to filter out. It is important to note that organic foods still may contain some residual pesticides, and the jury is still out on how much of a health benefit they provide. However, if you can afford to go organic, it certainly won't harm your liver, and you will be helping the environment, as well. A recent study published in Hepatology found that coffee drinkers, including those who drank decaf, were up to 25 percent less likely to have abnormal liver enzyme levels. Researchers do not yet know why this is the case, but drinking coffee may be helping your liver out. Regular exercise not only helps you maintain a healthy body weight, it does good things for your liver, as well. Studies have shown that just 150 minutes of activity per week (that’s just 1/2 an hour, five days per week) is enough to improve liver enzyme levels, and overall liver function. It can also reduce your chances of developing fatty liver disease. As if you didn't have enough reasons to quit already: numerous studies have shown that smoking drastically increases the risks of contracting both cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, and liver cancer. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is usually caused by a virus.

Hoping to end their four-game skid, the Vikings returned home for a Week 12 fight against the Arizona Cardinals. This game was notable for the return of Head Coach Dennis Green, who formerly coached the Vikings and now works for the Cardinals. Right out of the gate, the Vikes trailed early as Cardinals RB J.J. Arrington returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings would respond with RB Chester Taylor getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Cards kicker Neil Rackers helped increase Arizona's lead with a 21-yard and a 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Minnesota struck back with QB Brad Johnson completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson. In the third quarter, the Vikings took the lead with Johnson completing a 9-yard TD pass to rookie WR Billy McMullen, while kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal.

Options: - hotel - train station - opera house - end of line - city Explain why a human would choose \\"train station\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"train station\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical option among the given choices. Many people travel by train, and they often bring suitcases with them to carry their belongings for the journey. The ticket office at a train station is where passengers purchase tickets for their trips. Hence, the presence of both a ticket office and people with suitcases would be most commonly found at a train station. In contrast, the other options are less likely to fit the description: - Hotel: While people with suitcases can be found at hotels, typically there is no ticket office for transportation services. - Opera house: Though there may be a ticket office for purchasing show tickets, it is unlikely to see people with suitcases at an opera house, as the primary purpose is attending a performance, not traveling. - End of line: This term could refer to the last stop on a train or bus route. However, it doesn't necessarily imply the presence of a ticket office. - City: While suitcases and ticket offices may be found in a city, the term 'city' is too broad, and a train station would be a better, more specific answer to the question.

On September 30, 1581, Nobunaga launched his own invasion of Iga on a much larger scale. The immediate trigger for this second invasion was a visit by two residents of Iga the month before to Nobunaga's stronghold in Azuchi during which the men offered to serve as guides for an invasion of the province. Nobunaga agreed and rewarded the men. By this time Oda was at the height of his power. He controlled most of central Japan, including all of the territories that bordered Iga. He was therefore able to assemble a large army which attacked the province from all directions: 1. 10,000 men under the command of Nobukatsu and Tsuda Nobusumi entering from Ise to the southeast.2. 12,000 men under Niwa Nagahide and Takigawa Kazumasu entering from Tsuge to the northeast.3. 7,000 men under Gamō Ujisato and Wakisaka Yasuharu entering from Tamataki to the north.4. 3,700 men under Tsutsui Junkei entering from Kasama to the southwest.5. 7,000 men under Asano Nagamasa entering from Hase to the southwest.6. 2,300 men under Hori Hidemasa entering from Tarao to the northwest. Against this large army of 42,000 men, the Iga defenders only totaled 10,000 at most, and these were spread throughout the province. The Oda forces advanced, torching castles, shrines, and temples, and meeting relatively little resistance. The most significant military actions were the siege of Hijiyama Castle, which had become the rallying point for the northern Iga forces, and the siege of Kashiwara Castle in the south. With the surrender of the forces in Kashiwara Castle on October 8, organized Iga resistance came to an end.

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final.

Question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Write a summary based on this article: The mayor says his series of ordeals will make him more sympathetic to other people’s troubles. “It’s going to make me a better mayor,” he said. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post) Fairfax City Mayor R. Scott Silverthorne was riding high last spring, basking in the success of a popular new park he had championed in the quiet bedroom community 20 miles west of the District. He had weathered public criticism over the city’s decision to sell land it owned in Loudoun County without a public bidding process, and he was busy weighing whether proposals for new businesses and homes would detract from the community’s small-town charm. When he noticed a small lump on his neck one morning, Silverthorne chose to ignore it. The lump would turn out to be the first in a series of challenges that demanded his attention and would end up changing his life. In late June, Silverthorne was laid off from his job as a director of recruitment with the National Association of Manufacturers. By September, he owed about 58,000 to various creditors and filed for federal bankruptcy protection. A few weeks later, the bank foreclosed on Silverthorne’s five-bedroom house. The mayor moved into a nearby townhouse with a friend. Meanwhile, the lump in his neck had grown bigger and become painful. Friends noticed that he was losing energy and had lost 35 pounds. In late October, Silverthorne visited an oncologist, who diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the neck, a sometimes aggressive but nonlethal form of cancer. Fairfax Mayor Scott Silverthorne watches video of a previous city council meeting while being treated for cancer in Fairfax, Va. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post) Reaction in the town of 23,500 has ranged from sympathy to questions about whether Silverthorne should give up his mayoral duties to focus on his health and financial stability. “It’s been a terrible year for me,” Silverthorne said. “There’s no question about it. I can try to sugarcoat it as best I can, but the facts speak for themselves.” As a boy, Silverthorne learned politics through watching his father, the late Frederick W. Silverthorne, who was mayor of Fairfax City in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In dealing with cancer, the 50-year-old Democrat used as a role model a Republican political leader from across the Potomac River: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who since June has waged a very public battle with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. “I thought he handled it with class,” Silverthorne said of Hogan, whose cancer is in remission. “Very dignified.” [Hogan: ‘I never expected to be in this position’] Like Hogan, Silverthorne announced his diagnosis on television — in his case at the start of a city council meeting broadcast live on the city’s government access TV station on Nov. 17, Silverthorne’s 50th birthday. Former Fairfax City police chief Rick Rappoport, right, shares a laugh with city councilmember Jeff Greenfield, center, and Scott Silverthorne, the city mayor, who has been undergoing treatment for a cancerous tumor. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post) “Every party has a pooper, and tonight that pooper is going to me,” Silverthorne began, after the Pledge of Allegiance. He then relayed the details of his prognosis and his intention to seek a third term in office in the spring. “I’m not looking for your sympathy,” Silverthorne added. “But I do believe in the positive power of prayer.” Complete strangers emailed their get-well wishes, Silverthorne said. People showed up at council meetings to express their support. “You’re getting a lot of prayers out here,” Allen Griffith, a local advocate for the homeless, told the mayor during a city council meeting this month. “We’re thinking of you, sir. Get well.” Sounding sheepish, Silverthorne replied: “I really am grateful.” Jeff Greenfield, a city council member who grew up on the same Fairfax City block as the mayor, said the outpouring is to be expected in a close-knit city where many families have stayed for generations. “We rally behind people in a time of need, and the mayor is no different in that regard,” Greenfield said, describing how the community supported his family when his daughter underwent a series of heart surgeries years ago. At the same time, the mayor’s critics are raising questions about aspects of his situation, especially his financial problems, which he has not discussed much in public. “A lot of people have asked me: ‘Is it true the mayor lost his home in foreclosure? Is it true the mayor is in bankruptcy?’ ” said Nancy Loftus, a city council member and frequent critic of Silverthorne, especially on the 2014 land deal with Loudoun. [Residents say they didn’t have enough voice in 30 million land deal] She predicted that the mayor’s situation could become a campaign issue next year, although she also said she thought Silverthorne’s illness might leave people unwilling to openly question him. Silverthorne admits to battling nausea from his medical treatments but said that he’s fully capable of remaining at the city’s helm. He’s looking for work, he said, and recently applied to become a substitute teacher with Fairfax County’s public school system. The pay isn’t much, but it’s more than the 541 per month he receives as mayor. He said he thinks his combination of ordeals will only make him more sympathetic to other people. “It’s going to make me a better mayor,” he said. During a recent chemotherapy session, the mayor ticked off plans to bring high-density developers to Fairfax City and talked about whether the community of shopping centers and Civil War monuments could become a magnet for millennials. “If I could use this time period to cajole and arm-twist, where people are hopefully going to say: ‘Well, we don’t want to go against Scott right now because he’s not feeling well’?” Silverthorne said, as nurses helped other patients nearby. “At the end of the day, the mayor has the bully pulpit, and I should use it.” Correction: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly described the type of cancer that Fairfax Mayor Scott Silverthorne has. It is squamous cell carcinoma of the neck. The article has been corrected. ||||| R. Scott Silverthorne has appointed Jeffrey C. Greenfield as Acting Mayor for the City of Fairfax and has announced his resignation effective at noon on Thursday, August 12, 2016. Silverthorne served nine full terms on the City Council, from 1990-2008, and a partial term from 2011-12. In 2016, he was elected to his third term as Mayor. As Mayor, Silverthorne has pursued opportunities to make local government more efficient. Specifically, he facilitated a review of regulatory burdens for starting or expanding businesses within the city and has been a strong advocate for a vibrant business community. Silverthorne supported strategic economic development initiatives; he worked closely with residents and businesses to grow our local economy keeping the city competitive while maintaining the unique character and nature that makes Fairfax attractive to families. Silverthorne’s efforts included the continued revitalization of the historic downtown and the redevelopment of aging commercial centers throughout the city. Silverthorne has been a champion for quality of life issues as well. Under his tenure, parks, recreation and cultural activities in the city flourished. Silverthorne was the lead sponsor of the city's successful open space referendum in 2000, which created a dedicated funding source for the preservation of open space and added an additional 45 acres of open space for future generations. Under Silverthorne’s leadership, and with the support of members of the City Council, the city developed the central Old Town Square Park. Situated in the heart of the city’s historic downtown, Old Town Square provides a place for social interaction, business promotion, and civic pride. He also recognizes the importance of connecting communities. As Mayor, he strongly supports building more trails and sidewalks to encourage a more walkable, pedestrian-friendly community promoting a healthy lifestyle and cultivating a more livable city. A native of Fairfax, Silverthorne received a degree in business administration in 1988 from Radford University. |||||","completion":"Fairfax City Mayor R. Scott Silverthorne began his time in office with significant successes, such as the creation of a new park and weathering criticisms over a land sale. However, a series of personal challenges would prove to test and ultimately change him. Ignoring a small lump on his neck, Silverthorne continued his work while facing a layoff from his job as a director of recruitment for the National Association of Manufacturers. His debt reached 58,000, leading to bankruptcy and the foreclosure of his home. Eventually, the ignored lump on Silverthorne's neck became larger and painful, prompting an oncologist visit that led to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck, a nonlethal but sometimes aggressive form of cancer. As he went public with his diagnosis and received support from the community, some town residents questioned if Silverthorne should step down from his mayoral duties to focus on his health and financial stability. Despite these challenges, Silverthorne determined that remaining in office would be best and that his experiences would enable him to better understand and empathize with the troubles of others. He continued to pursue improvements for Fairfax City while undergoing cancer treatments, focusing on revitalizing the historic downtown area, promoting economic development, and ensuring growth without sacrificing the small-town charm of the community. During his tenure, Silverthorne has advocated for quality of life improvements, more efficient local government, and economic incentives for businesses. Through his personal struggles, he has remained confident in his ability to serve Fairfax City and believes that his ordeals will ultimately make him a better mayor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Three men were wounded in the shooting at a crowded bar in Olathe on Wednesday night and one of them later died. A barman told local media a man used racial slurs before opening fire. Two of the victims, including the deceased, are Indian. Adam Purinton, 51, has been charged with premeditated first-degree murder and the FBI is investigating a motive. Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, died while his friend Alok Madasani, 32, remains in hospital in a stable condition. The two men were engineers at US technology company Garmin and studied in India, according to their social media profiles. The other injured man, Ian Grillot, 24, had apparently intervened to stop the violence, according to witnesses. Speaking from his hospital bed to local TV News channel KMBC, he brushed aside suggestions that he was a hero. \\"I was just doing what anyone should have done for another human being,\\" he said. \\"It's not about where he's from or his ethnicity. \\"We're all humans. So I just felt I did what was naturally right to do.\\" Mr Purinton is accused of shooting customers at Austin's Bar and Grill as they watched the University of Kansas basketball team play on television. A bystander told the Kansas City Star that just before opening fire the gunman shouted: \\"Get out of my country.\\" The suspect allegedly fled on foot and was arrested five hours later at an Applebee's restaurant just over the state border, 80 miles (130km) away in Clinton, Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported that he told a staff member at the dining chain he needed a place to hide because he had killed two Middle Eastern men. A barman there tipped off police that he had a customer who had admitted shooting two men and the officers arrived to detain the suspect. Olathe Police Chief Steve Menke declined to comment on the reports of racial abuse but said his force was working with the FBI \\"to investigate any and all aspects of this horrific crime\\". The killing dominated news bulletins in India and social media, where some blamed Donald Trump's presidency. Siddharth, an Indian actor who uses one name, tweeted to his 2.6 million followers: \\"Don't be shocked! Be angry! Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla.\\" Mr Madasani's father, Jaganmohan Reddy, also called it a hate crime, adding that such incidents had increased in number following Mr Trump's election. Mr Kuchibhotla was from the Indian city of Hyderabad. His parents, Madhusudhan Rao and Vardhini Rao, were too stunned by news of his death to comment, the Associated Press reported. The Indian external affairs ministry said two Indian consulate officials from Houston and Dallas have been sent to Kansas City to meet Mr Madasani and arrange the repatriation of Mr Kuchibhotla's body. The US Embassy in New Delhi decried the shooting. \\"The United States is a nation of immigrants and welcomes people from across the world to visit, work, study, and live,\\" said Charge d'Affaires MaryKay Carlson. \\"US authorities will investigate thoroughly and prosecute the case, though we recognise that justice is small consolation to families in grief.\\" Summary:","completion":"In a place called Olathe, there was a very sad event where a man named Adam Purinton hurt three people in a crowded bar using a gun. One of those people, named Srinivas Kuchibhotla, did not survive. Another person, Alok Madasani, got hurt too but is in the hospital getting better. A third person, Ian Grillot, tried to help stop the bad man and also got hurt. After this, Adam ran away but got caught later by the police. Some people think this bad action happened because of angry feelings about where the two first men were from and also think it might be connected to the president, Donald Trump."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The match is the term that refers to the entire playing time of tennis. A match is comprised of either the best of three sets, or the best of five sets (depending on your league). Each set is played best out of six games. One player serves per game. A game is generally won when a player (or team if you are playing doubles) wins four points. A point is started when one player serves, and the opponent hits it back and the point continues in a back and forth manner until one player hits it out or in the net. Keep in mind that a game might take seven points, or more, to end if, for instance, one player wins three points and another wins four. Each point is given its own value for each player: 1st point won is \\"15 points\\" 2nd point won is \\"30 points\\" 3rd point won is \\"40 points\\" 4th point won makes GAME (signifying the end of the game) During each game, it is the server’s job to call out the score so that the opponent can hear it (unless you are actually playing in a professional setting in which they have a score keeper). You are always supposed to say your score, followed by your opponent’s score. For example: If you have won two points and your opponent has won one, you would call out “30-15”. If your opponent has won three points and you have won one, you would call out “15-40”. Each set is played until one player or team (if you are playing doubles) has won six games. At the beginning of your serve, you must always call out the number of games each player or team has won, starting with your score. For example: If you have won four games, and your opponent has won two, you would call out “4-2” before beginning your “service game” (the game you serve the ball in, rather than receive). This refers to both games and sets. Here are some examples: If you both have a score of 40 to 40, then you have to win two points in a row in order to win the game. (See Step 3 below for more details). If you both have won 5 games, and the score is 5 to 5, then you will need to win two more games in a row to make it 7-5 in order to win the set. If it is 5 to 5 and you win the next game, the score becomes 6-5. If you lose the next game and the score is 6-6, you will need to win 8 to 6 in order to win the set. Some sets have had scores of 12 to 10 or even higher. Depending on the league you are playing in, you will either need to win three out of five sets, or two out of three sets. However, like with games and sets, you must win by two. That means that matches can sometimes be five out of seven sets, or even seven out of nine sets if you and your opponent keep tying. On a scorecard, you should write the score of each set down. You should always write your score first. For example, if you won the match, your scorecard might look like this: 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. That means that you won the first set 6 games to 3; you lost the second set 4 games to 6; and you won the third set 6 games to 2. Summary:","completion":"A tennis match consists of either the best of three or best of five sets, depending on the league, with each set comprising six games. A game is usually won by the player or team (in doubles) who scores four points first, using the scoring system of 15, 30, 40, and game. The server calls out the scores, and one must win by two points in case of a tie at 40-40. Each set is won by the player or team with six games, but again, the winner must have at least a two-game lead. In case of score ties such as 5-5, players need to win two consecutive games to secure a set. Matches can sometimes extend beyond the standard best-of if both players keep tying, requiring a two-set lead to declare the winner. Scores are recorded on a scorecard, with the player's score always written first, for example, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, indicating the player won the first, lost the second, and won the third set."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS (22 June 1887 - 14 February 1975) was a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund and the first President of the British Humanist Association. Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. As the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the USSR at the invitation of Intourist, where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank Political and Economic Planning. In the 1930s Huxley visited Kenya and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of national parks, which was happening in the few areas that remained uninhabited due to malaria. From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey's Africa Survey. In 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said \\"He was impatient... and lacked tact\\". He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right. In 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join World War II: a few weeks later came the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society--\\"a curious assemblage... of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic\\"--uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post \\"to save expenses\\". Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the Council's action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way. In 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The Commission's remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55.","completion":"This text is about Sir Julian Sorell Huxley, a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Why are the doctor at the hospital swapping heathy village children for university children? Because of the poor bloodlines and genetic mutations in the faculty's inbred offspring The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Innocence Swap In the idyllic rural settlement of St. Clair, children are known to embody an unparalleled vitality and health, attributed to their simplistic, nature-rich lifestyle. The tranquility of St. Clair stands in contrast to the frenzied urban life of Cardson University, where distinguished professors and faculty members reside with their progeny. The tragedy, however, lies in the defective genetic infrastructure of these offspring due to undisclosed generational inbreeding, leading to dire results. Dr. Adrianne Fields, an acclaimed geneticist and a Cardson University faculty member, stumbles upon this disheartening secret. Watching the children of her highly-respected peers suffer, Dr. Fields grows desperate. She devises a plan, shrouded in secrecy and ethical complexity, propelled by her firm belief that she's enhancing the lives of both sets of children. So begins the daring exchange of healthy children from the verdant village of St. Clair for these genetically compromised 'university children.' The plot intensifies as Dr. Fields and her team at the County General Hospital facilitate this illicit swap, creating an elaborate illusion of relocation programs and scholarships, covering the children's sudden adjacency switch without raising suspicions. She justifies her ethically questionable act by offering advanced education opportunities for the village children. However, a movie is incomplete without unexpected twists and hurdles. Jessica Ross, an investigative journalist and a native of St. Clair, starts noticing a pattern; her curiosity piqued by the sudden exodus of village children to the city's university and, more bizarrely, the influx of unfamiliar children with unique health conditions to St. Clair. She begins digging deeper, piecing together the dark puzzle Dr. Fields carefully designed to stay hidden. As Jessica edges closer to unravelling the truth, uncovering the tainted bloodline of the University's families, the film takes a thrilling turn. Exposed to an immense threat, Dr. Fields now races against time to ensure the plan's execution while evading detection. Parallely, we delve into the lives of the swapped children, resulting in an emotional rollercoaster, showcasing their struggles to adjust in unfamiliar environments, their longing for home, and their perspectives. And while St. Clair's children benefit from advanced education, their rich health, too, slowly starts to deteriorate due to the city life's strain. The climax builds up as Jessica entraps Dr. Fields into a corner, revealing her controversial actions to the world. A dramatic trial unfolds, questioning medical ethics, the right to a better life, and the extent to which genetic superiority overshadows basic human rights. As the verdict is announced, the movie leaves audiences questioning - Who was in the wrong? The doctor who wanted better lives for children or the system that failed to protect their innocence? In the final scenes, the children return to their original families, the village children bringing back new knowledge and perspectives, and the university children happier for having known a healthier way of life. Ultimately, \\"The Innocence Swap\\" is a cinematic exploration of ethics, responsibilities, society, and – most importantly – love that knows no genetics."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},E={key:1};function z(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
