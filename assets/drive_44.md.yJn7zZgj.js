The drama film The Journey is a fictional account of the true story of political enemies, Ian Paisley and which Irish republican? A:","completion":"The drama film \\"The Journey\\" is a fictional account of the true story of political enemies Ian Paisley, a loyalist and unionist politician from Northern Ireland, and Martin McGuinness, an Irish republican and the leader of Sinn Féin, who were central figures in the Northern Ireland peace process. The film, directed by Nick Hamm and written by Colin Bateman, focuses on the relationship between these two sworn enemies during the peace negotiations in the mid-2000s. Ian Paisley, played by Timothy Spall, was the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), while Martin McGuinness, portrayed by Colm Meaney, was the chief negotiator of the republican party Sinn Féin. Both men were pivotal in the negotiations, primarily because of their deep-rooted commitment and influence on their respective communities. The fact that they were willing to put aside their differences and work together toward a shared goal of peace made the achievement of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement possible, ending decades of violence and resulting in a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. \\"The Journey\\" imagines a scenario where the two leaders take a car journey together, allowing for an exploration of the growing understanding and goodwill between them. This ultimately paves the way for a partnership that changes the course of history in Northern Ireland. The film is a blend of fact and fiction, using the real story of these political enemies as a backdrop for a gripping and thoughtful character study. In summary, \\"The Journey\\" is a fictional account of the true story of political enemies Ian Paisley, a loyalist and unionist politician from Northern Ireland, and Martin McGuinness, an Irish republican leader of Sinn Féin. The film explores their evolving relationship in the context of the peace negotiations that ultimately led to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and their joint efforts in turning the tide toward peace in Northern Ireland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The Western Chalukya Empire (Kannada:ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯ ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ) ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries. Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control. During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuri, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the later half of the 12th century. The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II.

The dog was very happy, and ate the meat up at once. At noon, the dog came to the shop again. It gave the butcher a piece of paper again. After reading it, he gave it half a pound of meat once more. The next day, the dog came again exactly at noon. And as usual, it brought a piece of paper in the mouth.

By far, this 24 Hour Fitness stays the least crowded at all times (I almost feel guilty about revealing this online for fear that it will get more crowded) compared to almost every other one I've been to (the only exception is the one in Indio, CA). I have been to approximately ten different 24 Hour Fitness facilities over the past year. The free weights are available in abundance AND THE PEOPLE THERE PUT THEM BACK WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO!!! Simply amazing! They have two sets (4 each) of most of the dumbbells available in 5lb increments up to 150lbs (some clubs have them down to 2.5lb increments up to 52.5lbs). They have two towers of bar bells available in 5lb increments and the heavier weights are available with the EZ Curl bar. They have 3 flat bench press benches and (I believe) 1 decline and 2 incline benches. The dumb bells and bar bells are the new style Iron Grip rubber coated weights. Most of the equipment and facilities are new. There are plenty of treadmills, stair machines and they have the new Precor elliptical stride machines -- I don't know the exact names for them... I don't do any of the cardio classes, but it appears that there's always extra room in there. The same thing goes for the spin classes. I don't use the pool and I don't use the kiddie care facilities so I can't comment on those either. My biggest complaint is about the locker room. Many of the lockers look like they have been pried open at some point. The showers are pretty crappy, but at least they have partitions (no doors). Definitely not the worst showers I've used.

Two more hearts fall on the flop, so you have 9 outs. 9 x 4 = 36, giving you 36% chance to hit your flush and your opponent a 64% chance to hold up and win with a pair. 64/36 is a little less than 2 to 1. Therefore, it would make sense to call bets slightly higher than half the pot size. If another heart doesn't hit on the turn you are now 9 x 2 = 18% 18%/82% is a little worse than 5 to 1, meaning the bet has to be less than 20% of the pot. Summary:","completion":"The passage explains the concept of calculating the odds of catching one of your outs in a poker game, using the example of aiming for a flush with two hearts in hand. To calculate the percentage, you multiply the number of outs (9 in this case) by 4, resulting in a 36% chance to hit the flush and a 64% chance for your opponent to win with a pair. The ratio of 64/36 is approximately 2 to 1, guiding the decision to call bets slightly higher than half the pot size. If the desired card doesn't show up on the turn, the odds change to 9 x 2 = 18% for hitting the flush and 82% for the opponent's win.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The non-female role models on the protagonist, Scout, are primarily her father, Atticus Finch, and her older brother, Jem Finch.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Why did François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville contact Burke? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... answer the following question: What is the name of the person who drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer?

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions are not the same but are related. To clarify each concept, let's address them individually: 1. What is vegetation? Vegetation refers to the assemblage of plant species that grow and thrive in a specific geographic region or environment. It refers to all the plants and plant life forms that exist in a particular area, including trees, shrubs, grasses, and other flora. Vegetation serves various purposes both ecologically and environmentally, such as: - Providing habitat and food sources for animal species - Producing oxygen and sequestering carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining the earth's atmosphere and mitigating climate change - Stabilizing soil and preventing erosion by maintaining soil structure through their network of roots - Purifying water through processes like transpiration and evapotranspiration, which help to reduce pollutants in the environment - Providing raw materials for human consumption and economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, and landscaping Vegetation can be categorized into different types based on factors such as structure, species composition, climate, and ecosystems. Some examples of vegetation types include forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, and tundra. 2. What are vegetable cuttings? Vegetable cuttings refer to segments or parts of vegetable plants that are used for plant propagation. The process involves cutting a portion of a mature, healthy plant (such as a stem, leaf, or root) and encouraging it to take root and grow into a new, independent plant. This technique is commonly known as vegetative propagation or cloning. Vegetable cuttings can be an efficient and cost-effective way to produce new plants, particularly for species that are difficult to propagate through seeds. Some advantages of using vegetable cuttings for propagation include: - Achieving a faster growth rate compared to starting plants from seeds - Ensuring the new plants have the same genetic characteristics as the parent plant, which can help maintain a consistent quality and performance in agricultural production - Facilitating the production of plants that are hard to grow from seed, either due to low germination rates or complex germination requirements - Allowing for easier replication of plants with desirable traits, such as disease resistance, high yield, or specific flavors or colors In summary, vegetation refers to the plant life found within a specific area or ecosystem, while vegetable cuttings refer to plant segments used for vegetative propagation. The two questions are related in the sense that vegetative propagation is a method used for growing and managing vegetation, but they address different aspects of plant life."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Article: Many people consider their pets members of the family and are very sad when they die, but what if you could clone your dog, cat or bird?

Step 4: Preparing the meat Matthew explained the importance of properly preparing meat to avoid any foodborne illnesses. He taught Ian how to trim excess fat and handle raw meat safely, ensuring that it was cooked to the appropriate temperature. Step 5: Cooking the dish After all the ingredients were prepared, it was time for Ian to learn the different cooking techniques. Matthew demonstrated how to sauté vegetables, sear meat, and deglaze the pan. Ian attentively observed and practiced these techniques under Matthew's supervision. Step 6: Seasoning and tasting Matthew emphasized the importance of seasoning the dish and adjusting flavors as needed. He explained how to use herbs and spices to enhance the dish's overall taste, as well as how to balance saltiness, sweetness, and acidity. Ian was then encouraged to taste the dish and give his input on any adjustments needed. Step 7: Plating and serving Finally, Matthew showed Ian how to plate the dish attractively, stressing that presentation plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of a meal.

Information: - Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre formed in the United States in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing. - Def Jam Recordings is an American record label, focused predominantly on hip hop and urban music, owned by Universal Music Group.

If \\"A male tennis player jumps in the air as he prepares to return the ball.\\", does this mean that \\"The tennis player is about to win the point.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given information \\"A male tennis player jumps in the air as he prepares to return the ball\\", we cannot conclusively determine whether the tennis player is about to win the point or not. This scenario only provides a snapshot in time of a particular moment during a point in a tennis match without the necessary additional details to make a determination on the outcome of the point. In compelling detail, here's why the given scenario is inconclusive in determining if the tennis player is about to win the point: 1. Technique and skills: The male tennis player jumping in the air may have exceptional skills and technique that improve his chances of winning the point, but it is also possible that the opponent has an equally good skill set. Tennis matches are often unpredictable, and the players' techniques may vary during the game. 2. Trajectory and spin of the ball: The path and the spin of the incoming ball can also impact the likelihood of winning the point. If the ball is hit with a lot of spin or an awkward trajectory, the tennis player may be unable to return the ball effectively, or he may struggle to maintain control of his shot. 3. Court positioning: The tennis player's position on the court and his anticipation of the ball's trajectory may influence whether or not he returns the ball successfully. If the player is out of position or misjudges the ball's path, his chances of winning the point may decrease. 4. Opponent's preparedness: Another important factor to consider is the preparedness and reaction time of the opponent. Even if the tennis player returns the ball effectively, the opponent may be ready and able to counter with a strong shot, keeping the point in play. 5. Endurance and fatigue: The state of physical and mental endurance of both players can also play a pivotal role in determining who wins the point. It’s not unusual for professional tennis matches to last for hours, and energy levels can vary for each player. 6. External conditions: Weather conditions like wind and sun may impact both players' gameplay, making it harder to predict if the jumping tennis player is about to win the point. Playing surfaces, whether it be grass, clay, or hard courts, can also impact players' movement and ball response during rallies. Overall, the statement \\"A male tennis player jumps in the air as he prepares to return the ball\\" only provides a limited view of the situation without enough context to determine a direct link between the player's actions and the point's outcome. Factors like technique, court positioning, opponent's preparedness, ball trajectory, endurance, and environmental conditions all play a role in determining the winner of each point."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We can add 380*l to both sides: -68*l + 380*l + 1560 = -380*l + 380*l (Remember, -68*l + 380*l = 312*l) 5. Our new equation is: 312*l + 1560 = 0 6. Now, let's get l alone on one side of the equation. We need to get rid of 1560. To do this, we subtract 1560 from both sides: 312*l + 1560 - 1560 = 0 - 1560 312*l = -1560 7. Finally, we want to find out what l is. To do this, we divide both sides by 312: l = -1560 / 312 8. When we do the division, we find out that: l = -5 So, the solution to the problem is l = -5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What globular protein is used in the construction of the hollow tube? Choices: - actin - cyclin - keratin - tubulin A: The answer is:","completion":"- tubulin Based on the question asking about the globular protein used in the construction of the hollow tube, the correct answer is tubulin. Tubulin is a globular protein that assembles into microtubules, which are long, cylindrical, hollow structures. These microtubules play an essential role in various cellular activities such as cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape and structure. Now let's go through the other choices to understand why they are not the correct answer: - Actin: Actin is a protein that polymerizes to form actin filaments, also known as microfilaments. These filaments serve as the primary component of the cytoskeleton, contributing to cell motility, mechanical support, and the formation of cell extensions such as filopodia and lamellipodia. Although actin is involved in the structural organization of cells, it does not form hollow tubes, making it an incorrect choice. - Cyclin: Cyclin is a protein family that regulates the progression of a cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). They play a crucial role in the control of cell division. Unlike tubulin, cyclins are not involved in the construction of a hollow tube or in the formation of the cytoskeleton. - Keratin: Keratin is a family of fibrous structural proteins that form the primary constituent of hair, nails, horns, and other similar structures in animals. Keratins are intermediate filaments that provide structural support and mechanical strength to epithelial cells. Though keratins are an essential part of structural proteins, they do not form hollow tubes like tubulin. In conclusion, among the given choices, tubulin is the globular protein that is used in the construction of the hollow tube (microtubules), which serve various functions in cellular activities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Click OK.\\"","completion":"Title: Connecting to Wi-Fi: A Simple Guide for Little Ones Hey there, little buddies! Today, we're going to learn how to connect to Wi-Fi. You may be wondering, \\"What is Wi-Fi?\\" Well, Wi-Fi is a way for our computers, tablets, and phones to connect to the internet without using any wires. It's like magic! Before we start, you need to know that only grown-ups should handle setting up the Wi-Fi for you, but we still want you to understand how it works. So let's get started! 1. Click the Wi-Fi Icon. First, take a look at the bottom of your computer or tablet screen, where sometimes you can see little pictures or symbols. One of those pictures looks like a tiny radio tower with waves coming out of it. That's the Wi-Fi icon! When we click on this icon with our fingers or with the computer mouse, a whole new world opens up! It shows us a list of all the Wi-Fi networks we can connect to. Remember, it's always better to ask a grown-up to help you choose the right one. 2. Click your router's network name. Next, we have to find the network (or Wi-Fi signal) that comes from the special box called a router in your house. This box sends out the Wi-Fi magic so you can connect to the internet. Grown-ups use a special name for this box, called the \\"router's network name.\\" It's like how you have a name, and your friends have names, too. When you hear grown-ups talk about the router's network name, they might also call it an \\"SSID\\" – but don't worry about that big word, it's just another name for it! After you click on the Wi-Fi icon, you'll see a list of network names. Look for your router's network name and click on it. If you don't know the name, ask a grown-up to help you find it. 3. Enter the password. To connect to your Wi-Fi, we need a special word called a \\"password.\\" Passwords are secret words that only your family should know. Just like how superheroes have secret identities, these secret words protect your Wi-Fi from strangers. Ask a grown-up to tell you the password and then carefully type it into the box that opens up on the screen. Remember, passwords can be tricky – sometimes they have capital letters, numbers, or even funny symbols. Make sure you type it in just like your grown-up tells you to! 4. Click \\"OK.\\" Once you've typed in that secret password, you're almost ready to connect to the Wi-Fi magic! Look for a button that says \\"OK\\" or \\"Connect\\" and give it a click. After a few seconds, you should see that your computer, tablet, or phone is now connected to the Wi-Fi! Hurray! Go ahead and explore the internet with a grown-up's help, watch your favorite videos, or play some fun games. Now, you know how Wi-Fi works and how to connect your gadgets to it! As you grow older, you'll learn more about how these magical connections work. But for now, just enjoy the fun and remember to always ask a grown-up for help!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

He became an American citizen after emigrating from Europe. - An animator is an artist who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence. Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depends on the animators' artistic styles and their field. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\".

This stature is found nestling amid the countryside, and it stands as an edifice dedicated to the memory of Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia, an important figure in early English history. England, with its capital London, is renowned for its heritage and architectural wonders, and Dead Man's Plack stands as a unique element in its pantheon of historic monuments. London, a vibrant and dynamic city, is a blend of cultures, and its importance is not restricted to England alone but extends to global affairs. As the capital, it has been the epicenter of national and international events, with historical landmarks like the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, and the Palace of Westminster. It is also a buzzing city with modern structures like the Shard and the Gherkin. Amid these urban wonders, the existence of a historic monument like Dead Man's Plack elsewhere in the country is a reminder of England's profound history, which stretches beyond its capital city. The dedication of Dead Man's Plack to Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia, signifies the reverence the country has for its ancient rulers and their significant roles in shaping the nation's destiny. Æthelwald, considered a mighty power in early England, left indelible footprints in the country's history, and his memorial in the form of Dead Man's Plack, speaks volumes about the respect attached to this historical figure. The UK, including England, is a melting pot of cultures and languages, one of which is the ancient Cornish language. Though its use has dwindled over time, it still represents an essential fragment of England's diverse linguistic heritage. This language is a Celtic one, tracing back to the ancient Britons and surviving in isolated communities in Cornwall until the late 18th century. Its resurgence in recent years as part of cultural revival efforts adds another layer to England's rich societal fabric. Lastly, the Church of England plays a prominent role in the religious landscape of the country. As the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the oldest among the Anglican provinces, the Church of England has a significant influence on the country's religious, sociocultural, and political history. It represents a cornerstone of English spiritual life, encompassing various faith spectrums from high-church Anglo-Catholic to low-church evangelical. In essence, Dead Man's Plack, situated in the heart of England, symbolizes more than just a memory of Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia. It is emblematic of the rich tapestry of English history, interweaving tales of ancient ruler's mighty reign, linguistic diversity signified by the Cornish language, the spiritual fulcrum that is the Church of England, all under the overarching culture that converges in the vibrant metropolis of London, the capital city. Thus, England's rich contours of history, language, religion, and governance are etched deep into monuments like Dead Man's Plack, bringing successive generations closer to understanding their heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine.

Q: The unrest began when the start of voting was delayed because ballots and poll materials had not been delivered, and got worse after the discovery of stuffed ballot boxes, the UN official said. Some 15 polling stations were set alight, a parliamentary candidate told AFP on condition of anonymity. The town, in the central province of Kasai Oriental, is a stronghold for veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, chief rival to President Joseph Kabila in Monday's national polls. The UN source said Kananga residents had vandalised polling stations, blocked a truck from delivering election materials and thrown stones at a primary school where voting was due to take place after they found 190 ballot papers that had been hidden. ||||| KINSHASA Nov 28 (Reuters) - Masked gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons at a polling station in Lubumbashi, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's Katanga mining province, the governor of the province said as presidential elections took place on Monday. Separately, locals burnt down three polling stations in the neighbouring opposition heartland of West Kasai and an election observer was badly injured in crowd violence, Congolese electoral monitoring group RENOSEC said on Monday. ||||| Posted Monday, November 28th, 2011 at 7:15 am Voters in the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun casting ballots in presidential and legislative elections, after violence and accusations of fraud marred the run-up to Monday's vote. The head of the country's electoral commission said Sunday there was no evidence of fraud, after at least one opposition candidate said vote tampering was under way favoring incumbent President Joseph Kabila. At least three people were reported killed leading up to the election. Police in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi said gunmen attacked two election vehicles early Monday and set them on fire. This is only the second multi-party poll since the large central African nation was torn apart by two wars following independence. The last war ended in 2003. Mr. Kabila, who is running against 10 opposition candidates, is widely expected to win re-election. Results are expected by December 5, the day before Mr. Kabila's current term ends. President Kabila has been in power since 2001, when he assumed the presidency after the assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila. He won a presidential vote in 2006. His strongest challenger, long-time opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, backed down from plans to hold a rally Sunday in the capital, Kinshasa, in defiance of a ban on campaigning the day before the election. His advisers say they feared for his safety. On Saturday, Congolese police blocked Mr. Tshisekedi and his supporters from leaving the airport for several hours. They fired bullets and tear gas, killing three and wounding several more. The capital was reported calm on Sunday, described as a “Day of Reflection” in Congo, with no gatherings of large crowds. Mr. Tshisekedi has accused the head of the United Nation's large peacekeeping force in Congo of a bias against him. He has called for removal of mission chief Roger Meece, who once served as the U.S. ambassador in the county. More than 18,000 candidates are vying for 500 seats in the general assembly. ||||| AFP An armed attack and long delays have marred voting in the Democratic Republic of Congo's national elections after a campaign that saw deadly violence. Police in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi said armed men had swooped on a convoy of eight jeeps around 3am on Monday (Noon AEDT) and fled when police escorting the vehicles opened fire, wounding some of the assailants. Two jeeps carrying nearly 1000 ballots caught fire and burned in the attack. Advertisement: Story continues below The city, capital of the restive mining province of Katanga, had been a flashpoint of political violence in the run-up to the elections. Earlier this month, two days of street fights between opposition and government supporters shut down parts of the city, as shop windows were shattered and pedestrians mugged. On Sunday, gunmen attacked a military camp and arms depot in the city, killing one and fleeing after exchanging gunfire with soldiers. It was not clear if either that raid or Monday's election convoy attack had any link to the partisan clashes during the campaign. Violence also marred the run-up to the vote in the capital city of Kinshasa. The last day of campaigning on Saturday descended into chaos as police banned all rallies, using tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition to disperse opposition supporters. At least two people died in the unrest, although the exact circumstances were unclear. The campaign violence has drawn condemnation and calls for calm from the international community. Incumbent President Joseph Kabila, 40, in power since 2001, is running for a new five-year term in the polls against a field of 10 challengers. His main rival is veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, 78. The elections are only the second since back-to-back wars from 1996 to 2003, and the country remains one of the world's poorest, despite an abundance of cobalt, copper, diamonds and gold. Though polling stations opened on time at 6am in some areas, there were reports of undelivered ballots and long delays in others. Logistical headaches in organising the vote in a country two-thirds the size of western Europe - and whose roads network is crumbling and limited after seven years of war and decades of under-development - had raised fears the polls could be postponed. The election commission had to bring in 81 aircraft to deliver 64 million ballot papers to some 64,000 polling stations across the country, in a process plagued by delays. The run-up to the vote also saw allegations of fraud against the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), from opposition charges of \\"fictitious\\" polling stations to a leaked report by a consulting firm that said there were tens of thousands of ghost voters on the rolls. As voting opened in the capital, small groups of voters waited outside voting office 10189 at the Saint Georges school. The most senior official displayed the transparent ballot box, turning it upside down to prove it was empty at the start of the day. But, half an hour later, the lines of voters had not moved. Rita, a 40-year-old mother of five, complained about the delay. \\"The station hasn't even opened and it's 6.30,\\" she said, adding that she planned to vote \\"for change\\". \\"We need a president who loves this country. \\"Those who are in power reap the benefits for their own interests, and for the others, the people - zero.\\" \\"I'm fed up. I'm voting for change,\\" echoed 19-year-old economics student Jeremie. \\"Even buying breakfast is hard for us in the Congo, especially in Kinshasa.\\" ||||| A:","completion":"In Democratic Republic of Congo's national elections, unrest and violence occurred in multiple locations. Voting delays started due to undelivered ballots and poll materials, leading to the discovery of stuffed ballot boxes. In Kananga, a stronghold for opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, residents vandalized polling stations and blocked a truck from delivering election materials. In Lubumbashi, masked gunmen attacked a polling station, while locals burnt down three polling stations in West Kasai. Accusations of fraud emerged leading up to the vote, with opposition candidates alleging vote tampering in favor of incumbent President Joseph Kabila. The elections are the second since the country's back-to-back wars from 1996 to 2003, with incumbent President Kabila running against 10 opposition candidates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It implies that each individual is by themselves, meaning there are no groups of people and nobody is interacting with one another.

He couldn't afford most tickets so he booked something cheap. He arrived for his flight bracing himself for the worst. The flight was long, dirty and uncomfortable. Still in the end at least he managed to travel safely to his destinati. Can we draw the following conclusion? Tony was afraid of what could happen on the flight Choices: *Yes *It's impossible to say *No","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Tony was afraid of what could happen on the flight. This can be deduced from various elements mentioned in the story: 1. Tony's need to brace himself for the worst: The phrase \\"bracing himself for the worst\\" suggests that Tony was expecting something negative (or possibly even several negative incidents) to occur during the flight. This reveals a certain level of fear or anxiety regarding the conditions of the airplane or airlines he chose to fly with. 2. The cheap ticket: By emphasizing the fact that Tony booked a cheap ticket, the story is implying that the quality and the overall experience of the flight may not be up to par with more expensive options. A cheap flight could potentially result in the airline cutting corners in areas such as safety or services, which could heighten Tony's concerns about the overall experience and possible risks. 3. The long, dirty, and uncomfortable flight: It's stated that the actual conditions were subpar – the flight was long, dirty, and uncomfortable. It's likely that Tony had been aware of the possibility of experiencing a substandard flight, hence, he felt anxious about the potential of having to go through a displeasing journey. While it hasn't been explicitly stated that Tony was afraid of what could happen on the flight, the context and clues provided in the story indicate that he did have concerns or reservations about the flight.

Translate to German: How does one perceive and/or construct a specific public sphere and positional and/or participatory model for spectatorship as opposed to (modernist) generalized ones? German:","completion":"Wie nimmt man eine bestimmte Öffentlichkeit wahr und/oder konstruiert ein spezifisches Positionierungs- und/oder Partizipationsmodell für Zuschauerschaft im Gegensatz zu (modernistischen) verallgemeinerten Modellen? In dieser Frage geht es darum, wie man eine bestimmte Öffentlichkeit wahrnimmt und ein spezifisches Modell für die Zuschauerschaft entwickelt, das sich von allgemeineren, modernistischen Modellen unterscheidet. Um dies zu beantworten, können wir die verschiedenen Elemente der Frage betrachten und analysieren, wie sie in Bezug aufeinander stehen. Erstens bezieht sich \\"Öffentlichkeit\\" auf den Raum, in dem öffentliche Meinungen und Diskurse zirkulieren und in dem verschiedene gesellschaftliche Gruppen und Einzelpersonen interagieren und kommunizieren. Die Wahrnehmung und Konstruktion einer Öffentlichkeit hängen von verschiedenen Faktoren ab, darunter kulturelle, soziale und politische Aspekte. Ein spezifischer öffentlicher Raum könnte beispielsweise eine bestimmte Branche, eine Interessengruppe oder ein Thema betreffen, das für eine Gruppe von Menschen von besonderem Interesse ist. Zweitens beinhaltet ein \\"Positionierungs- und/oder Partizipationsmodell\\" die Art und Weise, wie Menschen sich innerhalb dieser Öffentlichkeit engagieren und ihre Rolle als Zuschauer wahrnehmen. Diese Modelle können je nach den Zielen, Werten und sozialen Dynamiken der verschiedenen Gruppen variieren. Ein Positionierungsmodell kann sich auf die Rolle von Individuen als passive Beobachter oder aktive Teilnehmer beziehen, während ein Partizipationsmodell stärker auf den Grad der Einbindung und Interaktion zwischen den Individuen und dem öffentlichen Diskurs abzielen. Der Gegensatz zu modernistischen generalisierten Modellen besteht darin, dass diese oft eine universelle Öffentlichkeit und eine allgemeine, homogene Zuschauerschaft annehmen, anstatt auf die Besonderheiten und Unterschiede verschiedener Gruppen und öffentlicher Räume einzugehen. Solche verallgemeinerten Modelle können dazu führen, dass bestimmte Menschen, Perspektiven und Diskurse übersehen oder marginalisiert werden. Um einen spezifischen öffentlichen Raum und ein entsprechendes Zuschauermodell wahrzunehmen und zu konstruieren, sollte man daher eine Reihe von Schritten unternehmen: 1. Identifizierung der spezifischen Öffentlichkeit oder Gruppe, die in diesem Raum teilnehmen wird, und ihre Bedürfnisse, Interessen und Werte. 2. Analyse der kulturellen, sozialen und politischen Kontexte, in denen diese Öffentlichkeit agiert, und wie diese die Dynamik des öffentlichen Diskurses und der Zuschauerschaft beeinflussen. 3. Entwicklung eines Positionierungs- und/oder Partizipationsmodells, das die verschiedenen Rollen und Möglichkeiten zur Teilnahme am öffentlichen Diskurs für die Mitglieder dieser Öffentlichkeit berücksichtigt. 4. Berücksichtigung der Vielfalt innerhalb der Öffentlichkeit und der Möglichkeit, unterschiedliche Perspektiven und Stimmen einzubeziehen, um ein inklusives und demokratisches Modell für den öffentlichen Diskurs zu fördern. Indem man diese Schritte befolgt, kann man eine spezifische Öffentlichkeit und ein Zuschauermodell wahrnehmen und konstruieren, das sich von verallgemeinerten modernistischen Modellen abhebt und sich besser an die Bedürfnisse und Ziele der beteiligten Gruppen anpasst."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose death and the ensuing succession crisis prompted Hulagu Khan to pull the bulk of the Mongol forces out of the Middle East? ? The Mongols were allied with the Song, but this alliance was broken when the Song recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Chang'an at the collapse of the Jin dynasty. The Mongol leader Möngke Khan led a campaign against the Song in 1259 but died on August 11 during the Siege of Diaoyu Castle in Chongqing. Möngke's death and the ensuing succession crisis prompted Hulagu Khan to pull the bulk of the Mongol forces out of the Middle East where they were poised to fight the Egyptian Mamluks (who defeated the remaining Mongols at Ain Jalut). Although Hulagu was allied with Kublai Khan, his forces were unable to help in the assault against the Song, due to Hulagu's war with the Golden Horde.Kublai continued the assault against the Song, gaining a temporary foothold on the southern banks of the Yangtze. Kublai made preparations to take Ezhou, but a pending civil war with his brother Ariq Böke—a rival claimant to the Mongol Khaganate—forced Kublai to move back north with the bulk of his forces. In Kublai's absence, the Song forces were ordered by Chancellor Jia Sidao to make an immediate assault and succeeded in pushing the Mongol forces back to the northern banks of the Yangtze. There were minor border skirmishes until 1265, when Kublai won a significant battle in Sichuan.From 1268 to 1273, Kublai blockaded the Yangtze River with his navy and besieged Xiangyang, the last obstacle in his way to invading the rich Yangtze River basin. Kublai officially declared the creation of the Yuan dynasty in 1271. In 1275, a Song force of 130,000 troops under Chancellor Jia Sidao was defeated by Kublai's newly appointed commander-in-chief, general Bayan. By 1276, most of the Song territory had been captured by Yuan forces, including the capital Lin'an.In the Battle of Yamen on the Pearl River Delta in 1279, the Yuan army, led by the general Zhang Hongfan, finally crushed the Song resistance.

A vase is the most suitable option among the ones provided, as it is specifically designed to hold and showcase flowers and other decorative plants. Vases come in various shapes, sizes, and materials, allowing for an easy match with the aesthetic of your table setting and the overall ambiance of your space. Using a vase doesn't only provide a structured and elegant way of displaying the flower, but it also helps keep the flower fresh and vibrant for a longer period. Vases are designed to hold water, which can prolong the life of cut flowers, ensuring that your table continues to look stunning throughout your event or daily life. Furthermore, placing a flower in a vase on the table allows it to become an integral part of the overall table setup. It can serve as a beautiful centerpiece, tying together other design elements in the space, and creating visual interest. A well-chosen vase with a striking flower can create a conversation starter, or build a desired atmosphere, ranging from sophisticated, romantic, or simply cozy and homely. While shelves, windowsills, parks, and gardens are all suitable places to display flowers in some contexts, they do not align with the specific context of displaying a flower on a table. A shelf or windowsill is generally not integrated with a tabletop setup; instead, they serve as displaying spaces for other parts of the room. A park or garden, on the other hand, are outdoor locations that encompass a larger area and do not provide a targeted context to display a single flower on a table. In conclusion, among the options provided, using a vase to display a flower on a table is the most suitable and effective choice, as it effortlessly merges functionality and aesthetics, while also delivering an impactful addition to your table setting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls.

Upton flew on a Zero Gravity Corporation flight to model new bikini and one-piece fashions in weightlessness for Sports Illustrated's 2014 Swimsuit Issue, which hit newsstands today (Feb. 18). Upton's weightless experience shows what it might be like to model while in outer space, according to ZERO-G officials. \\"The ZERO-G experience was really exhilarating for everyone involved,\\" MJ Day, editor of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, said in a statement. \\"We have been almost everywhere in the past 50 years with SI Swimsuit, but we have never done anything like this. It was certainly the most out-of-the-box shoot. Once again, Kate surprised us all with how she handled modeling in weightlessness.\\" [Fun in Zero Gravity: A Weightless Photo Gallery] In a video taken during the shoot on March 18, 2013, Upton can be seen floating through the air as photographers and the crew work to capture the model posing gracefully on the other side of the aircraft. The magazine unveiled the photos online and announced them via Twitter @SI_Swimsuit. \\"One small step for swimsuit, one giant leap for mankind,\\" someone adapting astronaut Neil Armstrong's famous words as he stepped on the surface of the moon for the first time, said at the end of the Sports Illustrated video. ZERO-G passengers experience weightlessness as pilots flying the company's modified Boeing 727 fly in parabolic arcs while thousands of feet above Earth's surface. As the plane tilts its nose and flies on the downslope of the parabola, passengers experience about 30 seconds of weightlessness at a time. For Upton's shoot, the company flew a series of 13 weightless parabolas and four parabolas imitating lunar gravity, according to ZERO-G. Upton floated through the plane in gold and white two-pieces and a gold lamé zip-up one piece. She also posed in droplets of weightless water while floating upside down in the plane for the magazine's 50th swimsuit issue. The weightless shoot was four years in the making, according to a passenger heard speaking in the Sports Illustrated video.

Upton isn't the only celebrity to fly in ZERO-G's unique brand of weightlessness. Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of commercial spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, took a ZERO-G flight with his family recently.

After a bit of gossip flies around the salon these wealthy women visit, Mary's friend and cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell) learns from a manicurist, Olga (Dennie Moore), that Mary's husband has been having an affair with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). A notorious gossip, Sylvia delights in sharing the news with Mary's other friends, and sets up Mary with an appointment with Olga so that she hears the same rumor about Stephen's infidelity. While Mary's mother, Mrs. Morehead (Lucile Watson), urges her to ignore the gossip concerning the affair and continue on as if nothing has happened, Mary begins to have her own suspicions about her husband's increasingly frequent claims that he needs to work late, and decides to travel to Bermuda with her mother to think about the situation and hope that the affair and the rumors surrounding it will fade. Upon her return from Bermuda a few weeks later, feeling well-rested and more sure of herself, Mary heads out to a fashion show at a high-end clothing store and learns that Crystal is in attendance, trying on clothes from the show in a dressing room across the hall. Sylvia joins Mary and baits her into storming into Crystal's dressing room and confronting her about the affair.

Christopher Clavius, the architect of the Gregorian calendar, noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year. Tycho Brahe also noticed discrepancies. The Gregorian leap year rule (97 leap years in 400 years) was put forward by Petrus Pitatus of Verona in 1560. He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the Alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (De revolutionibus) and Reinhold (Prutenic tables). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alphonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold). All values are the same to two places (14:33) and this is also the mean length of the Gregorian year. Thus Pitatus' solution would have commended itself to the astronomers.

That's what it means when 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not legal tender anymore - you can't use them to buy things. Now, when these big candies are not allowed, few things can happen: 1. If some kids were hiding lots of big candies to do naughty things or keeping it secret, they might be in trouble because they cannot use these candies now. 2. Good kids may need to go to their parents (like a bank) to exchange the big candies for smaller candies (new currency notes) to keep buying toys. 3. For some time, it might be hard to trade candies because everyone is trying to get rid of the big candies and get smaller candies. The next question is very similar to the first one.

They were very smart and knew a lot about stars, math, and calendars. But the interesting part is that the Mayans didn't just come up with their calendar all by themselves.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation due to more coal mining, resulting in more coal being burned, would be directly impacting a step of the process. To explain this in detail, let's take a closer look at the process and analyze how increased coal mining will potentially affect the steps involved. 1. Coal is burned: With more coal mining taking place, there will be an increased supply of coal. This will likely lead to more coal being burned in power plants and other industries that use coal as a source of energy. 2. Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides: As more coal is burned due to the increased supply, the amount of sulfur in the coal reacting with oxygen will also go up. This leads to higher levels of sulfur oxides being produced. 3. The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere: When more sulfur oxides are produced, more will be released into the atmosphere, contributing to the pollution of air. 4. The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide: With a higher concentration of sulfur oxides in the atmosphere, there will be an increased likelihood of them combining with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. 5. The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid: A larger amount of sulfur trioxide in the atmosphere will correspondingly cause more sulfuric acid to be formed when it reacts with water. This process contributes to the acidification of rain. 6. The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic: As more sulfuric acid is formed, its concentration in rain will increase, leading to more acidic rain. With more coal mining and the subsequent burning of coal, there is a direct impact on the first step of the process - burning more coal. This direct impact consequently affects all the other steps in the process, leading to a chain reaction that results in an increased amount of sulfur oxides and sulfuric acid being released into the environment. The ultimate outcome of the increased coal mining and burning will be a higher level of air pollution and a more acidic rain, which can have significant negative effects on human health, the environment, and infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Collins introduced himself to the modern Barnabas Collins family as a cousin from England , a hard-working businessman that had never been seen during the day . Collins introduced himself to the modern Barnabas Collins family as a cousin from England , a hard-working businessman never seen during the day .","completion":"Though the two sentences convey a similar overall meaning, they differ slightly in their sentence structure and emphasis. Let's analyze the differences: 1. Sentence 1: Collins introduced himself to the modern Barnabas Collins family as a cousin from England, a hard-working businessman that had never been seen during the day. 2. Sentence 2: Collins introduced himself to the modern Barnabas Collins family as a cousin from England, a hard-working businessman never seen during the day. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in the use of the relative pronoun \\"that\\" and the verb tense in the second part of the sentence. In the first sentence, the use of \\"that had never been seen during the day\\" provides a specific description of the businessman's daily activities using the past perfect tense (\\"had never been\\"). This past perfect tense implies a sense of continuity and establishes a time relationship, suggesting that Collins has consistently not been seen during daylight hours up until the time he introduces himself to the Barnabas Collins family. In the second sentence, the phrase \\"never seen during the day\\" omits the relative pronoun \\"that\\" and uses the present tense \\"seen.\\" This creates a more general statement about the businessman's activities, with slightly less emphasis on the consistent lack of daytime appearances. Both sentences ultimately convey the same core idea: Collins is introducing himself as a cousin from England and a hard-working businessman who is not seen during the day. However, the first sentence provides a more specific and continuous description of this unusual characteristic using the past perfect tense and the relative pronoun \\"that.\\" The second sentence presents a more concise and general description using the present tense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Eight different players from Hull FC scored tries, making this a rare and incredible performance. This not only points to Hull FC's deep and talented roster, but also shows their ability to adapt, strategize, and operate as a cohesive unit. As the match kicked off, the anticipation in the air was palpable. Both teams took to the field with vigor, but it was clear from the onset that Hull FC was keen on showcasing their prowess. The first try came quickly, setting the pace for what would be a game dominated by Hull FC's unrelenting tenacity. Fans roared as one player after another contributed to the scoreboard, with each try punctuating the dominance established early in the game. This outstanding victory can be attributed to several factors, chief among them being the team's incredible depth. Hull FC's ability to field a genuinely talented lineup allowed them to constantly cause trouble for Salford's defence, swiftly responding to every opportunity that presented itself. The fact that eight different players scored tries is a testament to both individual skill as well as strong teamwork — a lethal combination that proved too much for their opponents to handle. Another key aspect to this resounding win was Hull FC's adaptability. Throughout the game, they showcased an ability to quickly adjust to Salford's strategies and exploit any weaknesses they found. This adaptability, combined with the contagious confidence exuded by each player on the pitch, further cemented their position as formidable contenders in the Super League. While their offensive capabilities were clearly on display during the game, Hull FC's defence cannot be forgotten. Throughout the match, they expertly stifled Salford's attempts to create chances, neutralizing any potential threats and keeping their opponents firmly on the back foot. This strong defensive performance not only limited Salford's opportunities but also served to demoralize them as the match progressed. With such a dominant performance, it's no surprise that Hull FC's fanbase is exhilarated at the prospects for the rest of the season. The confidence and togetherness demonstrated by the team on the field is even more vital than the victory itself. Moving forward, fans and pundits alike will be eager to see if Hull FC can maintain their vigor, adaptability, and teamwork through the upcoming challenges of the Super League. In conclusion, Hull FC's convincing victory over Salford was a masterclass in teamwork and skill. The extraordinary achievement of having eight different players score tries underlines the depth and talent inherent in their roster, sending a clear message to the rest of the Super League that Hull FC is a force to be reckoned with. As the season unfolds, all eyes will be on this talented team to see if they can maintain their momentum and secure further victories in the intensely competitive world of the Super League."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \\"home signs\\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.

Write a text based on \\"u.s. calls on macedonia to form new government quickly\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Urgent Call to Macedonia: The United States Asks for Swift Government Formation The United States (U.S.) has recently called on Macedonia to form a new government promptly to ensure its continued progress and stability. This urgent request underlines the importance of establishing a stable and functional government as Macedonia faces various challenges, including its Euro-Atlantic integration aspirations, stabilization and reform efforts, and inter-ethnic tensions. Background on Macedonia's Political Situation: Macedonia, a landlocked Southeast European nation, is facing political uncertainty due to the delay in the formation of its new government. The protracted political deadlock began following the December 2016 general elections, when no political party was able to secure a majority in the 120-seat parliament. The election was held to resolve the country's long-standing political crisis that originated from a wiretapping scandal in 2015, implicating numerous government officials and leading to mass protests and instability. Need for Swift Government Formation: The prolonged political crisis in Macedonia has raised concerns about the country's ability to address pressing domestic and external challenges effectively. It is essential for Macedonia to form a new government urgently to: 1. Ensure Stability and Good Governance: Macedonia needs a stable, legitimate, and inclusive government to ensure good governance and promote democratic principles. The swift formation of a new government will ensure the implementation of necessary institutional reforms, which is crucial for Macedonia's democratic growth. 2. Advance Euro-Atlantic Integration: Macedonia's ambition to join the European Union (EU) and NATO will require strong and dedicated efforts from its government. By promptly establishing a legitimate government in place, Macedonia can re-ignite its integration process with both EU and NATO, which has suffered setbacks in recent years amid political turmoil and ongoing disputes with neighboring Greece. 3. Tackle Economic Challenges: A stable government is vital to address Macedonia's economic challenges, including high unemployment rates, slow GDP growth, and weakened investor confidence. A quick formation of the government will help implement necessary economic reforms, attract foreign investment, and support domestic businesses, thereby boosting the nation's economic growth. 4. Address Inter-Ethnic Tensions: Macedonia has been struggling with inter-ethnic tensions between its majority Macedonian population and the sizeable Albanian minority. With a stalled Ohrid Agreement implementation and increasing political polarization, it is crucial for a new government to forge cross-ethnic coalitions and re-commit to the agreement's principles that envisage minority rights protection, power-sharing, and decentralization. U.S. Support to Macedonia's New Government: The United States, as a long-standing partner and supporter of Macedonia, has a vested interest in facilitating the formation of the new government. It is vital for the U.S. to: 1. Offer Diplomatic Support: The U.S. should continue high-level diplomatic engagements with Macedonia's political leadership to facilitate dialogue and assist in government formation efforts. 2. Promote Democracy and Strengthen Institutions: The United States can help establish sound democratic practices and institutions in Macedonia by offering technical assistance, training, and capacity-building programs aimed at fostering an independent judiciary, supporting anti-corruption efforts, and promoting the freedom of speech and press. 3. Encourage Regional Cooperation: The U.S. could play a critical role in promoting regional cooperation and good neighborly relations in the Balkans. This can be achieved by encouraging constructive and inclusive dialogue between Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo, and other neighboring states, which would benefit regional stability and prosperity. Conclusion: The United States' call for a swift government formation in Macedonia highlights the pressing need for the country to navigate its political impasse and uphold democratic values. A stable and functional government will not only ensure Macedonia's progress but also strengthen its ambitions of Euro-Atlantic integration and home-grown socio-economic development. The support from the international community, notably the United States, will be crucial in Macedonia's path towards achieving sustainable stability and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Connective tissue is made up of many different types of cells that are all involved in supporting and binding other tissues of the body. Examples include tendon, cartilage, and bone. Blood is also classified as a specialized connective tissue. Connective tissues have several functions in the body, including providing structural support, connecting and anchoring different body parts, storing energy, and insulating and cushioning organs. These tissues are made up of cells, fibers, and an extracellular matrix, which consists of a non-cellular material that surrounds and supports the cells. The cells present in connective tissue vary due to their location and function. Some common types of cells found within connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes (fat cells), macrophages (immune system cells), and mast cells (immune system cells involved in allergic responses). The fibers present in connective tissues also vary depending on their function and location. Three primary types of fibers are found in connective tissue: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen fibers are strong and flexible, providing tensile strength to the tissue. Elastic fibers allow for stretch and flexibility, while reticular fibers form a delicate network, supporting soft tissue structures such as blood vessels and organs. The extracellular matrix of connective tissue is composed of a ground substance, a gel-like material that fills the space between the cells and fibers. The ground substance may be fluid, semi-fluid, or solid, depending on the specific type of connective tissue. It is made up of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and other various molecules that provide support and regulate cellular functions. In summary, connective tissue is responsible for supporting and binding other tissues of the body, with tendon, cartilage, and bone serving as prime examples. Blood is also considered a specialized connective tissue. The tissue's diverse nature comes from the variety of cells, fibers, and extracellular matrix components that make up its structure. By understanding these components and their roles, one can better appreciate the importance of connective tissue in maintaining the body’s overall structure and function."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

They dream big dreams and then show great courage to do things that others say cannot be done. Your dreams form the foundation of success. Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids. As they grow older, they are simply too caught up with their work activities that they fail to discover what they really want to pursue in life. To get you back on track to pursue your dreams, follow these steps: Learn to dream again; We are born to dream. But we hear of teachers calling in school: \\"Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!\\" Parents , too, have shouted, \\"Stop dreaming and go on with your homework!\\" In the end, many do get \\"realistic\\" and give up their dreams in time. Dream big dreams; Never set mental boundaries on what you are able to achieve. Dreams are free anyway so as long as you are dreaming, you might as well dream big. Many people cannot realize their dreams and achieve greater success because they limit their own beliefs. Flee from dream killers; Dream killers are destructive to your success. Your friends, colleagues and even loved ones can be one of your dream killers. There are people who will try to change, confuse or persuade you to build the life they want, not the life that you want.

Step 1: Combine like terms We can see that there are two terms containing the variable r, -268*r and 261*r. We can combine them to simplify the equation further. -268*r + 261*r = -7*r Now, the equation looks like this: -7*r + 49 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable r Now we want to get r by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we will move the constants to the other side of the equation to isolate r. -7*r + 49 = 0 To do this, we will subtract 49 from both sides of the equation: -7*r + 49 - 49 = 0 - 49 -7*r = -49 Step 3: Solve for r Finally, to find the value of r, we need to divide by the coefficient -7 on both sides of the equation: -7*r / -7 = -49 / -7 r = 7 So, the solution for the given equation -268*r + 261*r + 49 = 0 is r = 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the time, the Beijing Wushu Team had a scout in the United States and invited Yen over to Beijing, China, where he began training at the Beijing Sports Institute, the same facility where champion-turned-actor Jet Li trained; this is where the two of them crossed paths for the first time. Upon his return to the United States, Yen won gold medals in various wushu competitions. Yen later went on to discover and seek knowledge on other martial arts styles; he would later obtain black and purple belts from judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, respectively, and went on to study the art of Parkour, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Kickboxing and Boxing under various trainers. His exposure to mixed martial arts (MMA) was heightened when he went back to the United States from 2000 to 2003. While making his Hollywood debut, he also took time off to learn the various martial arts forms. Yen's progress was evident when he returned to Asia, where he implemented his newfound knowledge of MMA, showcased in films such as SPL: Sha Po Lang (2005), Flash Point (2007), and Special ID (2013). Near the end of 2007, Yen added a new martial arts system to his arsenal. He was offered the role of Wing Chun grandmaster and mentor of film star Bruce Lee, Ip Man, in a 2008 film named after the grandmaster. He worked hard and studied Wing Chun under Ip Man's eldest son, Ip Chun, for 9 months before tackling the role. Ip Chun has since praised Yen for his effort, his skills as a martial artist, and his ability to grasp the full concept of Wing Chun much faster than anyone else he has taught. Yen believes that combining many martial arts together will produce the most effective and harmonious style. Yen has said, \\"When you watch my films, you're feeling my heart.\\" He believes in practical combat, and in his opinion, MMA is the most authentic type of practical combat. He has mentioned that he would have competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship if he did not have a recurring shoulder injury.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Article: Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and \\"boring\\" side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s; many comedians, such as Eric Morecambe, made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film The Full Monty, in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's offside trap, in an attempt to co-ordinate their striptease routine. Another film reference to the club's defence comes in the film Plunkett & Macleane, in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal's long-serving full backs – the right-sided Lee Dixon and the left-sided Nigel Winterburn. Question: In what decades were Arsenal players stereotyped in a negative way?","completion":"Arsenal players were stereotyped in a negative way, mainly as defensive and \\"boring,\\" during the 1970s and 1980s. This stereotype was perpetuated not only by public perception but also through various forms of entertainment media, such as comedians like Eric Morecambe making jokes about the team's playing style, as well as film references in movies like The Full Monty (1997) and Plunkett & Macleane. During this period, Arsenal was known for its solid defensive tactics, with a focus on maintaining a strong backline and employing an offside trap. This style was effective in terms of winning matches, but it was not always pleasing to the eye for fans and neutrals alike, leading to the negative stereotype. The negative stereotype was further solidified in popular culture through various film references. The Full Monty depicted a scene where the lead actors mimic Arsenal's offside trap in an attempt to coordinate their striptease routine, emphasizing the team's focus on defense. Additionally, the film Plunkett & Macleane featured characters named Dixon and Winterburn, who were named after the club's long-serving full-backs, Lee Dixon (right-sided) and Nigel Winterburn (left-sided). These two players exemplified Arsenal's defensive mindset during those decades, making them fitting namesakes for characters in a movie that also referenced the club's defensive tactics. Although the stereotype persisted through those decades, it is important to note that Arsenal has undergone significant stylistic changes under different managers, and the club's playing style has evolved over time. However, the 1970s and 1980s remain the decades in which Arsenal players were predominantly stereotyped in a negative way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The wonderful world which lies before us today has been put up by hardworking men with clear heads and inventive mind, and these who follow them along life's road will improve on their efforts. It is sometimes necessary to question and even to disbelieve some of the statements made by experts. Action or experiment can often end an argument or achieve a breakthrough. When men were wondering whether it was possible to reach India by sailing westwards from Europe, and whether there was any land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Christopher Columbus decides to act. He gathered some men, invited them to go on board his three ships, and set out across the dangerous waters of the Atlantic Ocean. He was successful in finding land, but it was not India.

Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper... contains an answer for the question: What was the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" elected president of in March 1863?, what is it ?

When they play for a long time they have to stop because they do what? Options: A. feeling happy B. get hungry C. learning D. grow up E. injury Answer:","completion":"Option B. get hungry When Jimmy and Tim play together for a long time, they have to stop and take a break because they get hungry. As children engage in physical activities and expend energy, their bodies require nourishment to replenish nutrients and fuel their ongoing growth and development. Hunger is a natural response to sustained physical activity, as it signals that the body needs more energy to support the demands being placed on it. While the other options might have some associations with children and play, they do not provide a direct and reasonable reason for stopping play: Option A. feeling happy: Generally, feeling happy would encourage children to continue playing together rather than stop. Happiness strengthens relationships and promotes a positive environment for play and learning. Option C. learning: Playing together is indeed a form of learning, as children develop social, cognitive, and physical skills through interaction and collaboration. However, learning in itself would not typically be a reason for stopping play as it is an integral part of the play experience. Option D. grow up: Growing up is a gradual process that occurs over time and is not something that would cause children to immediately stop playing. While children's interests and preferences may change as they mature, this is not a reason for stopping play abruptly. Option E. injury: Although injuries can sometimes occur during play, they are not an expected outcome of playing together, and mentioning injuries as a general reason for taking a break from play unnecessarily puts a negative connotation on an otherwise positive and developmental activity. In conclusion, among the given options, it is common sense that Jimmy and Tim would need to stop playing when they get hungry, as hunger is a natural response to prolonged physical activity and energy expenditure. Taking breaks to eat and replenish their energy levels is important for the overall well-being and continued enjoyment of playtime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, find the side of the square.

The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Dom Martinus Dom, was a Belgian Trappist monk, and served as the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle, where he founded the Westmalle Brewery, in which country? Answer:","completion":"Dom Martinus Dom was indeed a Belgian Trappist monk who played a significant role in the establishment of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle and the Westmalle Brewery. Born in 1791, Dom Martinus Dom joined the Trappist Order in 1815 and, in 1836, became the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle, located in Belgium. Dom Martinus Dom's tenacity in preserving and expanding the monastery during his tenure as abbot played an integral part in shaping the abbey and the Westmalle Brewery's times. The Trappist Abbey of Westmalle, also known as the Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, was established in 1794 in Westmalle, a quiet Belgian village situated in the province of Antwerp. The monastery initially belonged to the Cistercians of the Strict Observance, also known as Trappist monks, who pursued lives centered on contemplation, manual labor, and self-sufficiency. To sustain their livelihood and support the monastery's upkeep, the monks turned to brewing beer, an activity deeply embedded in Belgian monastic history. Therefore, in 1836, under Dom Martinus Dom's leadership, the Westmalle Brewery was founded within the premises of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle. The brewery adopted the age-old monastic brewing techniques which laid the foundation for the exceptional quality and unique characteristics that Westmalle beers are known for today. It is also worth noting that Westmalle Brewery is one of the twelve breweries worldwide that produce authentic Trappist beer, certified as such by the Trappist logo. While the Westmalle Brewery started small, with monks initially only brewing beer for their consumption, it has since expanded and evolved over the years. Today, Westmalle Brewery distributes its beers across Belgium and has gained international acclaim for their renowned Trappist Westmalle tripel and dubbel brews. In summary, Dom Martinus Dom was a Belgian Trappist monk who served as the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle and was instrumental in the founding of the Westmalle Brewery. Both the abbey and the brewery are located in the village of Westmalle in the Belgian province of Antwerp. Westmalle Brewery is one of twelve officially recognized Trappist breweries, and it still operates today, producing the world-famous Westmalle Trappist beers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

Question: How did the Valide Sultan rule? Context: The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Michael McDonald (born February 12, 1952) is an American singer, songwriter, keyboardist and record producer. McDonald's music career spans more than 45 years. His early career included singing with Steely Dan. He joined the Doobie Brothers in 1976 and remained an integral member until 1982, after which he released the first of nine solo albums. After the Doobie Brothers' first farewell tour, McDonald released his first solo studio album, If That's What It Takes, in 1982 on the label Warner Bros. The album featured the hit singles \\"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)\\", a duet with his sisters Kathy and Maureen, and \\"I Gotta Try\\", a song co-written with Kenny Loggins, who also recorded in that same year for his fourth album High Adventure. He continued to collaborate with other artists during this period. McDonald co-wrote Van Halen's Top 20 hit \\"I'll Wait\\", from their biggest-selling album 1984. \\"Yah Mo B There\\", a duet with James Ingram, won the 27th Annual Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In 1985, he released his second studio album No Lookin' Back, which for the first time, he co-produced, as well as wrote or co-wrote all of the tracks and featured a minor hit with the title-track, co-written by Kenny Loggins. By June 1986, the album had met little success, but McDonald then had a huge boost with the release of the single \\"Sweet Freedom\\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines film Running Scared, and was McDonald's last Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The No Lookin' Back album was then re-released in some markets with the new hit single included, as well as a few songs remixed. The single \\"On My Own\\", a duet with Patti LaBelle, reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts in 1986. Later that year, he would perform as a backing vocalist on Toto's album Fahrenheit, appearing on the hit single \\"I'll Be Over You\\", as well its accompanying video. On August 22, 1986, McDonald appeared in an episode of The Young and the Restless. Also in 1987, McDonald did a featured collaboration with gospel quartet the Winans from their Decisions album titled \\"Love Has No Color\\". In 1990, McDonald released his third studio album, Take It to Heart, which featured a minor hit with the title-track, co-written by Diane Warren. The following year he joined the New York Rock and Soul Revue, put together by Steely Dan's lead vocalist Donald Fagen and featuring other artists such as Boz Scaggs and Phoebe Snow. In 1991, he released the single \\"Ever Changing Times\\", a duet with Aretha Franklin. In 1999, McDonald recorded the song \\"Eyes of a Child\\" for the South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, which is a comedic ballad written by Trey Parker. It was also used at the ending credits for the movie. The same year, he sang backing vocals on the Warren Brothers' single \\"Better Man\\", from their album Beautiful Day in the Cold Cruel World.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \\"the library lady\\" or just \\"the helper\\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. The answer is:","completion":"Question: In English hospitals, what can be said about the availability and quality of education for children? A) Every child in the hospital has access to a full-time teacher B) Most children have more than 2 hours of contact with a hospital teacher C) Special children's hospitals in major cities provide the best education, while general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are the worst off D) There are ample records of the content and quality of education provided in English hospitals Answer: C) Special children's hospitals in major cities provide the best education, while general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are the worst off Justification: In the article, it is stated that the extent and type of hospital teaching vary greatly across the country. The special children's hospitals in major cities have the best conditions, while general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. It is also mentioned that half the hospitals have no teacher, and a further quarter have a part-time teacher only. Additionally, proper records of the content and quality of education are not kept.

He was of African descent and Hollywood's first singing black cowboy. In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor, Exclusive, Coral, Decca, Bethlehem, Columbia, Mercury and Trend. His album Jamaica, recorded by RKO, is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs. From Detroit, at the urging of Louis Armstrong, Jeffries moved to Chicago where he performed in various clubs. One of his first gigs was in a club allegedly owned by Al Capone. Jeffries began his career working with Erskine Tate and his Vendome Orchestra. Tate signed the 19-year-old Jeffries to a contract with his Orchestra at the Savoy Ballroom in Chicago. His break came during the 1933 Chicago World's Fair A Century of Progress International Exposition singing with the Earl Hines Orchestra on Hines' national broadcasts live from the Grand Terrace Cafe. His first recordings were with Hines in 1934, including \\"Just to be in Carolina\\". By 1940, he was singing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and then recorded with him from 1940 to 1942. His 1940 recording of \\"Flamingo\\" with Ellington, released in 1941, sold more than 14 million copies in its day. His name had been Herbert Jeffrey, but the credits on the record mistakenly called him Jeffries, so he renamed himself to match the typo. \\"Flamingo\\" was later covered by a white singer, the popular vocalist Tony Martin. During his time with the Duke Ellington Orchestra as a lead vocalist, Jeffries proved his talent as a mature singer, demonstrating his wide vocal range in such songs as \\"I Don't Know What Kind of Blues I've Got,\\" \\"The Brownskin Gal,\\" and \\"Jump for Joy\\" (all 1941). The 1944 single \\"My Little Brown Book\\" by Ellington and his Famous Orchestra, on which Jeffries provided vocals, reached No. 4 on Billboard R&B chart. Later on, Jeffries was replaced in the Ellington's band by Al Hibbler. In his teens, Jeffries had developed a fine voice, initially singing in higher registers. He started out his singing career as a lyrical tenor, but, on the advice of Duke Ellington's longtime music arranger, Billy Strayhorn, he lowered his range to mimic the vocal stylings of crooner Bing Crosby. Jeffries became a \\"silken, lusty baritone,\\" according to music critic Jonny Whiteside. In 1945, Jeffries had a hit on the Billboard R&B chart with \\"Left A Good Deal In Mobile\\" (No. 2), on which he was accompanied by pianist Joe Liggins and his band Honeydrippers. Then, he moved to Europe and performed there for many years, including at nightclubs he owned. He was back in America by the 1950s, recording jazz records again, including 1957 collection of ballads, Say It Isn't So. In 1995, at age 81, he recorded The Bronze Buckaroo (Rides Again), a Nashville album of songs on the Warner Western label.

A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents. Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” What is Meade promoting to change the situation. Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. an initiative on the ballot to amend the state's constitution. B. not enough information C. a proposal on prison reform. D. a national debate.

Read this article and answer this question About eight million men surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war. All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front. Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered en masse. At the siege of Maubeuge about 40,000 French soldiers surrendered, at the battle of Galicia Russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 Austrian captives, at the Brusilov Offensive about 325,000 to 417,000 Germans and Austrians surrendered to Russians, and at the Battle of Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near Przasnysz 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, and at the First Battle of the Marne about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies. 25-31% of Russian losses were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4 million . From the Central Powers about 3.3 million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians. Germany held 2.5 million prisoners; Russia held 2.2-2.9 million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just before the Armistice. The United States held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down. Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory , thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15-20% of the prisoners in Russia died, and in Central Powers imprisonment 8% of Russians. In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.

What is the answer: Who invented the original 'little black dress'?","completion":"The original \\"little black dress\\" (LBD) is often attributed to the iconic French fashion designer Coco Chanel. Born Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel in 1883, she established her eponymous brand in the early 20th century and revolutionized the world of fashion with her modernist and simplistic approach to clothing. While the concept of black dresses has been around for centuries, Chanel's minimalist and versatile design led it to become known as the \\"little black dress.\\" Coco Chanel gained prominence in the early-1920s with her practical and comfortable creations that liberated women from constricting corsets and heavily structured garments. She was known for her use of practical yet stylish materials like jersey, a fabric primarily used for men's underwear at that time. Chanel's passion for fashion traces back to her humble beginnings as a seamstress and her stint as a milliner, where she created her custom-made hats. The little black dress made its debut in an issue of Vogue in 1926. Chanel's design was showcased as a simple yet elegant black, knee-length dress that could be easily dressed up or down with accessories, catering to various occasions. The dress was referred to as \\"Chanel's Ford,\\" implying it was like the Ford Model T, a car that was affordable, reliable, and accessible to the masses, revolutionizing transport. Similarly, Chanel transformed the little black dress into a staple that every woman needed in her wardrobe. Chanel's LBD was nothing like what had been seen before. At that time, black dresses were typically associated with mourning or reserved for religious and somber events. Her vision turned the concept around by proving that black could be elegant, timeless, and universally flattering, regardless of one's body shape or age. The dress became a symbol of modernism, sophistication, and liberated femininity. Throughout the years, the little black dress has been reinterpreted and revamped by numerous designers like Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Gianni Versace, and Hubert de Givenchy, among others. Givenchy's rendition of the LBD was famously worn by Audrey Hepburn in the movie \\"Breakfast at Tiffany’s,\\" making it an iconic symbol of 1960s fashion. Today, the little black dress remains an essential wardrobe staple in the world of fashion. Women across the globe still appreciate its versatility, practicality, and sophistication, making it a true testament to Coco Chanel's groundbreaking vision and design prowess."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\" - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence. - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power. - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility). - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

I was growing three sunflowers , but they were part of the group that I lost . Answer the following question: What kind of vehicle might they be driving","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the individual was likely driving a pickup truck. The reason for this conclusion is that they mentioned their flowers being in the \\"bed of my truck.\\" Pickup trucks are distinctive for their open, flatbed rear cargo area designed to transport large and bulky items. This makes them a common choice for those who need to carry plants, gardening supplies, or other large items on a regular basis. Considering the various makes and models of pickup trucks available, it is impossible to determine the exact type or brand of truck without further information. However, popular truck brands include Ford, Chevrolet, GMC, Ram, Toyota, and Nissan. A few of the best-selling models include the Ford F-Series, Chevrolet Silverado, Ram Pickup, and Toyota Tacoma. Trucks come in various sizes and configurations, such as light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty. Light-duty trucks are typically classified as half-ton trucks, while medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks fall into the three-quarter ton and the one-ton categories, respectively. Some pickup trucks have additional options and features such as extended or crew cab configurations, which provide more space for passengers, and different bed lengths for varying cargo needs. In this scenario, the individual likely selected a truck with a cargo bed size that could accommodate their collection of plants and flowers. In terms of fuel efficiency, pickup trucks tend to consume more fuel as compared to smaller, closed-bodied vehicles like sedans and hatchbacks. With that said, some newer models are being designed with improved fuel economy and reduced emissions in an effort to be both environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Hybrid options and electric trucks are also becoming increasingly popular in the market. In summary, although the specific make and model of the vehicle cannot be determined without additional context, it can be inferred that the individual was driving a pickup truck based on the description of transporting flowers in the truck bed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Monotheists hold that there is only one god, and may claim that the one true god is worshiped in different religions under different names. The view that all theists actually worship the same god, whether they know it or not, is especially emphasized in Hinduism and Sikhism. In Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity describes God as one God in three persons. The Trinity comprises God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. Islam's most fundamental concept is tawhid (meaning \\"oneness\\" or \\"uniqueness\\"). God is described in the Quran as: \\"Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\\" Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, and are not expected to visualize God. What do monotheists believe?","completion":"Monotheists believe in the existence of a single, supreme, and all-powerful deity. This belief is central to monotheistic religions, which maintain that there is only one true god who is responsible for the creation and governance of the universe. While the specific attributes and characteristics of this deity might vary across different faiths, monotheists generally agree on the fundamental concept of oneness and the rejection of any other gods. Within the context of various monotheistic religions, the concept of the one true god is represented differently: 1. Hinduism and Sikhism: These two religions, although not strictly monotheistic, promote the idea that all theists, regardless of their practiced religion, are in fact worshiping the same god under different names. This underscores the belief in the underlying unity and shared divinity among different religious traditions. 2. Christianity: In Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity supports monotheism by describing God as one divine being, consisting of three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. All three persons are considered as one God, sharing the same divine essence and working in unity. 3. Islam: The most fundamental concept in Islam is tawhid, which emphasizes the oneness and uniqueness of God. Islamic teachings stress that no other being or entity shares God's divine attributes or characteristics. The Quran asserts that God is eternal, absolute, and without any progeny or origin. The Christian doctrine of the Trinity, and the divinity of Jesus, are considered to be forms of polytheism in Islam. Muslim doctrine asserts that God is beyond all comprehension and is not comparable to any of his creations. Consequently, Muslims are not expected to create images or representations of God. In summary, monotheists believe in the existence of one supreme being who is the sole creator, sustainer, and ruler of the universe. The specifics of how this deity is perceived and worshiped may differ across various belief systems, but the central theme of monotheism is the belief in a singular omnipotent god."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's call \\"i\\" a box and we have to find what's inside that box. First, we're going to make the equation simpler. Let's move the boxes (i) to the same side. To do that, we'll add 12340 boxes on both sides of the equation. Here's how it looks: -12340 * i + 12340 * i + 925 = -12303 * i + 12340 * i Now, let's simplify it by combining the boxes: 37 * i + 925 = 0 Now, we'll move 925 to the other side. To do that, we need to subtract 925 from both sides. Here's how it looks: 37 * i = -925 Now, we just need to find out what's inside the box (i). To do that, we'll divide both sides by 37: i = -925 / 37 i = -25 So there we go, we found what's inside the box! The answer is i = -25. Great job, kiddo!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Russian, the phrase \\"this hotel is good enough for me\\" is translated to \\"Этот отель вполне подходит для меня.\\" The sentence has a positive meaning, indicating that the hotel meets the speaker's requirements and they are satisfied with it. In this translation: - \\"this hotel\\" - \\"этот отель\\" - \\"is good enough\\" - \\"вполне подходит\\" - \\"for me\\" - \\"для меня\\" The Russian language, belonging to the Slavic group of the Indo-European family of languages, uses the Cyrillic alphabet and has specific grammatical structures and rules. Like many languages, context and proper use of vocabulary play key roles in conveying the intended message. Russian also employs cases which impact the endings of words based on their grammatical function in the sentence. In the sentence \\"Этот отель вполне подходит для меня,\\" the subject \\"этот отель\\" (this hotel) is in the nominative case, which is used for the subject of the sentence. The verb \\"подходит\\" (suits, fits) is in the 3rd person singular form of the present tense, agreeing with the singular subject \\"отель\\" (hotel). The adverb \\"вполне\\" (quite, fully) serves to emphasize the suitability of the hotel. Finally, the prepositional phrase \\"для меня\\" (for me) clarifies for whom the hotel is suitable. When translating between languages, it's crucial to consider not only the literal meaning of words but also the cultural context and nuances of the source and target languages. This is particularly important when dealing with idiomatic expressions, proverbs, or slang that may not have direct equivalents in the target language.

B). positive.","completion":"B). Positive. The sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards the new version of 'Insomnia.' Words and phrases like 'surprisingly faithful remake,' 'fit it well,' and the note that it did not employ changes 'for the sake of commercial sensibilities' all impart a sense of appreciation and approval. The speaker appears satisfied with how the remake has retained essential elements of the original while also successfully incorporating its own unique twists. Firstly, the sentence mentions that the new 'Insomnia' is a 'surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor.' This implies that the speaker did not originally expect the remake to stay true to its predecessor. Therefore the realization that it did was a pleasant surprise, indicating a positive sentiment. Secondly, it states that when the remake does choose to deviate from the original, it does so with changes that 'fit it well.' This suggests the speaker approves of the creative decisions made in this context, further reinforcing the positive sentiment. Lastly, the speaker values that the changes were not made because of 'commercial sensibilities.' This statement infers that the speaker appreciates artistic authenticity over commercial influence.

Q: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay.

The","completion":"task here is to report the information and events that transpired in Syria on that day as accurately as possible, keeping in mind the details provided by the opposition activist group and the Arab League's response. Here is my step-by-step approach: 1. Understand the situation completely - Read and absorb the information provided about the events that transpired in Syria, like the number of people killed (64 in total), and the specific locations where they were killed (19 in Homs, 15 in Hama, 16 around Damascus). This information comes from a credible source, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC). 2. Contextualize the Arab League's role - Understand that the Arab League's presence in the region was meant to be a monitoring mission to protect Syrian civilians from government-sponsored violence. However, their response to this incident was to suspend their mission. 3. Emphasize the impact on civilians - Highlight the fact that the violence has affected innocent individuals, including the deaths of three children, as pointed out by the LCC. 4. Capture the human sentiment - Include LCC's call on Syrians to make Monday a day of remembrance by observing a moment of silence in memory of the fallen. Here is the final report based on the steps: At least 64 people, including three children, were killed in Syria on Sunday in various locations such as Homs, Hama, and around Damascus, as reported by the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC), an opposition activist group. In response to the escalating violence, the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission, which was initially deployed to protect Syrian civilians from government-sponsored violence. In a statement released by the LCC, the group called upon Syrians to make Monday a day of remembrance for the fallen heroes, urging them to observe a moment of silence to commemorate the sacrifices made by those who lost their lives. The LCC said, \\"Please join us in observing a moment of silence as we remember the sacrifices of our fallen heroes, whose pure blood has saturated the earth of our beloved country.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How do I determine if a chemical compound is patented? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"The answer is (1). No, the questions you asked have different meanings. The first question deals with the abbreviation \\"R-O-R\\", related to the field of organic chemistry, while the second question regards the determination of whether a particular chemical compound is protected by a patent, which is more related to the realm of intellectual property and patent law. To explain in more detail, \\"R-O-R\\" stands for a functional group known as an Ether in organic chemistry. Ethers are a class of organic compounds that contain an ether group — an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups of a general formula R-O-R'. The 'R' represents any alkyl or aryl group. Ethers are used as solvents and are common compounds in a lot of day-to-day pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Some common examples of ethers include Diethyl Ether (C2H5-O-C2H5) and Anisole (CH3-O-C6H5). To answer your second question: Patents on chemical compounds ensure exclusive rights to the inventors or legal assignees for a certain period, usually 20 years, from the date of filing; allowing them to prohibit others from manufacturing, using, selling or importing the compound in their countries where the patent has been granted. To determine whether a chemical compound is patented, you have to check with the patent databases. These databases are usually maintained by patent and trademark offices of different countries. Major patent databases can be accessed online and include the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the European Patent Office (EPO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and others. The patent databases contain detailed descriptions of respective inventions, which include chemical compounds, their preparation methods, usage, etc. A search can be conducted based on the name of the compound, inventors, or assignees, etc. Remember that just because a chemical compound is synthesized does not mean it's patented, as not all chemical compounds obtain patent protection. Also, a compound might be free to use in one country while it's still under patent protection in another, so the patent status often needs to be checked in every relevant jurisdiction. Therefore, as you can see, the questions you asked are related to different subject areas and hence, they do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is said there is no such thing as being over-prepared, and this is clearly a motto the Lithuanian government has taken to heart as it publishes a 98-page guide on how to survive an invasion. The small Baltic state has released the manual, entitled How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War, so its three million citizens will know exactly what to do should war come to their home soil. Its handy hints include keeping calm, using Facebook to organise resistance and - if all else fails - simply doing your job a little worse than you did before. The guide was compiled in reaction to OPTIONS: - Baltic's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Extreme Situations or Instances of War's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Facebook's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Lithuania's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Lithuanian's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Russia's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Twitter's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states - Ukraine's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states","completion":"The guide, entitled \\"How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War,\\" was compiled in reaction to Russia's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states. Over the past few years, the Russian Federation has engaged in acts of aggression towards its neighbors, particularly those in the Baltic region, causing an increased sense of alarm among these smaller nations. Lithuania, along with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia, has experienced numerous incidents of Russian incursion into their airspace and maritime territory, as well as cyberattacks on their critical infrastructure. These countries, being members of both the European Union and NATO, are particularly vulnerable to Russia's ambitions to reassert its dominance in the region and disrupt the balance of power. The 98-page guide, published by the Lithuanian government, addresses various aspects of potential invasion and subsequent occupation geared towards ensuring the safety and preparedness of its citizens. Some of the key recommendations contained within this document reflect both practical actions and psychological resilience strategies. Keeping calm: One of the fundamental messages within the guide is the importance of remaining calm under pressure, as panic and disorganization can potentially lead to disastrous consequences in a crisis situation. Using Facebook to organize resistance: In the event of an invasion, communication infrastructure may be compromised, rendering traditional methods of communication unreliable. The guide advises citizens to use social media platforms like Facebook to organize and coordinate resistance activities, share vital information with one another, and maintain connections with the rest of the world. Doing your job worse than before: As a potential last resort, the guide suggests that Lithuanian citizens could adopt a subtle form of resistance against an occupying force by deliberately performing their everyday tasks less efficiently than usual. This passive-aggressive strategy could potentially slow down or disrupt the operations of the occupying forces without necessarily inviting harsh reprisals. The publication of this survival guide underscores the degree to which Russia's actions, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its ongoing involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, have raised concerns among its Baltic neighbors regarding their own security. By preparing their citizens for the possibility of an invasion, the Lithuanian government is taking a proactive stance, reinforcing the importance of individual and collective responsibility in the face of a potential threat. In conclusion, Lithuania's decision to release a comprehensive guide on how to survive an invasion reflects the heightened sense of insecurity generated by Russia's aggressive behaviour towards its neighbouring states. The guide provides practical advice and psychological strategies that not only empower Lithuanian citizens with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect themselves against potential threats but also serves as a deterrent to any potential aggressors by showcasing a nation prepared to stand united for its sovereignty and freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. Question: How long has Temple Spa been a company?

MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay Â£500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon. Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay, evading Khan's bodyguard Gobinda's attempts to kill them both. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real FabergÃ© egg fitted with a listening device by Q, while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the FabergÃ© egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe.

Drug War Blocking Potential Treatments for Cancer, Alzheimer’s, Journal Claims Potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and many other illnesses are being blocked by anti-drug laws, according to a new editorial review published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience. Lead author David Nutt, chair of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, and his colleagues argue that tight restrictions on research on illegal drugs like marijuana and “legal highs” are hindering progress in neuroscience and deterring drug companies from pursuing important leads in major disorders affecting millions of patients. Nutt lost his job as the top advisor to the British government on drug policy in 2009 for publicizing data showing that ecstasy (MDMA) is less harmful than drinking or horseback riding. Comparing the harm to science to that done by the Catholic Church in banning the works of Gallileo and Copernicus, Nutt says, “People have not even realized how much research and how many possible new treatments have been blocked by drug laws.” Marijuana research, for example, is still extremely difficult to carry out — despite legalization of medical use by 17 states and recreational use by two. In the U.S., the drug can only be legally obtained for study from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and requires a special review and FDA-approved protocols that are not needed to study legal drugs or most experimental compounds. In the U.K., ironically, it is easier to study heroin than marijuana because heroin is a legal painkiller there. And yet the research that has been done on cannabis suggests significant promise— beyond relief of pain and nausea, where the benefits have already been clearly demonstrated. For one, several studies now suggest that marijuana might fight diabetes and obesity, two of today’s top public health threats. Secondly, other research suggests that cannabinoids— substances found in marijuana or synthetic versions of them— might potentially prevent Alzheimer’s disease, another leading cause of disability and death. Finally, there are dozens of studies showing activity of cannabinoids against various cancers. (MORE: How Cannabinoids May Slow Brain Aging) As a recent review of the cancer research put it: [Anti-cancer] activities have been demonstrated.. for various malignancies, including brain, breast, prostate, colorectal, skin, thyroid, uterine cervix, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, and lymphoid tumors. Says Nutt, “Inadvertent consequences of drug laws set up to stop people coming to harm failed to do that and inadvertently really screwed over research.” The illegality of recreational drugs in combination with the globalization of manufacturing and the internet has also led to the creation of a murky market in “legal highs.” Here, experimental compounds that seem likely to have pleasant effects are copied from pharmaceutical patent applications and research papers, then marketed without safety testing, even on animals. Governments then race to ban whatever gets media attention for becoming popular or doing harm, which sends illicit chemists back to the lab to make new “legal” products. The arms race means that many substances are banned with little or no study— and there are no published standards to determine what should be illegal. The effect is to hinder legitimate research, making many molecules as hard to study as marijuana. The expense and the hassle deter both academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers. “It increases the cost of my research by between 5 and 10 times,” says Nutt, who is one of the few who holds licenses to do such work in humans. He notes that the two co-authors on his paper are both retired and says that one colleague wanted to co-write it but didn’t for fear of losing future government funding. “Active researchers are terrified,” he says. As a journalist who has covered this area for decades, I’ve seen this problem occur repeatedly. Over the years, many researchers, who refused to be quoted publicly, have privately expressed to me their frustration with the barriers on research and one told me explicitly that he dropped a promising line of work on a major disease because of them. The review notes numerous examples of the laws’ interference with medicine. For one, virtually all psychedelic research was shut down after LSD became popular in the 1960’s, despite data suggesting it was promising for the treatment of alcoholism and useful in therapy. Now, new data from the few small studies that can get funded suggest that psilocybin mushrooms may help treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and MDMA may fight post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson’s disease. (MORE: LSD May Help Treat Alcoholism) Another example is the story of methoxetamine, a compound similar to ketamine. Ketamine is legally used for anesthesia and is now showing promise as a rapid-acting antidepressant. But it is also misused recreationally, typically in nightclubs. Long term recreational use— and possibly long term therapeutic use— can cause bladder damage, sometimes severe enough to require the removal of the organ. Methoxetamine, however, seems to have the positive effects of ketamine, without the bladder risk. But because it has been used as a “legal high” and substitute for ketamine, the British government banned it this year, along with similar compounds that might also have therapeutic benefit. “That means there won’t be much research on safer alternatives to ketamine,” says Nutt, “People will stick to ketamine and run the risk of bladder [problems]. What’s worse, some of the compounds, which have been banned were never tested in humans or never even made. This is again like locking away science so people will never explore the full potential of these compounds.” (MORE: ‘Magic Mushrooms’ Like ‘An Anti-Inflammatory for the Ego’) Right now, there are no clear answers as to how to solve the regulatory dilemma. Three United Nations treaties limit how countries can change their own laws in relation to currently illegal drugs; and although public opinion is changing on marijuana, federal law in relation to its medicinal uses has been remarkably resistant to change. The UN will meet to review its drug policies in 2016 and that’s where Nutt would like to see revisions. “We’ve got to have evidence-based drug classifications and policies,” he says. The problem varies by drug. Marijuana, for example, has not been categorized by the U.N. as entirely without medical use, while MDMA and psilocybin were declared medically useless. This means that America could unilaterally decide to make medical marijuana legal, putting it in a category with drugs like morphine, that are restricted but are not as difficult to study— but changing the status of other drugs would require international cooperation. And as the “legal high” market grows and chemists become ever more clever, the current system of regulation is being overwhelmed. We all want to prevent addiction and the negative consequences associated with the use of some drugs — but, as this review demonstrates, it is becoming increasingly clear that the main type of experimentation that our drug laws prevent is legitimate scientific research. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about how some rules and laws are stopping scientists from researching new medicines.

Movie plot title: The Arrival Movie plot: Zane Zaminski (Charlie Sheen), a radio astronomer working for SETI, discovers an extraterrestrial radio signal from Wolf 336, a star 14 light years from Earth. Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but Phil dismisses the claims. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki.Zane relocates the signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to Mexico and finds the radio station was burnt to the ground. Searching the local area, he comes across a new power plant. There, he helps climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built, that appears to be the cause of this increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment. Surprisingly, Zane realizes one of the guards could pass as the identical twin of his former boss, Phil, except that he is of Mexican ethnicity (whereas Phil is not). As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates a miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment. Zane leaves Ilana to again investigate the power plant and she is soon killed by a scorpion planted in her room.Zane discovers the plant is a front for an underground alien base.

Yale president Ezra Stiles recounted in his diary that while he moved furniture in anticipation of battle, he still couldn't quite believe the revolution had begun.

In the study, researchers looked at about 1,900 schoolchildren. The scientists found that the kids who had been instructed to spend more time outdoors over three years were 23 percent less likely to develop nearsightedness during this time than those who had not been instructed to spend more time outdoors. Moreover, among the kids who did become nearsighted during the study, the degree to which their eyesight worsened was slightly smaller among those who spent more time outdoors. The researchers selected six schools and required the children, whose average age was 7 at the start of the study, to attend one additional 60-minute class of outdoor activities during each school day for three years. The parents of these children were also encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school, especially during weekends and holidays. The other half of the children, from another six schools, continued their usual activity patterns. Afterthree years, 30.4 percent of the kids in the intervention group had become nearsighted, compared with 38.5 percent of the kids in the other group. It is not clear exactly why spending more time outside would benefit children's eyesight, the researchers said. However, some research has suggested that the higher levels of light intensity found outdoors may increase the release of the chemical dopamine of the eye. In turn, dopamine is known to restrain the type of growth in the eye that is associated with nearsightedness. Based on the new results, the researchers recommend that children spend more time outdoors because of the potential benefits to their eyesight. However, it's important to protect kids' skin and eyes from UV light, which can be damaging. Which can serve as the best title for the passage?

After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \\"marines\\" (most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits). The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms.

More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the six astronomers and take them to the palace of their king.

Dumbo, Brooklyn - How Noir Looks When Itâs Polished - NYTimes.com So much for that effort (detailed on DumboNYC.com). Over the last 15 years, residential development has swept from west to east through this tiny Brooklyn loft district anchored by the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, an enclave of about 25 blocks that once manufactured everything from boxes to Brillo pads. Now the noirish late-19th- and early 20th-century warehouses originally populated by several dozen artists have been joined by waterfront condominiums and rental buildings that are home to almost 3,000 residents â and the pace of development has not slowed. Even a decade ago, Dumbo was not a place for the faint of heart. Ted Moncreiff, a resident, said he remembered having to protect his son, a toddler at the time, from treacherous conditions along Front Street. âThere used to be these deep wells along the sides of the buildings,â he said. âAnd honestly, it was like Baby Jessica in the well â if anybody fell in, there was no getting you out.â These holes have since been covered and the rough edges smoothed. The area, no longer rugged, has become almost quaint, with old train tracks in uneven Belgian-block streets. And whatever one thinks of its name, Dumbo has become one of the toniest parts of Brooklyn. âItâs a much more physically pulled-together and beautiful place to live,â Mr. Moncreiff said. âIt also feels more â âsuburbanâ isnât the right word â but thereâs only so many strollers before you are no longer officially an urban pioneer.â Itâs also much pricier. Records show that in 2003, Mr. Moncreiff paid 850,000 for a two-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath condo at 30 Main Street, and that in 2011, he sold it for almost 1.6 million. The unit is now listed at 1.825 million. Mr. Moncreiff lives at 192 Water Street, and declined to reveal the purchase price there. Residents say few artists live here now, but the area continues to attract a creative, if more entrepreneurial, class. And a concentration of Internet and technology firms has led the city to designate the area as one leg of a Brooklyn âTech Triangle.â That creative energy lends vibrancy to a neighborhood that now has enough of its own amenities to rival neighboring Brooklyn Heights. Dumbo is smaller and has the feel of a village, where people get to know one another, residents say. âDumbo happens to be a very sticky neighborhood, insofar as people stay here,â said Jared Della Valle, who has lived in the area for over a decade. âPeople move from building to building; they upgrade their apartments each time; and their kids stay in the same schools.â The area has long been a magnet for film crews and fashion photographers, attracted by its bridges, views and postindustrial landscape. But residents say Dumbo has also become a tourist destination. âWhich is wild,â said Deborah Brener Zolan, a resident and an agent with Brown Harris Stevens, âbecause itâs not a big neighborhood at all, and to see a tourist bus come through is pretty remarkable.â There is little quibbling about boundaries for Dumbo, which is typically seen as the roughly 25 blocks circumscribed by the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Bridge Street. It was more than three decades ago that David C. Walentas, the founder of the Two Trees Management Company and a major figure in the residential remaking of Dumbo, bought a hefty chunk of the neighborhood for 12 million. He began the first condo conversions of manufacturing buildings, starting with the Clock Tower building at 1 Main Street, in the late 1990s. Most recently, Two Trees has converted some of the areaâs older buildings, 25 and 30 Washington Street, into rentals, and is laying the foundation for a 17-story rental tower, called the Dock Street project, said Jed Walentas, Davidâs son, who handles daily operations. The area west of the Manhattan Bridge, known as âprime Dumboâ among real estate mavens, is mostly developed; residents say that the grittier area east of the bridge is undergoing development. Recent projects of note have included the rental building 220 Water Street and smaller condo buildings like 185 Plymouth and 192 Water. The area has even attracted behemoths like Toll Brothers, which has developed condos at 205 Water. Inventory is very tight: only about 17 to 20 homes are on the market, at some of the highest prices in Brooklyn, said Terrence Le Ray, a Dumbo specialist with Halstead Property. Since apartments here are typically spacious conversions, theyâre often compared in prices per square foot, he said. For a standard condominium, the range per square foot is 950 to 1,000, but over all, units can cost as little as 850 a square foot, or as much as 1,400, Ms. Brener Zolan said. âThe 1,200- and 1,400-a-square-foot apartments are going to be in the buildings on the water with the views and the 13-foot ceilings,â she said. A view of Manhattanâs landmarks and the two bridges may run a buyer an additional 100 per square foot, Mr. Le Ray said. Also, because units with more than two bedrooms are rare, they typically get a premium, he said. Dumbo has more rentals than ever before. According to Ms. Brener Zolan, one-bedrooms range from about 3,000 to 3,200 a month, though units with home offices can rent for as much as 5,000. Two-bedrooms generally command 4,500 to 6,500 a month; three-bedrooms cost 7,000 and up. The relatively recent development of Brooklyn Bridge Park, particularly the Main Street and Empire-Fulton Ferry sections, which are in Dumbo, has added an attraction to the neighborhood. The park has lots of activities, one of them the popular Smorgasbord, a food market offered by the Brooklyn Flea in the parkâs Tobacco Warehouse on summer Sundays. Dumbo has art galleries and boutiques, restaurants and cafes. A new restaurant serving American cuisine â Atrium, at 15 Main Street â has so far been a hit. Supermarkets are small and pricey, consisting of Foragers at 56 Adams Street and Peas & Pickles at 55 Washington. (The nearest large alternatives are Trader Joeâs, in the Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill area, and Fairway in Red Hook.) The F train has a stop on the edge of Dumbo at York Street, while the A, C, 2 and 3 lines require about a 10-minute walk. The commute via subway into Midtown takes 20 to 25 minutes, but many people also cycle (there are Citi Bike racks throughout Dumbo) or take the East River Ferry or the New York Water Taxi. Dumbo proper has no public schools, though it is zoned for Public School 8 Robert Fulton in Brooklyn Heights, which is popular with many Dumbo parents and also houses a middle school. It got a B on its most recent progress report; 80.1 percent of tested students showed mastery in English, 82.7 in math, versus 47 and 60 citywide. Two popular private schools in Brooklyn Heights are the Packer Collegiate Institute and St. Annâs School, which both run through Grade 12. Teens from Dumbo typically attend public high schools all over the city. It will be at least two years before Dumbo acquires its first public school: a 300-seat middle school, scheduled to open either in 2015 or 2016 as part of the Dock Street project. The area that eventually became Dumbo often used to be referred to as Two Bridges, defined as it is by the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. In 2007, the Landmarks Preservation Commission included almost the entire neighborhood in what it designated the Dumbo Historic District.

Please answer a question about the following article about Financial crisis of 2007%E2%80%9308: Moreover, a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, in order to maintain their assets under management. This choice was supported by a \\"plausible deniability\\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \\"vintages\\" of subprime loans was so low.

Movie title: The Mummy Context: In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep has a love affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return. In 1926, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from an American adventurer, Rick O'Connell, who encountered the city while in the French Foreign Legion. Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison. Rick leads Evelyn and her party to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Despite Ardeth's warning of the city's evil, the two expeditions continue to excavate.

Write an article with the title: \\"Supreme Court strikes down overall limits on political contributions\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Supreme Court Strikes Down Overall Limits on Political Contributions Introduction: In a landmark decision that has reshaped the landscape of campaign finance in the United States, the Supreme Court has struck down overall limits on political contributions by individuals. The ruling, which has drawn praise from free speech advocates and criticism from those concerned about the influence of money in politics, eliminates caps on the total amount individuals can donate to candidates, parties, and political action committees (PACs) during an election cycle. Step 1: Explaining the background of the case The case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (FEC), originated when Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, along with the Republican National Committee (RNC), challenged the constitutionality of overall contribution limits under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). These limits were put in place to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption in political campaigns. Step 2: Detailing the court's decision In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the overall limits on political contributions infringed upon the First Amendment rights of individuals to support their preferred candidates and causes. The majority opinion, penned by Chief Justice John Roberts, stated that the restrictions did not serve a compelling government interest and were not the least restrictive means of combating corruption. Step 3: Explaining the implications of the ruling The Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon v. FEC has far-reaching implications on campaign finance in the United States. By eliminating overall contribution limits, the decision opens the door for wealthy individuals to donate significant sums of money to a wider array of political actors during any given election cycle. Critics argue that this will increase the influence of big-money donors and decrease the political power of ordinary citizens. Step 4: Exploring opposing viewpoints Supporters of the decision argue that it upholds the First Amendment rights of individuals who wish to support multiple candidates, parties, or PACs financially. By striking down overall contribution limits, they contend that the Supreme Court has acknowledged the importance of free speech and the right of citizens to participate in the political process without undue restrictions. However, opponents of the ruling assert that it exacerbates income inequality and allows wealthy donors to wield even greater influence over political decisions. Critics worry that the removal of overall contribution limits will only serve to erode public trust in the democratic process, as politicians may become more beholden to their financial backers than their constituents. Step 5: Conclusion The Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon v. FEC is a significant development in the debate over campaign finance and how much money should be allowed to shape American politics. While some view the decision as a victory for free speech and the rights of individuals, others see it as a step backward that will only magnify the influence of big money in the political system. As the country continues to grapple with the consequences of this ruling, it remains to be seen what future campaign finance reforms may arise to address the concerns of both sides in this contentious debate."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Write an article with the title: \\"BBQ talk: Difference between grilling and barbecue\\"","completion":"Title: BBQ Talk: Difference between Grilling and Barbecue Introduction As the warm, sunny days approach, amateur and professional chefs alike are excited about firing up their grills and smokers for that quintessential summer gathering with family and friends. While most of us love a good barbecue or grilling session, few realize that these two methods of cooking are not the same but are often confused. In this article, we’ll delve into the key differences between barbecue and grilling, exploring the unique flavors and techniques that each method offers. What is Grilling? Grilling is a high-heat cooking method that involves quickly searing food over direct flames. Commonly associated with backyard cookouts and picnics, grilling involves using a gas or charcoal grill to achieve the desired smoky flavor and tantalizing grill marks on your favorite meat, fish, or vegetables. Key characteristics of grilling: 1. High heat: Grilling typically involves temperatures of 350 to 500°F (175 to 260°C), allowing the food to cook faster than with other methods. 2. Short cooking time: Given the high heat, grilling typically leads to short total cook times, ranging from a few minutes for small or thinly sliced items to approximately 10-20 minutes for larger or bone-in cuts of meat, poultry, or fish. 3. Direct heat: The food is placed directly atop the grates, exposing it to high heat and flames from either gas burners or burning charcoal, ensuring even cooking and excellent sear marks. 4. Less smoke: Grilling produces less smoke than barbecue, resulting in a more subtle smoky flavor. What is Barbecue? Barbecue, on the other hand, is a low-and-slow cooking process that uses indirect heat and smoke to impart deep, savory flavors into food, typically enjoyed in an outdoor setting. The term \\"barbecue\\" is also commonly used to refer to the gathering or event centered around this type of cooking. Barbecue is a culinary staple in the Southern United States, with regional variations in sauce and technique making it a cherished and debated tradition. Key characteristics of barbecue: 1. Low heat: Barbecue is a slow-cooking process that uses lower temperatures, typically ranging from 200 to 300°F (93 to 150°C), allowing the food to gradually absorb the flavors. 2. Long cooking time: Since the heat is lower, it takes much longer to cook, ranging from a few hours for smaller cuts of meat to an entire day for larger ones. 3. Indirect heat: In barbecue, food is never placed directly on the heat source. Instead, it is cooked indirectly, often on a separate rack or chamber, to avoid scorching and provide even heat distribution. 4. Smoky flavor: By using wood chips, chunks, or logs, barbecue imparts the unmistakable, complex, and aromatic flavors that separate it from other cooking methods. Comparing Grilling and Barbecue Now that we’ve established the key characteristics of grilling and barbecue, here’s a head-to-head comparison: 1. Type of food: Grilling is ideal for steaks, burgers, sausages, boneless chicken breasts, fish, and vegetables. Barbecue, on the other hand, is best suited for larger, tougher cuts like briskets, ribs, pork shoulder, and whole poultry. 2. Equipment: Grills, whether gas or charcoal, are designed for the high-heat method of grilling, whereas smokers and specialized barbecue pits are built to handle low-and-slow smoking. 3. Fuel: Propane or charcoal are common choices for grilling, while hardwood or briquettes are preferred for barbecue due to their slow-burning nature and flavor-enhancing properties. 4. Seasonings: Since grilling involves quick, high-heat cooking, marinades and rubs are commonly utilized to add flavor. Barbecue relies primarily on the low-and-slow smoking process and often incorporates a regional sauce, mop, or dry rub to enhance taste. In Conclusion Although there are some similarities, grilling and barbecue are different cooking techniques with unique flavor profiles and methods. Learning the nuances between these two styles can enrich your culinary repertoire and make your outdoor gatherings even more enjoyable. So, the next time you invite your loved ones for a \\"BBQ,\\" consider whether you're preparing a zesty, charred steak fresh off the grill or tender, smoky ribs that have been cooking low-and-slow.

Step-by-step justification: 1. Plants start growing on or near the rocks: This is the initial stage where plants begin to grow close to the rocks, often in small cracks or crevices. 2. The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock: As the plants grow, their roots extend further into the rock, exerting pressure on it. This pressure leads to the rock starting to break up. 3. The plant acids dissolve the rock: Certain plants release organic acids that can chemically dissolve minerals in the rock. This process further weakens the structure of the rock. 4. The rock is broken down into smaller pieces: With the combined forces of root pressure and chemical dissolution from plant acids, the rock breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments. This is the final step of the process, as the rock is now more susceptible to erosion and transport by natural forces like wind and water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand. Question: After receiving help from Juliette Murray, most students probably: === The answer to the above question is Possible answers: 1). Are much more likely to have a serious medical injury 2). Are much more likely to become doctors 3). Are much less likely to become doctors 4). not enough information Answer:","completion":"2). Are much more likely to become doctors The answer is based on the information provided, which states that Juliette Murray noticed a shortfall in the number of students applying to study medicine and attributed this to the lack of realistic work experience opportunities available to them. To address this issue, she created a program that offered students a more genuine insight into the world of medical professionals, including hands-on experience in live operation theaters. By offering a more accurate representation of the responsibilities, pressures, and rewards of being a doctor, surgeon, or other medical professionals, Juliette Murray's initiative could potentially inspire a greater number of students to pursue a career in medicine. As a result, it stands to reason that students who participate in such a program are more likely to become doctors than those who do not. The other answer options seem less probable because: 1) There is no correlation between medical injuries and students receiving help from Murray's program. 3) As the program is designed to encourage more students to follow a career in medicine, it is unlikely to have the opposite effect. 4) Although more information might be useful in reaching a more certain conclusion, the details provided appear sufficient to suggest that students participating in Murray's work experience initiative are more likely to become doctors."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who befriends the spoiled son of an American business tycoon on the boat? from the following article ?

U.S. Markets - washingtonpost.com Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein was online Wednesday, March 7 at Noon ET to discuss his column about the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market, and will field questions about the recent ups and downs on Wall Street. Read today's column: Policymakers' Approach to Risk: 'What, Me Worry?'. About Pearlstein: Steven Pearlstein writes about business and the economy for The Washington Post. His journalism career includes editing roles at The Post and Inc. magazine. He was founding publisher and editor of The Boston Observer, a monthly journal of liberal opinion. He got his start in journalism reporting for two New Hampshire newspapers -- the Concord Monitor and the Foster's Daily Democrat. Pearlstein has also worked as a television news reporter and a congressional staffer. His column archive is online here. Bowie, Md.: There's an article in the Wall Street Journal today about increased forclosures outside the sub-prime, market, too, among borrowers who actually have good credit but are in bad products: Mortgage Defaults Start to Spread A responsible lender won't make loans to people who can't pay them. How much of the problem is lenders, who should have known better, gave loans to people who can't be expected to? Steven Pearlstein: Indeed, we haven't seen the end of this string, which is just beginning to play out. The article points ou that the default raTE HAS DOUBLE DIN THE CATEGORY OF MORTGAGES BETWEEN SUBPRIME AND PRIME. And we have yet to hear from prime borrowers who, as you point out, also went in for these exotic mortgages that let [people not pay some month if they find it inconvenient, or reset after two years, or have little money down. If the problem in subprime causes house prices to fall further, this will begin to wash back to prime mortgages that have little equity and/or that reset at much higher interest rates. Anyone who argues that we've seen the bottom in terms of the housing busrft, and its impact on the financial sector and the reeal economy -- these folks are blowing smoke. And for Fed officials to embrace this line, as they seem to be doing these days, is downright irresponsible. Germantown, Md.: I am concerned that changes in the mortgage market could cause a free-fall in home prices in the D.C. area. The majority of local mortgages made in the last few years were ARMs and option-ARMs. I understand that soon lenders must qualify purchasers based on the final, not teaser interest rate of an ARM. In theory, if borrowers must qualify at rates that are about 3 times higher than before, housing prices would have to drop by 67 percent to maintain the same affordability as today, which is already low. Add to that (1) a general trend of rising interest rates, (2) more conservative underwriting practices generally, and (3)fewer subprime lenders and products, and it seems local values are bound to drop through the floor. And worse, actions by regulators and legislators are accelerating us toward a crisis, not averting it. Please tell me I'm completely wrong. Steven Pearlstein: Now, I wouldn't go overboard on the collapse of house prices. That's probably taking it a step to far. But there is nothing to say they can't decline 25 percent from their highs in some submarkets, given the huge increases of the precvious five years. Washington still has some strong job growth, which will cushion things for us. But out in autoland, like Ohio and Michigan, where people are losing their jobs and the economy is probably already in recession, you could have more serious default problems. I think most people, especially the Federal Reserve, recognize the risks you mention in your article. However, I think you far overestimate the Fed's jurisdiction in these matters. Or at least your article seems to suggest that you do. With regards to derivatives markets, not only are many of these instruments lightly regulated, if they are regulated at all (excepting financial accounting standards that determine how institutions value them), the size of the market is largely unknown. And what would you have the Fed do about this? The Fed's primary functions are to ensure a sound infrastructure for the banking system; even risky business practices of banks are matters for other agencies, such as the FDIC and OCC. Second, the monetary policy mandate specifically points to the real side of the economy--jobs and income. Financial markets and the long list of things that can affect consumers income because of wealth effects, but nowhere is the Fed charged with babysitting Wall Street. I don't know where this idea that the Fed existed to keep Wall Street on track comes from. I guess Greenspan certainly did not discourage it. In many of the matters you cite, Fed officials can at most offer opinions, not take any direct action. Why don't you call out the chief financial regulators in this country, like the heads of the SEC, FDIC, and OCC if if you are worried about underlying instability in financial markets, especially the obvious \\"wild west\\" culture in complicated derivatives instruments. Nobody even knows who these people are. It is naive to think that the Fed's tweaking of the Federal funds rate really matters that much. And I think it is a good idea for the media to wean the public--and maybe Congress will catch on--that the Fed is all-knowing and all-powerful. Steven Pearlstein: This has nothing to do with the federal funds rate. It has to do with the Fed'as role as prudential regulator of bank holding companies, including most of the large Wall St. banks and investment houses that are the originators of much of this credit -- in the subprime market, in the takeover market, in commercial real estate, in commodity sdpeculation. In short, everywhere that we have seen bubbles (everyone, that, is, except the Fed, which believes you can only see bubbles ex post). And in this role as prudential regulator, the Fed is proving itself once again to be a day late and a dollar short. Here's my irrefutable piece of evidence: loans of tens of billions of dollars for highly leveraged buyouts like Equity Office with few, if any, conditions that would allow the loans to be pulled, or price increaseed, if certain rosy scenarioso n which the loan was made do not materialize. Any regulator, in this environment, who doesn't step in and say this is a problem isn't doing his job. And I don't care what the bank's risk mabnagement system says about it. Prudential regulation is not simply about making sure the bank has enough of its own capital to cover its losses. Its about reigning in a very competitive market so that this kin dof risky lending doesn't become the norm, causing systemic risk that would requres the Fed to step in and arrange a \\"private sector\\" workout or bailout. Thweir faith in the self-correcting powers of markets is misplaced -- its there, but it often takes a long time to show up. That's why we have regulation -- something Mr. Warsh et all seem to forget. Falls Church, Va.: Good column today, but it's worth noting that the biggest financial meltdown in recent history, and the one that cost the taxpayers most dearly, was the savings-and-loan crisis -- a failure of over-regulation, not under-. It's easy to demonize securitization and derivatives, since they seem so arcane and dehumanized. But overall they do allow a more accurate pricing of risk and better hedging against market volatility. Individual investors who over-indulge (Orange County, LTCM) get burned, but those failures disappear without a ripple in the larger economy. It may not be a coincidence that these instruments haven't faced \\"a deep recession or global market meltdown;\\" they may be working to make such events less likely. It's hard to care that Citigroup may be overextended, because it puts itself in this position every ten years or so. And home builders go bankrupt on a cyclical basis. The sky isn't falling. Steven Pearlstein: That's right -- the sky isn't falling. But the sun ain't shining, either. On the S&L crisis, it was indeed a failure of prudential regulation, as those risky loans were piling up on the books of the savings institutions, nothing was done. Then, the mistaske was conmpounded by forcing all those insitutions into receivership at one time, causing the assets to be dumped on the market and driving down pricves to the point that it brought down otheer institutions. Which, to my mind, speaks to the need to intervene early when the pattern of risky lending begins to assert itself -- because if the regulators get there after the fire is already roaring, there are really only bad options left. Laurel, Md.: When I took out my ARM three years ago, its fully indexed rate was only 3.75 percent because short term rates were only 1.25 percent. Today it would be 7.50 percent, and if I were near lock expiration I'd re-fi tomorrow at about 6% fixed. Are the sub-prime forclosees people who thought 4 percent indexed rates could continue forever; people who weren't expecting such a severely inverted interest rate curve (7.5 percent fully-indexed short vs. 6 percent long-term fixed available); or, um, people with little knowledge of economics who were put into a complex mechanism they didn't understand. If the latter, that's why government exists. As a related question, has there ever been a time when ARMs were a good option for homeowners who expected to hold them long-term into their fully indexed period; or were they always for those who intended to flip, move, or re-fi before the end of the rate lock? Steven Pearlstein: No, there have been times when interest rates were at hisorically high levels that made it a good time to do an ARM. But doing an ARM in a low interwest rate environment, for most homeowners without much income cushion, is silly. The savings of a quareter or a half of a point isn't worth the risk. If you can't afford the 15 year fixed in that environment, you probably can't afford the house. Noraville, Australia: How badly will top-of-the-food-chain entities like Goldmann Sachs, J.P.Morgan, etc. fare when the over-leveraged bloated arbitrages of the subprime market explode from the overindulgent and rampant feasting that's been going on since the tech-bubble burst? Steven Pearlstein: I would only note that the implied rating from the swaps market in the bonds of some of these insitutions are somewhere around junk. These derivativers markets have a tendency to overshoot, soyou shouldn't eread too much into that. But it also means that somebody out there is worried about the quality of credit behind the credit. Danvers, Mass.: Job number one for the Fed: insure the balance sheets of the big boys against catastrophe (even if it's their own doing)the justification being to prevent a wider system problem. Job number two: to justify and create a reserve army of the unemployed to preserve the income statements of the big boys by keeping labor costs sufficiently low. (Labor globalization is making this pretty easy.) So, Steve, how bad does the subprime problem and follow-on consequences have to be before the Fed starts to pay out on its insurance, boosting liquidity, reducing rates? Steven Pearlstein: Pretty bsad, actually. John, I wouldn't think this a good time for any major central bank to reduce rates absent evidence of a dramatic economic slowdown. Markets are still too frothy, with too many participants believing that the world has changed and many of these assets prices are justifiable. Chicago, Ill.: How important are financial models to the problems created by subprime mortgages? I was struck by a paragraph in Warren Buffett's annual letter that didn't get any press coverage. In discussing his need for a younger person to take over the investing for Berkshire, Buffett wrote: \\"We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks, including those never before encountered. Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions.\\" The February 20 New York Times had a very interesting article on the substantial limitations of models used for scientific issues. It seems equally applicable to financial models. Steven Pearlstein: Boy, you can say that again. This faith in the models is tautological nonsense. The people who do the models to direct hedcge fund trading strategies are the same very smart people who devise the risk managemernt models at the banks. So it should be no surprise that when something happens that was never forseen by the one set of models, it will also challenge the assumptions underlying the other. There simply isn't enough experience with stress since many of these new instruments and trading strategies became prevalent foer thr models to be relied upon the way they are. We need more old-fashioned common sense added into the regulatory and risk management mix. Arlington, Va.: Do you think Alan Greenspan realized, a little too late, that he needs to be just as careful about what he says now that he's no longer Head of the Fed as when he was? Steven Pearlstein: His comments were surprising, and I suspect they have the folks over at the Fed a bit annoyed. But look -- it had to come sometime that his views would differ from that of his predecessor. Now that it has, it probably won't be taken as such a big deal in the future. So its probably just as well we all got over this hump. Having said that, the difference between the Fed forecast and Greenspans is that Greenspan was always more intuitive that the modelers. And this is precisely the time when intuition trumps models, because by their nature, models cannot predict market or economic turns. Manassas, Va.: I enjoyed your column \\"Time for Northern Virginia to Take Road Less Traveled\\" in that it brought up many \\"economics of transportation\\" issues that need to be addressed much more thoroughly than we can ever hope. However, the weakest part of your column was brushing over the issue of using education funds for transportation. I wish you would expand on the whole economics of that clash. It was a bit offensive to dismiss well-meaning people wanting to preserve funding for education as part of the \\"old interest-group hustle by parent and teacher groups . . .\\" That is just blaming the victims. If they don't see things exactly as you do, maybe it is due to a lack of education. Yes, transportation raises money for education, but education also raises money for transportation. Educated people earn more salary and pay more payroll taxes. Could you address the cost/benefit analyses of state funded education more thoroughly in future columns? washingtonpost.com: Time for Northern Virginia to Take Road Less Traveled (By Steven Pearlstein, March 2, 2006) Steven Pearlstein: Your comment assumes as if this money is the private property of the education estalishment. Look, spending on education has recently gone up substantially. It will continue to do so, All that is being proposed is that, for one year, a portion of the anticipated growth isd used for another vital public service -- one that will allow the NoVa economy to continue growing and producing those annual increases in tax revenue. That is just smart, long-run fiscal policy -- and foer the education establishment not to see it only reveals a terrible short-sightedness on their part. Rockville, Md.: Mr. Pearlstein: isn't the Fed's utter indifference to the systemic risks posed by the exploding hedge fund industry --- an industry that is utterly opaque and almost entirely unregulated -- a stunning contrast to its obsession with Freddie and Fannie -- two local, monoline companies that live in a political and regulatory fishbowl? Steven Pearlstein: Yes. The Fed would argue that, because of the implied guarantee of Fannie and Freddie's debt, they require closwer supervision. I agree. But to say that regulators should have zero visibility into highly leveraged intermediaries like hedge funds and private equity firms is also unwise. Salt Lake City, Utah: I am a wholesale A/E for conforming and Alt-A. My question relates to the Alt-A products. What I have seen is the high LTV Stated income seconds (100 percent) go away. Why is this being affected? Are these prodcuts considered Sub-prime? Additionally I have a comment. With the sucess of Fannie Mae's, \\"My Community\\" and FHA's loan program, which are basically a sub-prime loan that is insured, why doesn't the market follow their sucess? This has never made sense to me. Steven Pearlstein: Not sure I understand the lingo. Sorry. Rockville, Md.: Better underwriting standards can't cause a free-fall in home prices-- only the evaporation of liquidity can do that. That's why Congress created Freddie and Fannie to serve the middle class, conventional mortgage market back in 1970: when there was a liquidity crunch severely affecting middle class homeownership. Because of their GSE status, Fannie and Freddie have the ability to keep mortgage markets liquid when liquidity gets hard to come by in the general capital markets. Steven Pearlstein: Precisely. And you can be sure that once the banks decide that mortgages aren't ther things to hold, they'll all sell them off quicker than you can say Resolution Trust Corp. The idea that these guys are careful, deliberate and wise in their investment decisions is laughable. They behave like a herd on the way up and the way down. College Park, Md.: Shouldn't any credit-worthy person be able re-finance today at about 6 percent fixed? Are the forclosees people who can't handle even that? Did mortagers really lend to people who needed 4 percent as their permanent rate? Steven Pearlstein: I'm afraid they did. Pretty neat, huh? Annapolis, Md.: Has America, culturally, over-rated homeownership? American Dream, and all that? Other than lifelong singles who live in cities, just about everyone who can afford it WANTS to own; and we encourage it through government-subsidized fixed rate mortgages and interest deductions because home ownership builds stable communities. Is renting a better option that it's given credit for; and not a sign of failure? Steven Pearlstein: Yes, I think thwere is a cultural bias, as well as a tax bias toward home ownership that is overdone. Boston, Mass.: I don't understand all this worry about the subprime lending market. The subprime lending market is a good thing. Everyone that is able to get subprime loans now were simply shut out of the credit market altogether in years past. They have worse credit, perhaps debt, perhaps lower income, but there is an interest rate that reflects that risk and thats what they pay. When we talk about record defaults rates please please note the actual rate, and recognize for the 1 person defaulting there are a few struggling and dozens living happily in homes that they wouldn't have had access to. Steven Pearlstein: You know, the problem in subprime isn't that people with basd credit hisotirs got loans. Its that they got loans structures in a way that pose big risks down the road -- not because the people have bad credit histories, but because they really didn't have the income and assets to justify a loan of that size. You don't do anyone a favor making them an owner of a home they can't afford. Alexandria, Va.: What causes an inverted yield curve? Steven Pearlstein: In this case, too many investors and central banks wanting to buy Treasuries at a time when the Fed is trying to use overnight rates to control inflation. Do you see any parallels developing between the present mortgage default rate trends and what happened in the late 1980's early 1990's when the economy slipped into recession, banks and S and L's became under capitalized, credit tightened, and home values fell hard resulting in a massive rise in foreclosures. I don't yet sense that those doomsday forces are in play today. The economy seems strong, employment is relatively low and banks liquidity positions seem strong. People who remain employed and don't have to sell can continue to make payments even if their home price is less than their outstanding mortgage amount. Maybe this is just a minor blip from people who took on a more risky loans than they should have? Steven Pearlstein: Yes, there are some scary parallels. Let's hope regulatorde have learned the lessons from previous mistakes. Pasedena, Md.: How localized is this? Is it mainly a problem in the urbanized areas where the housing price bubble created pressure for illusionary low-rate mortgages; or is the low-cost heartland in trouble, too? Steven Pearlstein: Biggest problems now are in Aeriz and Florida, bubble territory, but also the heartland where manufacturing problems have impacted the job market. Rockville, Md. The great part of today's column is that it lays bare the underlying politcal-economic forces driving Bernanke's shoddy analysis. The Fed loves the hedge funds and the big banks m aking money on these subprime ARMs but the products \\"work\\" only because the profits come out of subprime borrowers hard-won home equity. When macro conditions (falling home prices, end of borrowers' ability to use remaining home equity to refi into another bad loan) prevent that from happening, end of free ride. Your point: that's where Freddie and Fannie need to come in and use their government sponsorship to engineer a transfer of those borrowers who can be saved into a transparent, affordable fixed-rate product that entails no further equity-stripping. I think that's your point? Am I mistaken? Steven Pearlstein: Not exactly, but its a provocative analysis. Atlanta, Ga.: There are plenty of people who can't afford higher payments - there are tons of people who have refi'd and owe 125 percent or more on their home. (answer to above question). I'm happy we owe 25 percent or less of what we could sell our home for (that would be a bad market). It's still a large mortgage, but doable. And, I think I saw something about owning vs. renting re: NYC where so many just rent without thinking - one of the drawbacks is that after 20, 30 or more years, most renters have not built up equity, and while their peers have, and can do what they want (includes retirement) they just don't have the savings. This was cited as a negative for the rent control that NYC has (that is a horrible practice, for so many other reasons as well.). No matter what the cost of the house, at the end (if you're responsible) you own it. So even if rent is LESS, over time, you are forced to save. Steven Pearlstein: Yes, the forced saving aspect of a house is a good thing. Of course it weorks only if house prices rise over time, which certainly has been the case. Not sure, hoever, that the next 40 years will have the same appreciation as the last 40. Steven Pearlstein: That's it for today, folks. Got to go out and shovel snow!

Charlie Ward Jr. (born October 12, 1970) is a retired American professional NBA basketball player, college football Heisman Trophy winner, Davey O'Brien Award winner and a Major League Baseball draftee. Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft. He won the College Football National Championship Game with the Florida State University Seminoles. Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals. Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award as a quarterback for Florida State University, and subsequently led the Seminoles to their first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl. The Seminoles had suffered their only defeat of the season to a second-ranked Notre Dame team, but their path to the National Championship was cleared a week later when the Irish were upset at home by Boston College. Ward holds the third-largest margin of victory in the history of Heisman trophy balloting, with a 1,622-point difference, third only to O.J. Simpson's 1,750-point win in 1968 and Troy Smith's 1,662-point win in 2006. He was also the only Heisman winner to play in the NBA. In 1993, Charlie Ward won the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. Though Ward did not play baseball in college, he was drafted as a pitcher by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 59th round of the 1993 free agent draft and in the 18th round by the New York Yankees in 1994. An avid tennis player, Ward also shone in the Arthur Ashe Amateur Tennis Tournament in 1994. Ward was a model student-athlete at Florida State. As a senior and captain of the team in 1993, he voluntarily approached Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden about a difficult situation surrounding incoming freshman Warrick Dunn, whose mother, policewoman Betty Smothers, was killed in the line of duty during Dunn's senior year of high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Charlie served as a surrogate big brother to Dunn during the latter's first year in Tallahassee, helping him through a trying time by becoming his roommate and friend. With Ward's help on and off the field, Dunn eventually became one of the better running backs in the country and a first-round NFL draft pick. Ward also played basketball for four years at Florida State University (FSU). Former teammates included future NBA players Bob Sura, Doug Edwards, and Sam Cassell. His 1993 team made it to the Southeast Regional Final where they lost to Kentucky 106-81 with the winner advancing to the Final Four. Ward's 1992 team made the Sweet Sixteen. He made the game-winning shot in its Metro Conference Tournament Championship game win over Louisville in 1991. Ward still holds FSU basketball records for career steals at 236, steals in one game at 9 and still ranks sixth all-time in assists at 396. He played a shortened season his senior year, joining the basketball team just 15 days after winning the Heisman Trophy. He started 16 games at the point guard position that year, and averaged a college career high of 10.5 points and 4.9 assists for the season. In his senior year at Florida State, he also served as Student Government Vice-President, after he was asked to run by the Monarchy Party, a student government reform organization.

Premise: Four tourists are looking at a mountain. Hypothesis: A man catches the ball. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Given the premise \\"Four tourists are looking at a mountain,\\" we cannot conclude the hypothesis \\"A man catches the ball.\\" The premise and hypothesis are unrelated and do not provide any information about each other. Let's take a closer look at both statements to understand why they are unrelated and cannot be used to make any conclusions. The premise: \\"Four tourists are looking at a mountain.\\" In this scenario, we have information about four people (tourists) observing a natural landscape (a mountain). The statement focuses on the activity of sightseeing and the tourists' shared interest in the mountain. The hypothesis: \\"A man catches the ball.\\" This statement involves an individual (a man) performing a physical action (catching a ball). There is no mention of tourists, mountains, or sightseeing in this hypothesis. The focus here is on a specific event, which is the man catching the ball. To effectively conclude a hypothesis from a given premise, there should be some relevant connection or logical link between the two. In this case, there is no connection because: 1. The premise discusses tourists and their activities, while the hypothesis mentions a man and his action. There is no overlap between the characters involved in each statement. 2. The settings described are different. The premise is set on a mountain, while the hypothesis does not provide any information about the setting. The premise implies a relaxed, observational atmosphere, whereas the hypothesis suggests an active situation involving a ball. 3. The actions in each statement are unrelated. Looking at a mountain is a passive visual activity, while catching a ball is a physical one. It's impossible to establish a logical relationship between these actions based solely on the given information. In conclusion, we cannot derive the presented hypothesis from the given premise because they share no common elements or logical connections. For an effective conclusion, the premise and hypothesis need to be related or interconnected in some way that rationalizes the progression from one statement to the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the doctor that commented on a symphony written by a man who based it on works of a 13th century poet? from the following article ? Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces. Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th-century Persian poet Rumi...

Information: - The Posavac Hound ( FCI No. 154 ) ( Croatian : posavski goni ) is a breed of dog , originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type . Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to: - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.

Everyone else seems to when they find out that one of the two skeletons that we keep around went missing this week. Even the security guard struggled to keep a straight face when we reported the crime. The life-size skeleton and her miniature sidekick are a playful reminder of the business that we are in. They occasionally provide much-needed comic relief and often cause tour groups to break out laughing. Fellow journalists have admitted to stopping by just to eyeball the latest in skeletal couture. In spring, the skeletons wear a Gothic-inspired wedding ensemble and every summer they don Hawaiian prints and hula skirts. Throughout 2008, they sported a campaign theme -- the little guy was swathed in campaign buttons that were removed as presidential candidates fell by the wayside while the bigger one wore a poufy skirt that slowly turned into a political graveyard as headlines were pinned on it to track who had left the race.

From what I noticed from the Friday night crowd at Tapino's and the poor customer service, I don't think this strip mall blunder is going to make it! pick from the following. A). negative. B). positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the review given is A). Negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction and disappointment with multiple aspects of their experience at Tapino, which contribute to the negative sentiment of their review. Here's a breakdown of the main points that lead to the negative assessment: 1. The reviewer starts by suggesting that the staff at Tapino need to learn the meaning of \\"Hospitality,\\" implying that the level of customer service and warmth they experienced at the restaurant was inadequate. 2. They mention feeling offended as a patron of the restaurant, which conveys negative emotions and disappointment with their experience. 3. They describe two instances where the owner or manager came to their table to lecture them about keeping the noise down. The reviewer finds this particularly frustrating, since there was only one other table occupied in the restaurant. This leads to feelings of annoyance and a negative experience. 4. The reviewer then shares that they decided to cancel their appetizers and leave Tapino for another restaurant, Mastro's City Hall, where they spent 1,000 and received better treatment. This comparison highlights the difference in the quality of service, further emphasizing the dissatisfaction with Tapino. 5. Lastly, the reviewer comments on the lack of a bustling Friday night crowd at Tapino and the poor customer service they experienced, speculating that the restaurant may not survive due to these shortcomings. All these points clearly present a negative sentiment in the review, as the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction, annoyance, disappointment, and frustration with their experience at Tapino."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The lawyer, John Henry Browne, held a news conference in Seattle on Thursday and also spoke to some reporters individually. He told The Associated Press that the day before the massacre, a friend of the sergeant had lost a leg in an explosion. That could not be independently confirmed. The comments by the lawyer, and the account by the American official, confirmed by a senior official at the Pentagon, are the most detailed descriptions so far of the state of the sergeant, a 38-year-old married father of two who was on his first combat tour in Afghanistan but his fourth over all, including three in Iraq , since he enlisted in 2001. “There will be questions raised about his emotional and mental stability for a fourth deployment,” the American official said. The Army still has not named the soldier, but on Thursday a lawyer who said he had been retained by his family offered some information and questioned some of the American official’s claims. Mr. Browne said it was “nonsense” that there were exceptional marital tensions. “I know that is not true,” he said at a news conference at his office Thursday night in Seattle. Mr. Browne added that the inaccuracy of the claim made him “suspicious” of the suggestion that alcohol and stress contributed, though he noted that virtually anyone at a remote base in Afghanistan would be under stress. Video The soldier and his wife had “a very healthy marriage,” Mr. Browne said. Their two children are 3 and 4 years old.

Mr. Browne, who said he met with “a very large group of family members” on Wednesday and spoke with the soldier by telephone on Thursday, said the man had “been decorated many, many times. He’s been to Iraq twice. He was injured twice and he was deployed back to Afghanistan. He is a career military man.” He added, “He was injured in Iraq in two places on his body, so he wasn’t certain he was healthy enough to go back, physically.” Mr. Browne said the soldier suffered a concussion during a vehicle rollover accident caused by a roadside bomb. He also lost part of a foot in another episode. He confirmed that the soldier, part of the Third Stryker Brigade, Second Infantry, had served three tours in Iraq with that unit. He declined to say whether the sergeant might have psychological or mental health issues, and he also would not say whether the soldier had confessed. Mr. Browne said he would wait for the government to release the man’s name. Mr. Browne criticized anonymous reports from government officials, calling them baseless. “The government is going to want to blame this on an individual rather than blame it on the war,” he said. Mr. Browne said that his client had been based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, just south of Tacoma , Wash., for his entire career. He said that many but not all of his family members had moved from the Midwest to western Washington. He said the soldier had done “blue collar” work in the Midwest before he enlisted. The soldier’s wife had “a very good job,” he said, noting that he was being paid, not working on the case pro bono.

What threat can Google Optimize posses to companies like Optimizely, VWO, Adobe Test & Target etc? What kind of practices should I follow to get recruited into a product based companies like Google, Microsoft, Adobe, etc?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. They address different topics, although both involve prominent tech companies like Google and Adobe. 1. The first question is related to market competition and the potential threats that a product or service from one company (in this case, Google Optimize) can pose to other companies offering similar products or services (Optimizely, VWO, Adobe Test & Target etc). It invites an analysis of the competitive landscape in the specific sector of online optimization tools. Google Optimize, being a Google product, could pose several threats to these companies, most significantly due to Google's vast resources, extensive user base and power in the digital world. Plus, Google Optimize is tightly integrated with other Google services — such as Google Analytics — making it a convenient one-stop solution for customers already using these services. Given Google's renowned technology and consistent innovation, it could introduce advanced features and capabilities in Optimize that outshine those of its competitors. Another possible threat is pricing: Google could offer similar or even superior capabilities at a lower price, or include Optimize capabilities as part of a broader package of services. 2. The second question inquires about best practices or strategies to follow in order to get recruited by product-based companies like Google, Microsoft, Adobe, etc. Here, the discussion revolves around job recruitment procedures, required skills, qualifications and experiences, and the possible strategies to stand out during the hiring process in prestigious tech companies. To get recruited into product-based companies, one should be skilled in problem-solving, coding, and have a good grasp of data structures and algorithms. A strong knowledge in the domain related to the company's product, internships, and projects demonstrating relevant skills can add value. Higher studies or certifications from recognized bodies can help, as can a strong network within the industry. Applicants should demonstrate soft skills like communication, team work and leadership. It's also helpful to be up-to-date with the company's latest products and technologies. Also, each company has a different recruitment process. Preparing for written tests, multiple rounds of technical interviews and HR interviews are general steps. Utilizing resources like LinkedIn and GitHub, enhancing profiles with demonstrated skills and projects, and making the right connections can also be crucial. In essence, while both questions involve tech companies, the first question relates to market competition, hypothesis around product strengths, and dynamics, while the second question involves recruitment strategies and career planning in the tech industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Japanese authorities are expected to announce Friday that a \\"cold shutdown\\" has been achieved at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That would mean the plant's crippled reactors have stayed at temperatures below the boiling point for some time. The announcement is a symbolic milestone. But experts say it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. The plume of radioactive particles that spewed from Fukushima Daiichi -- where reactor cooling systems failed in the aftermath of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in March -- displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) radius of the plant, as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest. The government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes. Significant work -- with significant risks -- remains to be done at the plant. \\"This is far from over, and the work will go on for a long time,\\" Tokyo Electric Power Co. President Toshio Nishizawa told CNN this week. Citing government sources, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported Thursday that scrapping crippled reactors at the plant could take up to 40 years. In October, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric -- which owns the plant -- said temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred had already been brought down below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), but the company would have to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown. \\"They're making this out to be some big milestone, some big thing. But the reality of this is that it's not,\\" said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. \\"The problem is, with these reactors and the condition that they're in, to suggest that they're in cold shutdown really doesn't do justice to the situation. They're no safer today than they were basically in June.\\" Officials could start removing spent fuel rods from the facility next year, but it could be up to a decade before they are able to access the reactor vessels, he said. \\"They'll probably spend two or three years studying it,\\" he said. Jack DeVine, who helped lead the cleanup of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant after the 1979 partial meltdown there, said the cold shutdown likely means officials may have one less thing to worry about. If they don't have to use as much water to cool the reactors, they also don't have to worry about what to do with contaminated cooling water -- one of many problems that have plagued workers at the crippled plant. \\"It's not like there's a dramatic difference. It's just a gradual incremental difference that does make life easier,\\" he said. The earthquake and tsunami on March 11 killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern Japan. The country was on edge for weeks as cooling systems failed and utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a nuclear catastrophe at the six-reactor Daiichi plant, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Hydrogen explosions blew apart the No. 1 and No. 3 reactor housings, while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the No. 2 reactor. Fires believed caused by heat from the No. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit's reactor building. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency eventually categorized the accident as a level-7 event -- the highest level on an international scale for nuclear disasters -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. \\"We are going to check each reactor properly and determine what is going to happen to those left,\\" Nishizawa, the Tokyo Electric president, said Wednesday. Removing spent fuel rods is the next step, but officials need to further survey the area before that happens, he said. \\"We are considering sending a robot into the fuel tanks to really have a good idea (about) the situation. This will be necessary when we take out the fuel,\\" Nishizawa said. \\"But I don't believe what we see will be 180 degrees different from our simulations. But as we say, seeing once is better than hearing 100 times, so we will have a good look at what's happening inside.\\" At Three Mile Island, where damage was less severe and only one reactor was affected, it took two and half years before officials were able to get inside the reactor to assess it, DeVine said. At Fukushima Daiichi, that process will likely take much longer, he said. \\"I think in terms of what's ahead, it's still the daunting task that it's always been, which is first of all, figuring out where everything is. ... They're going to be searching for and finding pieces of fuel, chunks of molten material that have now cooled, through all of that rubble,\\" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Matt Smith in Atlanta, and Licia Yee in Tokyo contributed to this report.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors? In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal. In Swedish civil process, the \\"English rule\\" applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the American rule, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012. The answer is:","completion":"The defendant has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press, such as libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme).

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who distracts Ben with talk?, using the article: Ben Mockridge is a young man proud of his 4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin'\\". He asks Frank Culpepper if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly—or simply fails at—repeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight. Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell, he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying—they immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief.

Summarize: On a fake pair of Yeezys, the stitching is a messy criss-cross. The real ones have neat stitching that creates an “X” on both sides with a square separating them. Fake Yeezys could have any number of dots, but real Yeezys have exactly 9 in the center box. The dots outside the rectangle don't count. On fake Yeezys, the stripes look like they've been printed on. A quick way to verify the shoe’s authenticity is by judging the material. A fake pair of Yeezys has a softer fabric, making it easy to identify as a counterfeit. The shoe’s tongue is another dead giveaway regarding its realness. A fake pair of Yeezy's soft material makes the tongue slouchier, while a real pair stands straight up.","completion":"The passage provides a comprehensive summary of the distinctive characteristics present in fake and real Yeezy shoes, focusing on aspects such as stitching patterns, dot count, stripe appearance, material quality, and tongue structure. To differentiate between fake and authentic Yeezys, one must examine the stitching closely. Authentic Yeezys exhibit neat stitching that forms an \\"X\\" on both sides with a square separating them, while fake ones showcase messy criss-cross stitching. Additionally, scrutinizing the dot count within the center box also aids in establishing a shoe's authenticity. Genuine Yeezys will have precisely nine dots, whereas fake ones may have varying numbers. It is important to note that dots outside the rectangle should not be considered during this assessment. The appearance of the stripes can also offer vital clues, as counterfeit Yeezys usually have stripes that look printed on. In contrast, the material of the shoe is a quick way to verify its legitimacy. Counterfeit Yeezys use a softer fabric that is easier to identify when compared to the higher-quality material used in authentic pairs. Lastly, observing the shoe's tongue can reveal significant indications about its authenticity. A fake Yeezy's tongue, due to the softer material, tends to be slouchier, whereas the tongue of an authentic pair would stand straight up. By considering all these factors, one can effectively determine the difference between fake and real Yeezy shoes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Young people under 21 are finding ways to get to alcohol regardless of the laws and restrictions anyway so so much for the enforcement . I would not be ok with them changing the law to below 18 because hoenstly teenagers can be incredible stupid and they have a tendency to have that Icarus complex where they think they are invincible and nothing can hurt them so they make idiotic choices and get hurt . People under 21 drink all the time so is it really a matter of lowering the drinking age much less being able to enforce the restrictions ? Possible answers: (1). Many teenagers will continue to drink no matter what the limit is .. (2). More drunk driving accidents will increase .. (3). Alcohol may become outlawed again .. (4). None of the above choices .. Answer the following question: What may happen after the drinking age is lowered ?","completion":"Answer: Many teenagers will continue to drink no matter what the limit is. If we take an example of a rule we might have at home - think of it as your rule of not eating candy before dinner. Even if your parents change the rule to say you can have a candy not just before dinner, but also before lunch, you would still want to eat candy before breakfast as well. That's how it works with drinking age too. Teenagers who are already drinking will likely to continue doing so no matter what the limit is. More drunk driving accidents increasing is wrong as it's not a certain outcome of lowering the drinking age - it could actually decrease if teens are educated properly about drinking and driving. Alcohol become outlawed again is incorrect because outlawing something doesn't always solve problems - remember when your parents tried to hide all the candies and you still found them? None of the above choices is also not correct because one of the choices (many teenagers will continue to drink no matter what the limit is) is correct.

Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that blood sugar levels increase in the body. The effects of increased blood sugar levels are as follows: 1. Blood sugar levels increase in the body. 2. The increase is sensed by specialized cells in the pancreas (primarily beta cells). 3. In response, the pancreas starts releasing insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin acts as a key to help glucose enter cells. 4. As cells in the muscles, fat, and liver take in glucose with the help of insulin, they store it in the form of glycogen or convert it into energy. 5. The increased glucose uptake by the cells reduces the glucose concentration in the bloodstream, and blood sugar levels decrease. The perturbation hypothesis affects the process indirectly. When blood sugar levels increase, it does not directly lead to more glucose production. Instead, it affects the secretion of insulin by the pancreas, which helps regulate the uptake of glucose by cells in the body. Consequently, insulin has a direct effect on subsequent glucose production, as it helps cells take in glucose and stimulates the liver to store the excess glucose as glycogen. In summary, when blood sugar levels increase, it triggers a different response in the body that involves insulin. This response affects glucose production and uptake, ensuring that blood glucose concentrations are properly regulated and maintained within a healthy range."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Theodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (\\"Theodros II Doukas Laskaris\\") (1221/1222 August 18, 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258. - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD 22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD. - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261. - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek : ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s . - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city. - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina (). - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent. Risk factors for glaucoma include increased pressure in the eye, a family history of the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than is often used with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be slow exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is by a dilated eye examination. Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping. If treated early it is possible to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure. A number of different classes of glaucoma medication are available. Laser treatments may be effective in both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. A number of types of glaucoma surgeries may be used in people who do not respond sufficiently to other measures. Treatment of closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. About 11 to 67 million people have glaucoma globally. The disease affects about 2 million people in the United States. It occurs more commonly among older people. Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in... - Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses. Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60. The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss. Visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving, reading, socializing, and walking. The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%). Refractive errors include near sighted, far sighted, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness. Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections. Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, prematurity, or trauma among others. These cases are known as cortical visual impairment. Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement. Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit. Diagnosis is by an eye exam. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environmental, and assistive devices. As of 2012 there were 285 million people who were visually impaired of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over... - A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision . It can affect one or both eyes . Often it develops slowly . Symptoms may include faded colors , blurry vision , halos around light , trouble with bright lights , and trouble seeing at night . This may result in trouble driving , reading , or recognizing faces . Poor vision may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression . Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33 % of visual impairment worldwide . Cataracts are most commonly due to aging , but may also occur due to trauma , radiation exposure , be present from birth , or occur following eye surgery for other problems . Risk factors include diabetes , smoking tobacco , prolonged exposure to sunlight , and alcohol . Either clumps of protein or yellow - brown pigment may be deposited in the lens reducing the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye . Diagnosis is by an eye examination . Prevention includes wearing sunglasses and not smoking . Early on the symptoms may be improved with eyeglasses . If this does not help , surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens is the only effective treatment . Surgery is only needed if the cataracts are causing problems . Surgery generally results in an improved quality of life . Cataract surgery is not easily available in many countries , which is especially true for women , those living in rural areas , and those who can not read . About 20 million people globally are blind due to cataracts . It is the cause of about 5 % of blindness in the United States and nearly 60 % of blindness in parts of Africa and South America . Blindness from cataracts occurs in about 10 to 40 per 100,000 children in the developing world and 1 to 4 per 100,000 children in the developed world . Cataracts become more common with age . About half the people in the United States have had cataracts by the age of 80 . - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses). - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths. - Trachoma, also called granular conjunctivitis, Egyptian ophthalmia, and blinding trachoma, is an infectious disease caused by bacterium \\"Chlamydia trachomatis\\". The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea of the eyes, and eventual blindness. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections can result in a form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward. The bacteria that cause the disease can be spread by both direct and indirect contact with an affected person's eyes or nose. Indirect contact includes through clothing or flies that have come into contact with an affected person's eyes or nose. Children spread the disease more often than adults. Poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and not enough clean water and toilets also increase spread. Efforts to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and decreasing the number of people infected by treatment with antibiotics. This may include treating, all at once, whole groups of people in whom the disease is known to be common. Washing by itself is not enough to prevent disease but may be useful with other measures. Treatment options include oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline. Azithromycin is preferred because it can be used as a single oral dose. After scarring of the eyelid has occurred, surgery may be required to correct the position of the eyelashes and prevent blindness. Globally, about 80 million people have an active infection. In some areas infections may be present in as many as 6090% of children and it more commonly affects women than men likely due to their closer contact with children. The disease is the cause of decreased vision in 2.2 million people of whom 1.2 million are completely blind. It commonly occurs in 53 countries of Africa, Asia, Central and South America with about 230 million people at risk. It results in US8 billion of economic losses a year. It belongs to a group of diseases known as... - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from... - In ophthalmology, high-energy visible light (HEV light) is high-frequency, high-energy light in the violet/blue band from 400 to 500 nm in the visible spectrum.

Q: The scientific team of Dr. David Conway (William Leslie), Dr. Ellis Morton (Tristram Coffin) and Laura Hutchinson (Kathryn Grant) has built a machine that can predict earthquakes. After predicting one will hit California within the next 24 hours to a uniformly skeptical Gov. Cheney (Raymond Greenleaf) and state-level political and civil defense officials, the earthquake does materialize and does immense damage to northern parts of the state. Now with the support and funding necessary from the reformed skeptics, the team works on further predictions and comes to the conclusion that a wave of earthquakes are pending in and around the southwestern United States. They trace the epicenter of the pending disaster to an area beneath the Carlsbad Caverns and descend to a hitherto unexplored level.Here they find a strange ore which, when removed from contact with water, becomes highly explosive, and realize that this element, somehow working its way from deep in the Earth, is responsible for the earthquakes. Although the material is not analyzed for specific atomic traits, it is named Element 112 just because so far, 111 chemical elements had been discovered. A computer determines that in approximately one month, enough of Element 112 will emerge from the deep earth to cause the entire planet to explode. A desperate operation ensues worldwide to blast and trench the ground to let water in and cover Element 112, keeping it from drying out and expanding., Question: The strange ore that they find becomes highly explosive when it is removed from contact with what substance?

His unique ability to think like the perpetrators he's hunting has earned him high praise and success in his career, but it's also resulted in a balanced yet slowly corroding personal life. The movie begins with Novak attending the elaborate gala of a renowned humanitarian and billionaire, Jonathan King. He is there under the guise of a guest but is secretly investigating a recent series of high-profile abductions happening in the city. All these victims have one major similarity - they are all directly or indirectly linked to Jonathan King. Although he is widely respected, certain skeletons in his closet are suspected to be the cause of these abductions. One night, a desperate call from Claire, Jonathan King's daughter, becomes the turning point. Claire is on the run, terrified for her life after narrowly escaping an abduction attempt. Novak promises to protect her, but to do that, it is imperative that she trusts him, which is hard considering Novak is investigating her father. A fragile alliance forms, and the cat and mouse game begins. Novak starts tracking down each victim's location with the clues shared by Claire and the little information he can gather from the ongoing investigations. He discovers multiple safe houses with high-tech security systems, making him realize that these abductions are not random acts, but part of a larger, systematic operation involving big names. Each step brings Novak closer to the truth, but he isn't prepared for the shocking conspiracy he uncovers. Eminent members of society are part of a secret society that's using the victims in human trafficking. Jonathan King, despite his reputation, is the linchpin in this operation. The shocking revelation sends Novak to the edge, questioning his loyalties and his duty as a protector of law and order. In the climax, Novak devises a plan to expose the syndicate and rescue the victims. He infiltrates Jonathan's mansion during a party for the city's elites. With the help of Claire, they manage to sneak into Jonathan's private chamber where they find concrete evidence against him and the secret society. Novak, using his skills, manages to broadcast the criminal activities to all the guests, causing chaos and leading to several arrests. The movie concludes with Novak seeing Jonathan and the society members facing justice for their horrific crimes. He exhales a breath he felt he'd been holding since the start of his investigation. Claire, despite her father's heinous actions, finally breathes a sigh of relief, free of the life-long shackles and ready to carve out a future that's her own, under Novak's watchful protection. The plot encapsulates an intense narrative of betrayal, justice, secrets, and redemption. Novak as the protagonist exemplifies the antagonist's flip side, where power can be used for protecting justice instead of exploiting the vulnerable. With this plot, the narration delves into edgy thriller sequences, high-octane chase scenes, and a dash of emotional turmoil, making it a gripping watch."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line.

Article:","completion":"Title: Southern Network Passengers to be Compensated Amidst Long-Running Disruptions Introduction: Southern Rail commuters have been battling with frustrating delays, cancellations, and congestion due to long-running disruptions on the railway network. However, in light of this ongoing inconvenience, the government and rail operator have announced a plan to repay passengers the equivalent of a month's travel, bringing some relief to countless individuals who depend on this major transport system. Background: Southern Rail is a major British train operating company responsible for providing rail services across South London, Surrey, and Sussex. The company also links central London to various destinations across the south coast. In recent years, however, Southern Rail has become synonymous with delays and cancelations, causing severe disturbances for passengers. The Disruptions: For years, Southern Rail's service has faced disruptions, including delays, overcrowded trains, and cancelations. Frequent rail strikes have contributed to these issues, leading to chaos and confusion in the daily schedules of thousands of passengers. The series of strikes has arisen as a result of ongoing disputes between the rail unions, the train operating company Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern Rail under the trading name Southern, and the Government. These disputes often centre around driver-only operation (DOO) trains, which eliminate the need for a guard onboard. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) have both expressed concerns about the safety of DOO trains, as well as uncertainty regarding job security for staff members. The long periods of strikes and labor disputes have tremendously impacted the services provided by Southern Rail, causing disruptions that leave passengers frustrated and severely inconvenienced. These issues have left the train operator exposed to criticism, with commuter groups and political figures calling for improvements to the rail services and compensation for affected passengers. The Compensation Plan: In response to the continuous disruptions, the government and rail operator have agreed to compensate passengers on the Southern network with the equivalent of a month's travel expenses. This announcement, although long overdue, demonstrates an acknowledgment of the inconveniences that passengers have been forced to accept. This compensation plan aims to provide some relief to the affected commuters. It is, however, crucial for the train operators and unions to continue working towards resolving the underlying issues that contribute to rail disruptions. A significant step in that direction would be the commitment to collaborating and ensuring clear lines of communication, thus allowing for smoother negotiations and the formulation of concrete solutions to the ongoing problems. Affected passengers can apply for compensation in the coming weeks, with all relevant details expected to be made available on the Southern Rail website. Conclusion: While the one-month travel compensation is a much-needed gesture of goodwill to the Southern Rail passengers, the situation highlights the importance of investing time, resources, and efforts in addressing the underlying issues that plague the rail services. Efforts towards improving the standards and reliability of rail transport should continue relentlessly to ensure a better experience for passengers, who depend heavily on it for their daily commute. This action by the government and rail operator is just the first step towards rebuilding trust with commuters and must be supported by long-term improvements to the quality of Southern Rail's services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The choices we make every day, from the food we eat to the amount of physical activity we engage in, have a huge impact on our overall well-being. In this article, we will explore four key steps that can lead to a healthier, happier you: losing any extra weight, starting a regular exercise routine, indulging in the occasional glass of wine, and quitting smoking. By making these essential changes to your daily routine, you'll be well on your way to improving your health and extending your years of wellbeing. 1. Shedding Extra Weight One of the most effective ways to enhance your overall health is by losing any extra weight you may be carrying. Carrying excess weight puts stress on your organs, joints, and cardiovascular system, increasing your risk of developing various health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Here are some strategies for shedding those extra pounds: - Set realistic goals: Target a weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week to ensure the process is gradual and sustainable. Studies have shown that sudden and drastic weight loss may cause more harm than good. - Eat a balanced diet: Choose nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats to help regulate blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and promote satiety. - Portion control: Use smaller plates and be mindful of serving sizes to avoid overeating. Avoid distractions while eating and give your body enough time to process signals of fullness. - Stay hydrated: Drinking adequate amounts of water can help suppress appetite and assist in digesting the food we consume. 2. Starting a Regular Exercise Routine Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining overall health. Not only does it help burn calories and maintain a healthy body weight, but it also improves cardiovascular health, increases energy levels, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. Some tips for establishing a regular exercise routine: - Choose an activity you enjoy: Whether it is running, walking, swimming, or dancing, find an exercise routine that you enjoy to ensure you stick to it. - Incorporate variety: Mix up your exercise routine to prevent boredom and reduce the risk of injury. Combine aerobic activities, strength training, and flexibility exercises for a balanced routine. - Schedule your workouts: Pencil in regular workout sessions on your calendar and treat them as non-negotiable appointments. - Start slow and progress gradually: Ensure your exercise routine is safe and comfortable by beginning with low-intensity workouts and gradually increasing the intensity and duration. 3. Enjoying the Occasional Glass of Wine Research has shown that moderate wine consumption can have certain health benefits. For instance, red wine contains antioxidants like resveratrol, which may improve heart health and increase good cholesterol levels. However, it is essential to maintain moderation, as excessive alcohol consumption can lead to negative health effects. Here are some guidelines for enjoying wine responsibly: - Limit your intake: For men, up to two glasses of wine per day is considered moderate, while for women, it is one glass. - Choose wine over other alcoholic beverages: Due to their antioxidant content, red wines (in moderation) are generally considered a healthier option compared to other alcoholic drinks. - Consult your doctor: If you have any health conditions or concerns, always discuss your alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider before making any changes. 4. Quitting Smoking Quitting smoking can be one of the most challenging yet rewarding lifestyle changes you can make. Smoking is responsible for numerous health issues, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, and stroke. Here are some tips for quitting smoking successfully: - Set a quit date: Choose a specific day to quit smoking and make a plan to avoid triggers and situations that may lead to relapse. - Consider nicotine replacement therapy or medication: Consult with your doctor to discuss nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., patches, gum, or lozenges) or prescription medications that can aid in quitting smoking. - Join a support group: Connect with others who are quitting smoking for encouragement, sharing experiences, and getting helpful advice. - Stay focused on the benefits: Remind yourself of the benefits of quitting smoking, such as improved health, better breath, and saving money, to keep yourself motivated on this challenging journey. Conclusion Losing extra weight, starting a regular exercise routine, enjoying the occasional glass of wine, and quitting smoking are all essential components of living a healthy and fulfilling life. By taking these steps, you can significantly improve your physical and mental well-being and extend your years of quality living. Remember, the journey to health is incremental, and every positive change counts – so start today and cherish the benefits of a healthier, happier you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The author is likely knowledgeable about the Mediterranean diet and its health benefits, and is concerned about the prevalence of unhealthy eating habits, particularly in American society. They advocate for healthier food choices and are against the notion that healthy food cannot be delicious."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: There are as many types of curators as there are types of museums - art museums, history museums, children’s museums, science museums, and a vast range of specializations in between. You will need to choose what sort of museum you want to work for in order to pursue the appropriate education. Consider what experiences have influenced your desire to be a museum curator. Were you inspired by an Aztec history exhibit you saw on a school field trip? Do you dream of working in a place like the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Be as specific as possible. If you know you want to work in a science museum, think about what aspects of science interest you the most. Chemistry? Physics? Astronomy? The more specific your choice, the more extensively you can educate yourself in it. Many colleges offer Bachelor’s degrees in museology, or museum studies, but it’s not absolutely necessary that you choose this as your major. Museums will look for candidates with extensive education and experience in a field that is relevant to what they’re curating, such as art or history, as well as knowledge of business administration, marketing, and fundraising. Bachelor’s degrees typically take 4 years to complete, although it may take more if you choose a double major. By this time, you should have some idea of what subject you want to focus on. If you became particularly interested in African art while getting your Bachelor’s in art history, look for Master’s programs that have a focus in African art. Look at the faculty of graduate departments as well as the programs. Who you work with can have a great impact on your education, as well as your career. Many curators find jobs through the recommendations of professors in their field, so building a good relationship with faculty is a must. Graduate programs typically take between 1.5 and 3 years to complete. Many lower-level curatorial positions only require a Master’s, but if you want to become curator at a national museum, you’ll need a PhD. This should be in the field you wish to specialize in. Because of the competitive nature of this field, a specialized degree is increasingly necessary. You want to demonstrate as much expertise in whatever you hope to curate as possible. When you choose a subject for your thesis, it’s ideal to find something unique that will stand out from other research in your field. Educate yourself on what research has already been done and aim to make a distinctive contribution. PhD programs typically take at least 5 years (the average length, however, is 8.2 years).","completion":"The article discusses the process of becoming a museum curator and emphasizes the various types of museums and specializations available.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Islamic militants, Kurds resume fierce fighting in Syrian town near Turkey SURUC, Turkey – A suicide bomber from the Islamic State extremist group detonated his explosives-laden vehicle in Kobani on Monday, as fierce fighting with Kurdish militiamen resumed in the northern Syrian town near the Turkish border. The sound of explosions and occasional gunfire could be heard across the border from Kobani a day after Kurdish fighters managed to slow the advance of the jihadist group. What appeared to be a rocket-propelled grenade struck a minaret in the center of the town, emitting a cloud of white smoke. Activists said Islamic State militants were carrying out a three-pronged attack from the eastern side of the town and that clashes were ongoing in the southern part. The Syrian Kurdish enclave has been the scene of heavy fighting since late last month, with the better-armed Islamic State fighters determined to capture the border post. The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorized religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers. A U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against militant targets in and around Kobani for more than two weeks, and the town's fate has emerged as a major test of whether the air campaign can roll back the extremists in Syria. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an Islamic State suicide bomber detonated a car filled with explosives in the northern part of Kobani near the border with Turkey on Monday. It said the car was headed to the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey. A Kurdish activist in the town, Farhad Shami, said the vehicle appeared to have exploded prematurely. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Shami said coalition aircraft were flying over Kobani and had struck 10 times Sunday and Monday.","completion":"A suicide bomber from the Islamic State extremist group detonated an explosives-laden vehicle in Kobani, a northern Syrian town near the Turkish border.

(CNN) -- The former head of an Air Force sexual assault prevention program was acquitted Wednesday of an assault charge stemming from an incident in Arlington, Virginia, last spring, his lawyer confirmed to CNN. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 42, was arrested in May and accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County, not far from the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated.

Wilhelm Justus Goebel was born January 4, 1856, in Albany Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, the son of Wilhelm and Augusta (Groenkle) Goebel, immigrants from Hanover, Germany. The first of four children, he was born two months premature and weighed less than three pounds. His father served as a private in Company B, 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, and Goebel's mother raised her children alone, teaching them much about their German heritage. Wilhelm spoke only German until the age of six, but embraced the culture of his birth country as well, adopting the English spelling of his name. Three men sought the Democratic nomination for governor at the 1899 party convention in Louisville - Goebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin appeared to be the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone-Goebel alliance. Goebel took a calculated risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now be able to secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced the man with the lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. Enough of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination. Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party. A disgruntled faction calling themselves the \\"Honest Election Democrats\\" held a separate convention in Lexington and nominated John Y. Brown for governor. Republican William S. Taylor defeated both Democratic candidates in the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2-1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on the brink of a possible civil war. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who won this election?","completion":"In simple words, the election was very confusing and had a lot of problems. At first, a man named William S. Taylor won, but later, some people looked at the votes again and decided that Wilhelm Goebel should win. So, they said Goebel won the election.

If \\"Girl hanging upside down with city in the background.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Girl sitting in a field in the country.\\"?","completion":"No, it doesn't logically follow that if there is a \\"Girl hanging upside down with a city in the background,\\" there must also be a \\"Girl sitting in a field in the country.\\" However, it is important to note that these are two distinct scenarios which could potentially be related or unrelated, depending on the context given. To determine if a logical connection exists, let us examine the elements of these two scenarios. 1. In the first scenario, a girl is hanging upside down, which indicates that she could be engaging in a playful, adventurous, or even dangerous activity. This shows an element of action or movement. 2. The city in the background provides a potential setting for this scenario, suggesting an urban environment. This can encompass a variety of locations, such as parks, playgrounds, or rooftops. The presence of the city also implies a certain level of modernization, infrastructure, and population density. 3. In the second scenario, a girl is sitting in a field, which illustrates a more relaxed and peaceful activity. This reflects an element of stillness or calm. 4. The country setting implies a rural environment, with open spaces and natural landscapes. This might include elements such as farmland, fields, or forests. Based on these distinctions, it is clear that these two scenarios possess contrasting themes: action versus stillness and urban versus rural. As such, they represent different settings and actions taking place independently of each other. If the scenarios were presented as part of a larger story or concept, there could potentially be a link connecting them, such as a common character or a thematic connection. However, with the information provided, it cannot be concluded that the presence of a \\"Girl hanging upside down with a city in the background\\" logically necessitates the existence of a \\"Girl sitting in a field in the country.\\" There could be numerous other scenarios that could exist independently or in conjunction with these two, which further underscores the absence of a logical connection between the two situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are boosters to the brain and better therapy than some guide books, researchers say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" Question: What might be the author's attitude towards reading classics as therapy? - Doubtful - Positive - Indifferent - Opposing A:","completion":"Positive"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef.

The phrase in Russian, \\"Экскурсия фокусируется, в основном, на эпохе норманнского правителя Федерико II,\\" can be translated to English as \\"The excursion primarily focuses on the era of the Norman ruler Federico II.\\" Federico II, also known as Frederick II, was a Holy Roman Emperor, King of Sicily, and King of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages. He was a central figure in the historical landscape of 13th-century Europe, and his reign marked considerable achievements in literature, science, and law. Frederick II was often called Stupor Mundi, which means \\"the wonder of the world,\\" as his court was a center of intellectual and artistic excellence. During this time, Norman influence had extended throughout Southern Italy and Sicily, creating a rich cultural and historical heritage. Under Federico II's rule, these territories flourished in areas such as architecture, blending Norman, Byzantine, and Islamic architectural styles to create impressive structures like the Castel del Monte. An excursion that focuses on this era would typically include visits to historical sites and monuments that reflect the cultural influences and accomplishments of Federico II's reign. Participants can expect to learn about the political, social, and artistic developments of the time, as well as the complex relations between different cultures, religions, and regions under Norman rule. In addition, such an excursion might also explore the broader context of the Norman presence in Southern Italy and Sicily, discussing the earlier Norman conquests led by figures such as Robert Guiscard and Roger II. By exploring these events, participants might gain a deeper understanding of the conditions that ultimately led to the rise of Federico II and his lasting impact on the region's history and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The question for Parliament is: Can this Parliament do something at the European level to reverse this development? In response to this question, let me provide a detailed answer on what can be done by the Parliament on the European level to reverse the development in question: To address the concern, the European Parliament can take several actions, each of which requires collaboration among member states, at the institutional, regulatory, and financial levels. Here is an overview of possible steps that can contribute to reversing the ongoing development: 1. Legislative Initiatives: The European Parliament can promote new legislative proposals or recommend amendments to existing laws overseeing this particular development. By reshaping the legal framework, Parliament may create favorable conditions for steering the change in the desired direction. 2. Policies and Strategies: Parliament can work towards the development of a comprehensive policy or strategy encompassing the entire European Union. This may include setting common goals, designing guidelines, and developing action plans to facilitate a coordinated approach among member states. 3. Financial Support: The European Parliament can propose the allocation of funds to support projects and initiatives related to the problem at hand. This can be accomplished through grants, subsidies, or other forms of financial assistance, which can incentivize stakeholders to take actions that align with the desired outcome. 4. Encourage Cross-border Collaboration: Facilitating cooperation among member states is crucial, and the Parliament may take a proactive role in promoting partnerships and joint programs. Establishing frameworks for collaboration, sharing best practices, and providing logistical support can create optimal conditions for creating solutions that resonate with all countries involved. 5. Awareness and Education Campaigns: The European Parliament can endorse awareness-raising campaigns, educational programs, and capacity-building initiatives to inform citizens, stakeholders, and other relevant actors of the issue and engage them in solving it. Through increased awareness and understanding, more people will be motivated to participate in reversal efforts. 6. Advocacy and Diplomacy: By actively engaging with European institutions, international organizations, and third countries, the Parliament can advocate for the matter in question, thus promoting the issue on the international stage. Diplomatic efforts may contribute to creating a favorable environment for change and, in some cases, even facilitate the signing of international agreements or treaties. 7. Monitoring and Evaluation: The European Parliament can establish mechanisms to assess the progress made in reversing the development and identify any obstacles. By collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data, member states can receive feedback on whether their actions are effectively contributing to the desired outcome and make adjustments as necessary. Each of these measures may be pursued individually or combined in a multifaceted strategy to address the development in question. By working together and leveraging the power of the European Union as a unified force, the European Parliament can help drive change on the continental level, contributing to a reversal of an undesired development that affects multiple member states."},{"prompt":"OPTIONS: + Yes. + No. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does a gas mask keep out?\\" is \\"the atmosphere\\", given that a breathing mask is used for keeping air pollution from the respiratory system?

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas. (St. Mary's later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Where will Trump send the National Guard to protect the US from drug smuggling?

Dance. When someone is excited, they are experiencing a feeling of great enthusiasm and eagerness about something. When a person shows excitement, they often have an elevated emotional state that can manifest in various forms. Out of the options provided, dancing is a common and fitting way for someone to express their excitement. Dancing is a versatile form of expression that can be tailored to an individual's preference, such as the type of dance or the intensity of movements. This activity allows people to utilize their body and movements in order to communicate a range of emotions, such as joy, happiness, or anticipation. Dancing is a universal language that is culturally diverse, making it a great option for people of all backgrounds to showcase their excitement. Besides dancing, people can also show excitement in other ways, including but not limited to: - Smiling or laughing: A person may smile or laugh when they're excited, as a way to express their happy emotions. - Clapping: Clapping is often a sign of enthusiasm and appreciation for a good performance and can show excitement about an upcoming event. - Jumping or skipping: A person might jump or skip in joy, especially when they are ecstatic about a specific occurrence. - Screaming or shouting: Some people might scream or shout in excitement when something extraordinary happens, for example, when their favorite team scores a goal or they get surprised by good news. Although option D (dance) is the most suitable answer in this context, people can and do show excitement in many other ways.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: not not really interested no Here is a hypothesis: I am totally interested. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"The claim you are making about being able to draw a conclusion from the premise to the hypothesis rests on the ability to logically connect the premise (not not really interested no) to the hypothesis (I am totally interested). In making such a claim, we need to consider quantities, qualities, relations, and modality of statements. However, the premise is a bit ambiguous or unclear. The phrase \\"not not really interested no\\" can be seen as a double negative phrase. In English, a double negative forms a positive statement. Therefore, \\"not not really interested no\\" could be interpreted as \\"I am really interested.\\" Nevertheless, the use of the word \\"no\\" at the end complicates the interpretation as it typically negates a statement. If we take \\"no\\" as a negation, the phrase doesn't convey a clear sense. For instance, it could also mean \\"I am not really interested\\" if we imagine the speaker inserting the word \\"I'm\\" at the beginning and interpreting \\"no\\" as an affirmation of that negative stance. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"I am totally interested\\" is more assertive and stronger than probably expressing interest, it is stating a definite interest in the subject, not just some half-hearted or somewhat interest. Thus, given the vagueness of the premise, it's quite complex to draw a direct conclusion to the explicit and positive hypothesis of \\"I am totally interested.\\" If the premise is \\"not not really interested no\\" interpreted as \\"I am really interested\\", it doesn't necessarily mean that the hypothesis \\"I am totally interested\\" is true, they do not share the same intensity of interest. A person could be really interested in something, but not totally interested, as total interest generally means complete or full interest with no room for anything else. If the premise \\"not not really interested no\\" is interpreted as \\"I am not really interested\\", the hypothesis \\"I am totally interested\\" would indeed contradict this. So, based on the vagueness of the premise, it's not possible to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. The vague structure and potential double negatives in the premise make it challenging to discern a clear meaning and make any accurate assumption or assertions about a correlation to the hypothesis \\"I am totally interested.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A recent case involving the historic abuse of 26 children at a Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire more than 40 years ago serves as a somber reminder that even institutions with the noblest of intentions can become the setting for horrific acts. Two men have since come forward to profess their innocence, and, as the legal process unfolds, we must confront the specter of unimaginable cruelty and explore the broader implications of this deeply troubling case. The Allegations: A Wretched Saga Unfolds The accused individuals have been charged with multiple counts of physical and sexual abuse against 26 boys who resided at the now-defunct Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire. The alleged incidents occurred between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, a period during which the accused men were employed at the institution. Prosecutors maintain that these two individuals orchestrated a prolonged campaign of abuse, targeting vulnerable youngsters who, in many cases, had nowhere else to go. The alleged victims' testimonies mirror the harrowing accounts often heard in abuse trials — stories of fear, intimidation, pain, and an appalling breach of trust. These young boys, many of them already scarred by the circumstances that brought them to the Bedfordshire home, were reportedly subjected to further mistreatment at the hands of the very people charged with their care. Although the accused have fervently denied these allegations, the trial is certain to cast a long and distressing shadow over the lives of those involved, raising questions about the failure to protect these children and the enduring impact of such abuse. The Broader Context: Historical Abuse in Religious Institutions While the Bedfordshire case may appear as an isolated tragedy, it exists within a broader context of historical abuse within religious institutions, particularly in the Catholic Church. Over the past few decades, several high-profile cases have emerged involving abusive priests and cover-ups by the Church hierarchy, prompting deep-seated introspection, soul-searching, and reform efforts at both the local and international levels. The legacy of this systemic abuse has shattered trust in religious institutions. It has thrown into sharp relief the Church's responsibility to those entrusted to its care, painting a deeply troubling picture of institutional hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy. Moving Forward: Seeking Justice and Healing As the trial continues, the pursuit of justice for the 26 victims is paramount. This includes ensuring that those responsible for these heinous acts, if proven guilty, are held to account. However, justice will not be truly served unless we also address the underlying factors that allowed these abuses to continue unchecked. First and foremost, this means fostering a climate of transparency and accountability within religious institutions. It also means engaging in thorough introspection, examining how the culture of silence and cover-ups enabled abuse over extended periods, and taking steps to ensure that such horrors are never allowed to fester in the shadows again. Victims, too, must be afforded the opportunity to heal, a process that may entail confronting the darkest chapters of their past. Psychological support and sympathy in their journey towards wholeness should be continuously provided. Conclusion The historic child abuse case at the Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire forces us to face the reality of unchecked power dynamics in trusted institutions. By acknowledging the damage done and committing to transparency, we can ensure that these deplorable acts are relegated to the past, never to be repeated. In doing so, we give a voice to those who have suffered and ensure that their pain serves as a catalyst to create a society that safeguards the vulnerable and holds those who hurt them to account."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - Coal is mined out of the ground - Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin - Electricity is produced. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal delivered happens, how will it affect MORE heat for the house. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In the process you provided, coal combustion is utilized to generate electricity, which may indirectly be used for heating a house. When there's less coal delivered, it can have several direct and indirect consequences impacting the heat for the house. Directly, less coal available for burning means the coal and hot air mixture in the boiler chamber would produce a smaller or less intense fire. It results in the generation of a lower amount of heat, which directly affects the amount of steam produced. Indirectly, when the coal is reduced, the water pumped through pipes in the boiler will not be heated as efficiently, leading to a decrease in steam production. Lower steam production means the turbines spin less or at a slower rate, implying a reduction in the overall electricity production. As a result of these direct and indirect effects, the perturbation of less coal delivery would lead to reduced electricity generation. If the house relies on electric heating, this could potentially lead to less heat being available for the house. However, it's important to note that electricity is often distributed through a grid network, meaning that the impact of less coal delivered to a single power plant might not cause a significant decrease in electricity available for heating a particular house. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less coal delivery could have an indirect effect on the heating produced for the house if the house relies on electric heating. This effect, however, may not be substantial due to the way electricity is distributed in a grid network."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Math Problem Solve -85*z = -60 + 145 for z.","completion":"To solve for z in the equation -85*z = -60 + 145, you first need to simplify the right side of the equation. On the right side of the equation, we have -60 + 145, which simplifies to 85. So, the equation now reads -85*z = 85. Now to isolate variable z, we will divide each side of the equation by -85. On the left side, -85*z divided by -85 is just z. On the right side, 85 divided by -85 is -1. So, your equation simplifies to: z = -1 It's crucial to follow these steps when you are isolating a single variable by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation, thus maintaining the equation's equality. This specific operation was division, which is a form of inverse operation since it undoes multiplication. You used division by -85 because -85 was originally multiplied to z. Remember that dividing by a negative number means the sign of the resulting fraction is negative. Therefore, the solution to the equation -85*z = -60 + 145 is z = -1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

They have one common goal: to retire rich and free from their criminal lives. They learn about a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to steal a large sum of money from a well-guarded but vulnerable establishment. Step 2: Introduce the target The gang discovers that a renowned casino, owned by a ruthless mobster, is hosting a high-stakes poker tournament, which will have over a million dollars in cash on site; this is the perfect opportunity for the gang to make their move. Step 3: The planning phase As the gang gathers information about the casino's security, layout, and operational details, they meticulously plan the heist. Each member of the team is given a specific role, ensuring their skills are optimized for the operation. They also recruit a local hacker/public records expert to assist them in their prep work. The gang trains and rehearsals the heist, investing in necessary high-tech tools and equipment. Step 4: The execution On the night of the poker tournament, the gang infiltrates the casino using various disguises and diversion tactics. The operation is divided into three stages: creating a distraction, neutralizing the security, and extracting the money. Step 5: The twist and escalation After successfully executing the first two stages, the gang encounters an obstacle in the form of a casino employee, who has connections to the mob boss.

A:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to identify the missing first step in the process describing how oxygen enters the body and ultimately reaches the cells. The current first step mentioned is: \\"The lungs remove oxygen from the air.\\" We need to find the step that precedes this. Step-by-step thinking: 1. Oxygen is present in the air. 2. To get this oxygen into the lungs, the body needs to perform a specific action. 3. The missing step is the action that brings the oxygen in the air into the lungs. Justification of the missing step: Before the lungs can remove oxygen from the air, the body needs to inhale the air. During inhalation, the diaphragm and other muscles in the chest cavity contract, leading to the expansion of the chest cavity and a decrease in pressure. This draws air, which contains oxygen, into the lungs through the nose and/or mouth. This action is crucial for the process, as it brings the oxygen in the air into close proximity with the alveoli, where it will be absorbed into the bloodstream.

However, the sentence is not entirely devoid of meaning, and we can understand that the authorities are blaming Greenpeace for the bombing. Therefore, I will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the linguistic integrity of the sentence as follows. First, let us break down the original sentence into its constituent parts: Subject: The authorities Verb: blamed Object: Greenpeace Prepositional phrase: with the bombing (incorrect usage) To improve the linguistic integrity of this sentence, the preposition \\"with\\" should be replaced by \\"for.\\" The grammatically correct and more indicative sentence is: \\"The authorities blamed Greenpeace for the bombing.\\" Subject: The authorities Verb: blamed Object: Greenpeace Prepositional phrase: for the bombing (correct usage) By replacing \\"with\\" by \\"for,\\" we make the sentence linguistically acceptable, as the term \\"for\\" correctly serves to attribute culpability or responsibility to Greenpeace regarding the bombing. Consequently, this change leads to better clarity and coherence, while maintaining the intended meaning of the statement. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the original sentence is unacceptable but can be easily rectified by swapping out the preposition \\"with\\" for \\"for.\\" By doing so, we make the sentence \\"The authorities blamed Greenpeace for the bombing\\" acceptable in terms of grammar, clarity, and coherence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which would lose a proton more easily, sample A or sample B? David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them. Hint: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. Answer:","completion":"Sample A would lose a proton more easily than sample B. This is because sample A is a strong acid, while sample B is a weak acid. The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton (H+). A strong acid completely dissociates in water, meaning one mole of the strong acid (HA) dissolves in water, yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base (A−), and none of the protonated acid (HA) remains. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates, and both the acid and the conjugate base are present in solution at equilibrium. Since strong acids have a higher tendency to lose a proton compared to weak acids, sample A, being a strong acid, will lose a proton more easily than sample B, which is a weak acid. The ease of deprotonation can be attributed to factors such as the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, determining the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths can also be discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base, where a more stable conjugate base makes it easier for the acid to lose a proton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"No, \\"go to college\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What does Casey need to do before this?\\". The context of the provided situation suggests that Casey is waiting to hear from college admissions regarding their acceptance or non-acceptance. The specific actions they took before receiving and opening the envelope involve the following steps: 1. Researching colleges: It all starts with finding the right college or university that best suits their interests, goals, and aspirations. Casey must have researched and explored different colleges to learn about their programs, campus size, and other factors before making a decision. 2. Preparing for and taking college entrance exams: In many cases, students need to take standardized tests like the SAT or ACT, among others. Casey must have prepared for these tests, registered, and taken them in a timely manner to submit their scores as part of the admission application. 3. Gathering required documentation: Casey would need to gather and organize all the necessary documents, such as their high school transcript, letters of recommendation, and other relevant records to have the required information for completing the application. 4. Writing a personal statement or essay: Many colleges ask applicants to submit a personal statement or essay as part of the admissions process. Casey would have spent time reflecting on their experiences, goals, and aspirations, and then writing a compelling essay. 5. Submitting the college application: After all the preparation, Casey would have filled out the application online or on paper, and submitted it to the college or university before the application deadline. This would include attaching all required documents and paying an application fee, if applicable. 6.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the original name of the person whose early work was published primarily in magazines? is inside the article: André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period., can you guess it ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? James Whale (22 July 1889 - 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theater director and actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. After the armistice he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the Bystander in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, \\"stage director\\" (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale's living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off. In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancee. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of Beau Geste. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \\"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\\". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years. With the success of Journey's End at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I.","completion":"This text is about James Whale, an English film director, theater director, and actor.

Husband and wife Rawdon and Miranda are soulmates. Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey. Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel. Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents and Uncle Jack – firmly in Quincey's life. Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life.

Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate for the child in whom Lama Dorje is reborn: an American boy named Jesse Conrad, the young son of an architect and a teacher who live in Seattle. The monks come to Seattle in order to meet the boy. Jesse is fascinated with the monks and their way of life, but his parents, Dean and Lisa, are wary, and that wariness turns into near-hostility when Norbu announces that he wants to take Jesse back with him to Bhutan to be tested. Dean changes his mind however, when one of his close friends and colleagues commits suicide because he went broke. Dean then decides to travel to Bhutan with Jesse. In Nepal, two children who are also candidates for the rebirth are encountered, Raju and Gita. Gradually, over the course of the movie, first Jesse's mother and then Lama Norbu tell the life story of Prince Siddhartha, reading from a book that Lama Norbu has given to Jesse. In ancient Nepal, a prince called Siddhartha turns his back on his comfortable and protected life, and sets out on a journey to solve the problem of universal suffering. As he progresses, he learns profound truths about the nature of life, consciousness, and reality. Ultimately, he battles Mara (a demon representing the ego), who repeatedly tries to divert and destroy Siddhartha. Through the final complete realization of the illusory nature of his own ego, Siddhartha attains enlightenment and becomes the Buddha.

Hoddle's expertise in developing and nurturing talent has been an invaluable resource for the club and specifically for Taarabt, who is known for his remarkable dribbling skills. Through focused coaching and support from Hoddle, Taarabt is expected to make a strong comeback and become an influential figure within the team. Step 3: Explain the importance of employing a nutritionist to improve Taarabt's diet. In addition to providing top-quality coaching, QPR is also committed to ensuring that Taarabt achieves optimal physical fitness. Tony Fernandes has revealed his plans to employ a nutritionist to improve the Moroccan midfielder's diet, helping him reach peak performance levels both in matches and during training. Establishing a balanced diet and customized nutritional plan will support Taarabt in maintaining good health, increasing stamina, and, ultimately, boosting his overall performance on the pitch. Step 4: Wrap up the article by reiterating the potential benefits and expectations for Taarabt. By combining Glenn Hoddle's coaching expertise with a focus on nutrition and physical fitness, QPR's management firmly believes that Adel Taarabt has all the tools to enhance his abilities and make a significant impact for the team. A rejuvenated Taarabt may prove to be a game-changer in crucial matches for QPR, as they seek to solidify their position as a top-tier team in English football. The dedicated efforts of Tony Fernandes and the QPR management to get the best out of Taarabt would certainly be a testament to their commitment to nurturing talent and helping players reach their full potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: John suffered from mental illness, but he was in good hands. He would have to be on drugs for the rest of his life, but they allowed it to be what? Possible A: free, cause hallucination, recur, effectively treated, managed Why is \\"effectively treated\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Effectively treated\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of John's mental illness because it indicates that his condition is being addressed and managed appropriately with the use of prescribed medication. This implies that, while John may have to take drugs for the rest of his life, the therapy is proving successful in controlling his symptoms and maintaining his mental health. Human common sense dictates that, when faced with a long-term health condition such as mental illness, the aim is to treat it as effectively as possible to promote stability, recovery, and a good quality of life. Let's examine the other possible answers and understand why \\"effectively treated\\" is more aligned with human common sense: 1. Free - This answer may suggest that John doesn't have to pay for his medication or that his mental illness may somehow be entirely gone. However, it doesn't clarify how his condition is being managed or positively affected by the drugs. Hence, it does not provide a clear understanding of his situation when compared to the term \\"effectively treated.\\" 2. Cause hallucination - This option implies that the drugs John is taking result in hallucinations, which would not be aligned with the context of being \\"in good hands.\\" Hallucinations typically represent an adverse side effect of medication, suggesting that the drugs are causing further problems rather than helping John to manage his mental illness. Thus, this answer is not aligned with human common sense for a positive outcome. 3. Recur - This option indicates that John's mental illness would repeatedly emerge in his life. Although recurrence might be a reality for many individuals living with mental health conditions, the statement that \\"he was in good hands\\" seems to contradict this potentially negative outcome. Human common sense would argue that being \\"in good hands\\" would lead to a more stable and managed condition, which is why \\"effectively treated\\" is a more appropriate response. 4. Managed - Although this answer closely aligns with human common sense, it slightly falls short when compared to \\"effectively treated.\\" The term \\"managed\\" suggests that the condition is being addressed but doesn't necessarily imply that the treatment is successful in reducing symptoms or significantly improving John's quality of life. In comparison, \\"effectively treated\\" explicitly confirms that the treatment plan has proven advantageous in controlling and mitigating John's mental illness symptoms. In summary, the answer \\"effectively treated\\" is aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the idea of successful management and control of John's mental illness through the use of prescription drugs. It offers a more positive and clear understanding of his circumstance and reflects best practice when it comes to treating mental health conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here, so don't expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have it's moment, \\"Postal\\" wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through. At its core, Postal is a satire on the United States, as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself, and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else. After the initial surprise wears off, Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity. This probably would have worked as a short movie, but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long).

Step 1: Analyzing the premise The premise is: \\"And that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not.\\" First, we can remove the conjunction \\"And\\" to focus on the core statement: \\"That was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not.\\" In this statement, we understand that something (that) has confirmed the suspicion of the speaker, and the suspicion is about the negation of a particular situation (it was not). Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis is: \\"It was confirmed that it was not.\\" This statement suggests that there is confirmation of the same negation mentioned in the premise (it was not). Step 3: Comparing the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis are talking about the confirmation of the same negation (it was not). The key difference is that the premise refers to a specific instance (that) which confirmed the speaker's suspicion, whereas the hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention the instance or the speaker's suspicion. Step 4: Evaluating entailment Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement logically guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, if the premise is true, it essentially means that something confirmed the speaker's suspicion about the negation. Since the hypothesis also refers to a confirmation of the same negation, it can be concluded that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.

In World War II, how was the Japanese aircraft, the Mitsubishi A6M known to the Allies? What is the answer?","completion":"To find the answer, I will search for information on the Mitsubishi A6M aircraft and its designation by the Allies during World War II. Step 1: Gather information about the Mitsubishi A6M The Mitsubishi A6M is a Japanese long-range naval fighter aircraft that was in service from 1940 to 1945. It was designed by Jiro Horikoshi and produced by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. It was primarily used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during World War II. Step 2: Determine how the Allies referred to the Mitsubishi A6M The Allies used code names to identify various Japanese aircraft during World War II. Fighter planes were often assigned male names while bombers and reconnaissance aircraft were assigned female names. To find out the specific code name for the Mitsubishi A6M, I need to search for references to it from the Allies' perspective. Step 3: Identify the Allied code name for the Mitsubishi A6M Upon researching, I found that the Allies referred to the Mitsubishi A6M as the \\"Zero.\\" This code name is attributed to the fact that the aircraft entered service in the Japanese Imperial Year 2600, which corresponds to 1940 in the Gregorian calendar.

How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

More than 2,000 referees - the majority at grassroots level - responded to questions about the abuse they receive and how well the Football Association's Respect programme is working. Nearly one in five said they had experienced physical abuse. \\"There is no room for complacency and we remain vigilant,\\" said the FA. It told the BBC: \\"More extreme incidents such as referee assaults thankfully remain few and far between. \\"Across an estimated 1.2 million games last season the number of reported incidents amounted to a tiny fraction of 1% - which puts the scale of the problem into context.\\" But Dr Jamie Cleland from the University of Loughborough, one of the academics involved in the research, warned: \\"These findings are quite concerning for the FA because without referees the grassroots game would not exist. \\"Referees are the bedrock of the amateur game because you need a referee to turn up in order for the match to go ahead and so these are a warning sign for the FA.\\" Case study: 'He threatened to kill me' The 5 live Investigates programme has been given exclusive access to the research, which was carried out by academics at Loughborough, Portsmouth and Edge Hill universities. A total of 2,026 referees across England, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey responded to the survey. Thirty-two percent are currently at Level 7 - junior referees aged 16 or over. The second biggest response, 30%, was from those at Level 5 - senior county referees. The survey also included a small number of responses from referees within the Football and Premier Leagues. Findings reveal that 22% experience verbal abuse at every match, while 38% said they were abused every couple of games. In addition, 19% had been the victim of physical abuse at some time. Donald Distin from Devon, who has been a referee for 15 years, was attacked by a player as he showed a red card during a game last year. \\"He just punched me. My feet left the ground and I was on the floor,\\" Mr Distin told the programme. \\"The bruising went all the way down through my chest and my face. My eye was bloodshot - it was horrific. I couldn't see my grandson because he was so upset.\\" The player was subsequently jailed over the attack. Mr Distin told the programme he still experiences abuse at matches. \\"I did a game the other day - it was a local derby and there were 10 cautions and two sending-offs. I sent someone off the field of play and he came towards me and said 'I'm going to kill you', as well as a load of expletives.\\" During the 2014-15 season there were 100 assaults on match officials and 374 incidents of improper conduct including physical contact and threatening and/or abusive language. Officials were also asked about the FA's Respect Programme which began seven years ago to improve behaviour among players and spectators. More than half, 54%, said the campaign had been successful. Comments included: \\"Respect levels, in general, have been very good from my experience. The knowledge of the Respect campaign has been good at most clubs.\\" Another said: \\"I referee adult football and there has been a marked improvement in behaviour. There are fewer incidents of irrational behaviour.\\" But nearly a third felt that the campaign had been unsuccessful. \\"What we've seen from within the data is a real outpouring of emotion from referees. They are saying that the campaign has been somewhat successful but they are then providing a diary-like analysis of the experiences that they are receiving if not at every match, every couple of matches,\\" added Dr Cleland. One official told the survey: \\"Behaviour of players and coaches has not improved in the slightest and all this shaking of hands pre-match is meaningless, totally meaningless.\\" Another added: \\"At the level I referee, I don't believe the Respect campaign has made much of a difference. The behaviour of players and spectators, shouting, swearing etc, if anything has got worse since I started refereeing.\\" An FA spokesperson told 5 live Investigates that \\"incidents of dissent are never pleasant and the notion that they are in any way part and parcel of the game is one that the Respect Programme was established to dispel\\". The spokesperson highlighted a 23% decline in dissent cautions over the past seven seasons and added: \\"With a significant drop in the occurrence of this type of caution over the life of the programme, it is clearly working.\\" But they also conceded that one serious assault is one too many. \\"The FA engages directly with referees through its own research and gave its support to the independent study which - when drilled down - indicates that only 7% of referees feel that Respect isn't working outright.\\"","completion":"A survey of over 2,000 football referees, mainly at grassroots level, revealed that nearly one in five had experienced physical abuse, and 32% and 38% reported experiencing verbal abuse in every game or every few games respectively, raising concerns for the future of amateur football and suggesting that the Football Association's Respect programme may not be as effective as desired."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, all the \\"y\\"s are like buckets. We have 289 buckets, 205 buckets, and -95 buckets. But when we put them all together, we find that they equal 4389 toys. Now, you're probably thinking, \\"Why is the last bucket -95?\\" That's because it’s like having a hole in our toy box and we're losing 95 toys. So, we don't really have -95 toys. We just have 95 less toys than we had before. So, we want to combine our buckets together first before we find out how many toys each bucket should hold to have a total of 4389 toys. We have 289 buckets plus 205 buckets gives us 494 buckets. But remember our hole? We have to take away 95 buckets. So 494 buckets take away 95 buckets gives us 399 buckets in total. Our equation now becomes 4389 toys = 399 buckets * y. That means, we need to split 4389 toys into 399 buckets so each bucket has the same amount of toys. To find out how many toys are in each bucket, we divide the total toys (4389) by the total buckets (399). When we do this, we find that each bucket holds about 11 toys.

(April 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story focuses on a British photographer, John Bradley, who is sent into the Thai rain forest to take wildlife photographs. While on assignment, a tribe native to the area takes him captive. Bradley starts in Bangkok, taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a boxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self-defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene. The next day, John begins his trip deep into the rain forest. He rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. John agrees to head back after one more day of traveling. John falls asleep, and when he awakes, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, LuhanÃ , is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks.

Croker breaks back into his former prison to convince Mr. Bridger (NoÃ«l Coward), the head of a huge criminal empire, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns Fiat is set to build a new factory in China. With Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach (Benny Hill), his girlfriend Lorna (Maggie Blye) and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer controlling Turin's traffic control system, creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three Mini Cooper S getaway cars.[7] After planning and training, Croker and crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani (Raf Vallone) and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann.

US tattoo artist offering free 'Trump stamps' for Donald Trump supporters A tattoo artist in New Hampshire has decided to show his support for presidential cadidate Donald Trump by offering free Trump tattoos. (Instagram: @bobstattoo) A tattoo artist in New Hampshire has shown his support for presidential candidate Donald Trump by putting his money where his mouth is, offering to ink free “Trump stamps” on fellow supporters. Owner of The Clay Dragon Tattoo Parlor and Bob’s Tattoo Studio in Seabrook, Bob Holmes first announced the offer last week as a cheeky twist on the common “tramp stamp”. He has already had 27 customers sign up, he told ABC News. So far customers have mostly requested a tattoo of Trump’s motto, “Make America great again”, but a few have also requested his portrait. The cost of the tattoos range from 125 (A173) to 200 (A277), so the teams at both parlours have already pledged thousands of dollars to Trump’s presidency campaign. Most Trump supporters are requesting the candidate's slogan \\"Make America great again\\". (Facebook) Mr Holmes said he decided to offer the tats after he was asked during an interview if he had tattooed “The Donald” onto a client yet, to which he replied he’d happily “do it for free”. He admitted only one of the parlour’s employees wasn’t a Trump supporter, but was inking the tattoos in support of the business. A tattoo artist in Vermont has responded by offering free Bernie Sanders tattoos. (Facebook) In the next state over, a Vermont parlour, Aartistic Inc, is now offering free Bernie Sanders ink.

When asked to comment on the video allegations the communications minister told the BBC that he had not seen it. The detainees are believed to have gone on hunger strike to protest against their degrading treatment. In recent months there have been increased tensions in the English-speaking regions of the country following protests and strikes against marginalisation by the majority Francophone government. Mr Ndangoh, a former deputy mayor for the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) party, says in the video that the captives were abducted six months ago and have been held at various hidden cells in appalling conditions. It is not known what the individuals are being charged with. But Mr Ndangoh was accused by police in July of helping a radical Anglophone member of parliament to escape. Mr Ndangoh goes on to say that they are currently being held in a bunker at the \\"gendarmerie [military police] headquarters ,\\" in the capital Yaounde. \\"If dying is the price we must pay to guarantee our freedom and re-establish the independence of our country, then it is a price worth paying.\\" he says.

Parents of some of those detained told the BBC's Randy Joe Sa'ah that they did not know where their sons had disappeared to until they saw the video.

Muhammad Ali (; born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and activist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring. Cassius Clay was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old. Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. () was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He had a sister and four brothers. He was named for his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912-1990), who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist, Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with smaller amounts of Irish and English heritage. His father painted billboards and signs, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917-1994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali) as Baptists. Cassius Jr. attended Central High School in Louisville. Clay grew up amid racial segregation. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store--\\"They wouldn't give him one because of his color. That really affected him.\\" He was also affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, which led to young Clay and a friend's taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard. Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to \\"whup\\" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \\"real training\\", eventually moulding \\"my style, my stamina and my system\\". For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak. Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend were refused service at a \\"whites-only\\" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard Bingham, denied it. Brown told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, \\"Honkies sure bought into that one!\\" Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it. Ali received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games.

As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject. Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets: Core, Non-core, and Under Review. Core: Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core: Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS). Enron has approx. 8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns. Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion. An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets. Under Review: EGM, EIM. These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability. Required resource levels are being carefully studied. Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates. Approximately 800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets. Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of 500MM-1Bn. Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the 3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the 1Bn of new debt, and the 1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy. Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity. Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets. It was initially capitalized with 950MM of 144a debt and 125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors). The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets. Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation). The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies. The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water. As long as Wessex is worth at least 2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required. If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide 650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt. This 650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances. Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'. It was initially capitalized with 2.4Bn of 144a debt and 220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals). As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) 1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup. Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. 600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity. The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.

How can I get a Reliance Jio sim for Nexus 5? To get a Reliance Jio sim for Nexus 5, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Check Compatibility Nexus 5 is a device that supports 4G LTE networks, so it is compatible with the Reliance Jio network. However, Nexus 5 supports only Band 3 and 7, while Jio uses Band 5, 3, and 40. Even though Nexus 5 may not support all the bands, you can still use Jio SIM for voice and data services. Step 2: Gather Required Documents You will need valid Proof of Identity (POI) and Proof of Address (POA) documents to get a Jio SIM card. Examples of documents that are accepted include: - Aadhaar Card - Voter ID Card - Passport - Driving License Step 3: Visit Reliance Jio Store or Retailer Visit the nearest Reliance Digital, Reliance DX Mini Store, or an authorized retailer to apply for a Jio SIM card. Carry a photocopy of your POI and POA documents, as well as a passport-size photograph. Step 4: Fill out the Customer Acquisition Form (CAF) At the store, you will be required to fill out a Customer Acquisition Form (CAF). Provide all the required information and attach the necessary documents. Step 5: Complete the eKYC Process Reliance Jio uses the Aadhaar-based eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) process for instant SIM card activation. You will need to provide your Aadhaar number and your fingerprint for biometric authentication. In case Aadhaar-based eKYC is not available, you can submit a physical copy of your POI and POA documents. Step 6: Receive the Jio SIM Card Once your documentation and eKYC process are successful, you will be given a Jio SIM card. It may take up to 1-2 hours for the SIM card to get activated. Step 7: Insert the Jio SIM Card in your Nexus 5 Insert the Jio SIM card into the SIM slot of your Nexus 5 smartphone. Configure the APN settings and reboot your phone to start using Jio services. 2. How can I get a Reliance Jio SIM Card?

The term \\"place\\" has multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In these sentences, \\"place\\" is being utilized to portray two separate concepts. 1. In the sentence, \\"He comes from a place near Chicago,\\" the word \\"place\\" refers to a specific location, area, or region geographically situated near Chicago. In this context, it denotes a physical setting where someone resides or has a connection with, such as a town, city, or village. This usage highlights the attribute of \\"place\\" as a noun signifying a locality where certain events, actions, or processes occur. 2. Conversely, in the sentence, \\"He lost his place on the page,\\" the word \\"place\\" does not refer to a geographical location but rather signifies a position or location in a sequence or among a series of items, such as words, lines, or paragraphs. In this instance, \\"place\\" functions as a metaphorical representation of a point within a specific linear arrangement, which may be on a written page, a computer screen, or any other medium where information is organized sequentially. \\"Place\\" in this context emphasizes the idea of order or arrangement in a more abstract sense rather than a concrete, physical locality. In summary, the word \\"place\\" has different meanings in the two sentences provided. The first sentence utilizes \\"place\\" to designate a geographical location or setting, while the second sentence refers to the position or order of elements in a sequence.

Article: Two new studies suggest that modern running shoes could increase the risk of injuries to runners. One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,... Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Walking in high heels could cause less serious effects than running barefoot. B: Two new discoveries encourage people to run in high heels. C: Running in shoes is partly good to runners.

Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.).

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - O.S.S. is a 1946 war film starring Alan Ladd and Geraldine Fitzgerald about the Office of Strategic Services , directed by Irving Pichel , who would soon be blacklisted and written by Richard Maibaum , a World War Two vet who would later write 12 of the first 15 James Bond films .

Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. - Veronica Lake (born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman; November 14, 1922 July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress.

What's the answer?","completion":"Fruits are made on plants through a complex process involving pollination, fertilization, and growth. The production of fruit occurs on various plants, including trees, shrubs, and vines, which belong to the kingdom Plantae. The process can be broken down into several stages that lead to the creation and maturation of these edible and nutritious structures. 1. Flower formation: The initial step in fruit production is the formation of flowers. Flowers are reproductive structures that contain the necessary organs for sexual reproduction in plants. They typically consist of four main parts: petals, sepals, stamens, and carpels. The stamens produce pollen which contains the male reproductive cells or sperm cells, while the carpels, specifically the ovary, house the female reproductive cells or egg cells. 2. Pollination: For a plant to produce fruit, pollen from the male part of a flower (stamen) needs to be transferred to the female part of a flower (the stigma of the carpel) of the same or a compatible plant species. This process can be facilitated by various pollination methods, such as wind, animals (insects, birds, and mammals), and water. Some plants can self-pollinate, while others rely on cross-pollination between different individual plants for genetic diversity. 3. Fertilization: Once the pollen reaches the stigma of the carpel, it germinates and forms a pollen tube, which extends down the style and into the ovary. Inside the pollen tube, sperm cells are transported to the ovary, where they merge with an egg cell during a process called fertilization. This leads to the formation of a zygote, which develops into an embryo within a seed. 4. Fruit development: After fertilization, the ovary within the flower begins to grow and develop into a fruit. This is called fruit set. The process of fruit development varies depending on the plant species and the type of fruit being formed. Simple fruits, such as apples and cherries, develop from a single ovary, whereas aggregate fruits, like raspberries and blackberries, are made up of multiple ovaries from a single flower. Fruits like pineapples and figs are called multiple fruits because they develop from several flowers fused together. 5. Fruit maturation: As the fruit continues to develop, it goes through changes in size, color, texture, aroma, and taste. These changes occur as nutrients, such as sugars and acids, accumulate within the fruit, and they are essential for attracting animals that will consume the fruit and disperse its seeds. Some fruits ripen on the plant, while others continue the ripening process after they are picked. In summary, fruits are made on plants through various stages, including flower formation, pollination, fertilization, fruit development, and maturation. The production of these nutritious and diverse structures is essential not only for the reproduction and dispersal strategies of plants but also for the consumption and sustenance of various organisms, including humans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Games in the Battlefront series normally revolve around two armies -- the Galactic Republic versus the Confederacy of Independent Systems or the Galactic Empire versus the Rebel Alliance or First Order versus the Resistance -- fighting each other on various maps. Maps take place in the Star Wars galaxy, with battlezones varying in theme and size. Across the battlefield are multiple \`\`command posts'' (objectives) that act as spawn points, and can be controlled by either the player or the computer. Units can spawn from any friendly command post, and vehicles regularly spawn at their respective command posts when destroyed. Units can capture neutral or hostile command posts by approaching them and standing within the immediate vicinity for about 30 seconds. The time to capture quickens with more friendly units within the capture zone. Some vehicles act as mobile command posts, and must be destroyed as they can not be captured.

(CNN) -- Ghassan Hitto once held court as an information technology manager in a safe Texas office. Now he's halfway across the world, in charge of a corner of hell. Hitto is the new head of the Syrian opposition's interim government. He'll use his ample and savvy management experience -- honed by his years as an executive in the IT field in Dallas and his activist work for his native Syria and Muslims -- to administer the large swaths of territory seized by rebels from the Bashar al-Assad government during the raging civil war. People who've worked with Hitto are proud of his achievement and say he'll do well. He is hoping that OPTIONS: - Bashar al-Assad's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - CNN's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Dallas's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Ghassan Hitto's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Hitto's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Muslim Brotherhood's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Muslims's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Syria's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Syrian's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Syrians's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - Texas's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. - U.S.'s American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States.","completion":"Ghassan Hitto's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. As the new head of the Syrian opposition's interim government, Hitto's background and connections to the United States could prove beneficial in forging stronger ties between the two countries. This connection may help facilitate more open channels of communication, as well as foster cooperation on various levels. Hitto's experience in the United States is not only limited to his time as an information technology manager in Texas; he has also been actively involved in activism for his native Syria and for Muslim communities. This blend of professional and personal involvement with the U.S. and Syria could help him better understand and navigate the complex relationships and interests at play when seeking support and collaboration from the United States. His American citizenship and connections to the U.S. could make him a more relatable and trusted figure to American officials and policymakers, paving the way for more productive and beneficial dialogue between the opposition forces and the U.S. government. Moreover, his appointment may be seen as a positive development by the American public, as it might demonstrate that the Syrian opposition is diverse and includes individuals who share some common ground with the U.S. Furthermore, a closer relationship between the Syrian opposition and the United States could have a range of implications and potential benefits. It could lead to increased American involvement in providing humanitarian aid or technical assistance, sharing intelligence on terrorist groups linked to the conflict, and participating in negotiations towards a political resolution to the ongoing civil war. The U.S. may also be more inclined to provide direct support to the Syrian opposition in terms of training, resources, or financial assistance if they perceive Hitto as someone with shared values and experience. Ultimately, Ghassan Hitto's American citizenship and his background in the United States have the potential to improve the relationship between the Syrian opposition and the United States, which in turn could lead to more fruitful cooperation and support on various levels. While it is not the sole factor determining the success of this potential partnership, it is a significant aspect that should not be overlooked as the opposition seeks to secure increased support and cooperation against the Bashar al-Assad government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Traffic Deaths In 2015 Climb By Largest Increase In Decades Enlarge this image toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP Gerald Herbert/AP Newly released government data paint a sobering picture of safety on the nation's roads and highways. The number of people who died in auto accidents reached 35,092 last year, according to newly released figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That's a 7.2 percent increase over 2014. The last time there was such a large single-year increase was back in 1966, when Lyndon Johnson was president. \\"Despite decades of safety improvements, far too many people are killed on our nation's roads every year,\\" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a press release announcing the new data. \\"Solving this problem will take teamwork, so we're issuing a call to action and asking researchers, safety experts, data scientists, and the public to analyze the fatality data and help find ways to prevent these tragedies.\\" Foxx's \\"call to action\\" to researchers also was announced in a separate statement. Officials say the number of traffic fatalities was actually 25 percent higher a decade ago, when 42,708 people died on the road. But the number of deaths had been declining because of increased use of seat belts, fewer drunken drivers, and vehicle improvements such as air bags and electronic stability control. Officials say the increase last year can be attributed to more people driving. Job growth and lower fuel prices factor in, and motorists are covering more ground. \\"In 2015, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) increased 3.5 percent over 2014, the largest increase in nearly 25 years,\\" according to NHTSA. More people on the road mean more fatalities among pedestrians and cyclists. Motorcycle deaths were up more than 8 percent. Officials cite three main causes for the increase in traffic fatalities: ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Government officials say traffic fatalities rose 7.2 percent in 2015 compared to the previous year. That's the largest single-year increase in a half century. The final tally of 35,092 deaths released Monday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is 0.5 percent lower than the 7.7 percent estimated increase released in July. NHTSA said the final numbers are still the largest single-year increase since 1966. Officials attribute the rise to more drivers on the road. The Obama administration responded to the latest numbers with a \\"call to action,\\" asking researchers, safety experts, data scientists and others to find new ways to prevent traffic deaths. The National Safety Council has said that its preliminary estimates for the first six months of 2016 show the trend increasing, with fatalities up 9 percent. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In 2015, the number of people who died in car accidents in the United States reached 35,092, which is 7.2% more than in 2014. This is the largest increase in traffic deaths in decades. The increase is due to more people driving, with more miles being traveled, which leads to more chances for accidents.

Checking the sentence constituents and structure: - The sentence subject is \\"It,\\" which acts as a placeholder for the clause that follows. - The verb is \\"is\\" which is the third-person singular form of \\"to be.\\" - The predicate in this sentence is a complex one containing an adjective \\"very difficult,\\" followed by an infinitive phrase \\"to get an idea for a book simply from an interview.\\" 2. Analyzing the syntax: - The core subject-verb-object structure is present: \\"It is [idea].\\" - The infinitive phrase \\"to get an idea for a book\\" serves as the object. - The adverb \\"simply\\" modifies the infinitive phrase. - The prepositional phrase \\"from an interview\\" provides additional information about the source of the idea. 3. Analyzing the semantics: - The meaning of the sentence is clear and logical, presenting the difficulty of deriving a book idea simply from an interview. Overall, this sentence appears to follow the conventions of English syntax, semantics, and punctuation.

The mountain belongs to the Himalayan mountain range and is specifically located in the northern part of Thailand, within the province of Chiang Mai. Doi Inthanon stands tall at 2565 meters (8,415 feet) above sea level, making it the highest point in the entire Kingdom of Thailand. It is situated in the Doi Inthanon National Park, which spans an area of 482 square kilometers (186 square miles) and is home to several endangered species like the Asiatic black bear and the green peafowl, as well as an incredible variety of flora and fauna. The name \\"Doi Inthanon\\" originates from the ancient name \\"Doi Luang\\" or \\"Doi Ang Ka,\\" which means \\"Great Mountain\\" or \\"Bird Crow's Pond.\\" However, it was later renamed in honor of the late Thai King Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who wanted to preserve the forests in the region and was passionate about the conservation of nature. Doi Inthanon National Park offers something for everyone, from outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, bird-watchers, and photographers to nature lovers. Some of the highlights that can be enjoyed in the park include: 1. Waterfalls: A trek to the park leads to several spectacular waterfalls, such as Mae Klang, Wachirathan, Siriphum, and Mae Ya. 2. Trekking Trails: Many trails provide opportunities for gentle day hikes or overnight treks, which cater to people of all ages and fitness levels. 3. Bird-watching: The park is teeming with bird species, making it a prime destination for bird-watchers, with nearly 400 recorded bird species residing there. 4. Royal Project supports local agriculture and promotes the sale of high-quality agricultural products. By visiting the project, tourists can learn about different farming methods and purchase fresh produce. 5. Twin Pagodas: The stunning Naphamethinidon and Naphaphonphumisiri pagodas were built as a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit and house sacred Buddhist relics. The breathtaking landscapes, stunning views, waterfalls, and rich biodiversity make Doi Inthanon a must-visit location in Thailand. Its high elevation also provides a unique climate, resulting in cooler and more refreshing temperatures compared to the majority of the tropical country.

Implantation signifies that an invasive procedure will be carried out to place the MMS within Marissa, which will then monitor her during the trials. This is the cause of Marissa's horror and fear, as she had initially escaped the spaceport to avoid being under their surveillance. It also raises questions about her possible non-compliance with the magistrates' decision and the potential consequences she may face if she refuses to allow the implantation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the process is:_body cells absorb glucose and use it for energy_ Step 1: Sugar enters the body - After consuming a meal containing carbohydrates, the sugar (glucose) enters the body through the digestive system and is absorbed into the bloodstream. Step 2: Bloodstream - The glucose in the bloodstream will circulate and travels to different parts of the body, increasing the blood sugar levels. Step 3: The pancreas - In response to the increased blood sugar levels, the pancreas produces and secretes insulin, a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar. Step 4: Insulin lowers sugar levels - Insulin enables the body's cells to absorb the glucose from the bloodstream, effectively lowering the blood sugar levels. Step 5: Body cells absorb glucose and use it for energy - Insulin helps transport glucose into the body's cells where it is utilized as a source of energy. This process allows the body to maintain stable blood sugar levels and ensure that the cells receive the necessary energy to function properly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich son? Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian...

Title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

A:","completion":"Yes, both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay are writers, but they have contributed to literature in noticeably different ways, coming from very different cultural and historical backgrounds. Julio Cortázar was an Argentine writer and translator. Born on August 26, 1914, in Belgium to Argentine parents, Cortázar is widely recognized as one of the most innovative and original writers of his time, and a master of multiple genres, including the short story, the poetic fragment, and non-fiction works. He is often considered one of the founders of the Latin American Boom, a literary movement in the 1960s and 1970s characterized by its stylistic experimentation and political engagement. Cortázar's work was deeply influenced by his home country, Argentina, despite spending most of his life in France. Cortázar's work is characterized by its anti-authoritarian, satirical and surrealistic elements. He is best known for his novels like \\"Final Del Juego\\" and \\"Blow-Up\\", and especially \\"Hopscotch\\" ('Rayuela' in Spanish), a nonlinear novel that can be read according to two different sequences of chapters. This groundbreaking narrative style left a profound impact on the literary world and inspired countless authors worldwide. Coming to Norman Lindsay, he was an Australian artist, sculptor, writer, editorial cartoonist, and scale modeler. He was born on February 23, 1879, in Creswick, Victoria, Australia. As an author, Lindsay is widely known for his children's book \\"The Magic Pudding,\\" which has become a classic of Australian children's literature. In addition to writing children's book, Lindsay also wrote novels and plays for adults, such as \\"Redheap\\" (published in the United States as \\"Every Mother's Son\\") and \\"Miracle in a Wineglass\\". Much of Lindsay's work is known for its satirical and trenchantly conservative views, which often ran counter to the liberal mainstream. Norman Lindsay's work was highly controversial in its time, and he often found himself at odds with Australian authorities. His frank and sumptuous depictions of the nude human figure in both his visual and written work stirred much debate in the conservative art world of his time. In conclusion, Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay were indeed writers, but they clearly differed in their geographical and cultural contexts, their narrative forms, and the topics they chose to explore in their work. Their contributions to their respective literary traditions, and to the broader world literature, makes them notable figures in the realm of letters."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Bring these ingredients to a boil in a large pan over medium heat. Once they reach a boil, bring down the heat to low. Keeping the temperature up too high will result in the barley burning and the water evaporating too quickly. If you don't have 4 people to serve, this recipe is easily cut in half. However, don't necessarily modify the toppings too much – if you like it sweet, you may need just as much sugar! Barley is a tough nut to crack (figuratively, of course. Literally barley is a grain with just a nutty flavor). Because of it's tougher consistency, it takes longer than oats or rice to make tender. Stir every 10 minutes or so, checking on how it's doing. Every pot will differ slightly in the time needed to cook. Keep the lid on as much as possible. When 10 minutes is up, take it off and give it a few stirs with a wooden spoon. When the water is mostly gone, the barley is done. Even if you're looking for a runnier porridge, drain the cooked barley. The water that's left probably won't taste as good and rich as a cup of milk will. This is easiest to do with a plastic or metal colander. If you're in a bind, hold the lid up the edge of the pan and tip it over into the sink to dispel the water. 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, ½ teaspoon cinnamon will turn your plain barley into a regular breakfast feast. Modify the sweetness as you see fit, of course. The milk is necessary (the fatter the milk, the creamier the taste), but you can experiment with the brown sugar and cinnamon and explore other things like honey, fruit juice, or yogurt, too. This is generally how long it takes until the milk has almost been entirely absorbed. What's more, the barley will take on some of the sweet, cinnamon-y flavor. When it has a thick, glutinous, porridge-like consistency, it's done! You can add more milk if you'd like it a little thinner. Right now you just have basic barley porridge. To spice things up, top each dish with walnuts, a drizzle of heavy cream, and fruit, if desired. There’s no getting tired of that! If you're the curious type, try yogurt, peanut butter, cocoa, honey, or any other addition that you think would make the porridge a breakfast of champions.

Introduction: In the fast-paced world of sports, each quarter offers an opportunity for a team to showcase their skills and change the direction of the game. One of the most anticipated moments in a match is the second quarter, where teams often step up their game to either maintain their lead or catch up to their opponents. In this article, we will provide a detailed analysis of a specific game and determine how many scores were made in the second quarter. Step 1: Specify the sport and match Before we begin our analysis, we must first specify the sport and match we are analyzing. As different sports have unique scoring systems and strategies, knowing the sport and match will allow us to accurately gather the necessary data and provide a meaningful analysis. Step 2: Gather the data Now that we have specified the sport and match, we can begin to gather the relevant data. We can obtain this information from a variety of sources, including official records, team websites, and sports analysis platforms. By collecting various types of data, we will ensure that our analysis is comprehensive and unbiased. Step 3: Analyze the scores Upon obtaining the relevant data, we can now analyze the scores for the second quarter. To do this, we must first identify the starting and ending time of the second quarter, then examine the recorded scores within this time frame. It is essential to note which team made each score to understand how the game progressed. Step 4: Break down the scores In addition to determining the total number of scores in the second quarter, it is also helpful to provide a breakdown of these scores. This can include information such as the type of score (field goal, touchdown, etc.), the player who made the score, and the time it occurred during the quarter. By breaking down the scores in this manner, we can gain a deeper understanding of the strategies used by each team and the flow of the game. Step 5: Discuss the impact of the scores Finally, we should explore the impact of the second quarter's scores on the game's outcome. We can analyze how the scores influenced the game's momentum, individual player performance, and overall team dynamics. Doing so will allow our readers to grasp the significance of the events that took place during the second quarter. Conclusion: In summary, determining the number of scores made in the second quarter requires a systematic approach, consisting of specifying the sport and match, gathering data, analyzing scores, breaking down the scores, and discussing their impact.

Answer the question Which of these human activities in a forest has a positive effect on the ecosystem? OPTIONS: (i) Clearing the land to build new homes; (ii) Planting new trees where old ones were cut down; (iii) Building a new highway through the area; (iv) Cutting down trees to make farmland;","completion":"Option (ii) Planting new trees where old ones were cut down is the human activity in a forest that has a positive effect on the ecosystem. Engaging in this activity allows for the replenishment of the lost trees, leading to the restoration of the ecosystem. Forests are essential for life on Earth, as they provide a diverse habitat for countless species of plants and animals. Moreover, they generate oxygen, conserve water, and absorb greenhouse gases to combat climate change. When trees are cut down, it disrupts the delicate balance that these ecosystems rely on to function properly. Planting new trees helps reverse this damage and actively promotes ecosystem restoration. Here are some of the positive effects of planting new trees in a forest ecosystem: 1. Carbon sequestration: New trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps mitigate climate change. They store this carbon in their roots, trunk, branches, and leaves, significantly contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases. 2. Soil stabilization: Tree roots hold the soil together, preventing erosion and landslides. When trees are cut down, soil can become exposed and more susceptible to erosion. Planting new trees helps stabilize the soil once more, preserving the integrity of the ecosystem. 3. Water cycle: Trees play a vital role in the water cycle by absorbing water from the ground and releasing it into the atmosphere through transpiration. Planting new trees helps maintain this process and ensures a stable water supply for other plants and animals in the forest. 4. Biodiversity: By planting new trees, we contribute to a rich biodiversity in forests as they create habitats and provide resources for various species of plants and animals. A diverse ecosystem is essential for the overall health and resilience of the environment. 5. Economic benefits: Forests are valuable sources of raw materials, such as timber and non-timber forest products. Planting new trees ensures a continuous supply of these resources for future generations and promotes sustainable forest management practices. Although the other options (i, iii, and iv) are common human activities, they have negative impacts on forest ecosystems. Building new homes, constructing highways, and cutting down trees for farmland all result in deforestation, which leads to loss of biodiversity, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and disruptions to important ecological processes. In summary, planting new trees where old ones were cut down is the human activity that has a positive effect on forest ecosystems, as it promotes the restoration of these vital environments. By carrying out this activity, we contribute to the fight against climate change, preserve biodiversity, and ensure the various benefits forests provide continue to be available for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was widely known for his contributions to the fields of Holocaust art, specifically within the realms of Realism and Post-Expressionism. During the Holocaust, Samuel was a prisoner at the Treblinka extermination camp, where he survived and participated in a courageous uprising. After World War II, he immigrated to Israel, where he continued to develop his artistic career. Willenberg's experiences during the Holocaust greatly influenced his work, and he memorialized the victims and depicted scenes from concentration camps through his art. Throughout his career, Samuel Willenberg focused on subjects related to Holocaust memory and commemoration. His artwork captured the terror and suffering he and other victims experienced during this dark period. Through his evocative sculptures and paintings, he communicated the hauntingly powerful memories of the Holocaust to his audience. His work in realism and post-expressionism created emotionally charged, visual narratives that effectively portrayed the horrors he witnessed. In addition to his artistic endeavors, Willenberg often shared his eyewitness accounts with various groups and organizations, helping ensure that the history and lessons of the Holocaust remained acknowledged and respected. Samuel Willenberg's art and his commitment to Holocaust remembrance significantly contributed to the global understanding and collective memory of this tragic period. On August 2, 2013, Willenberg returned to the former site of the Treblinka extermination camp, where he paid tribute to the victims and honored the bravery of the inmates. Samuel Willenberg remains an enduring symbol of artistic defiance, resilience, and the perseverance of Holocaust survivors. His work serves as a testament to their strength, as well as a reminder of the importance of memory and understanding. As both a Polish and Israeli national, his dual identity also reflects the complex history and cultural ties between these two nations during the twentieth century."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Journalists at Risk: Considering the Perils and Value of War Reporting Teaching ideas based on New York Times content. Overview | Why have journalists throughout history risked death to bring us living history? What stories are worth risking one’s life for? In this lesson, students perform monologues excerpted from first-person accounts by New York Times journalists who have experienced perilous situations in their pursuit of news. They then analyze photographs taken by photojournalists covering war and other dangers, and discuss why some journalists risk danger and whether the value of what they report is worth that risk. Materials | Computer with Internet access and projector or copies of selected images; copies of the handout In Their Own Words: New York Times War Reporters’ Stories (PDF). Note to Teacher | This lesson involves articles with harrowing content. Please preview the materials in the activities that follow before using them with your class. You may wish to substitute the editorial “A Dangerous Pursuit” for the main article used in the lesson, which contains less graphic content. Warm-Up | Before or at the start of class, ask for four volunteers to read aloud the stories of Times journalists who have confronted danger in the line of duty. The stories are collected on the sheet In Their Own Words: New York Times War Reporters’ Stories (PDF). Note that these pieces are excerpts from articles written by the journalists themselves. Give each volunteer one story to read aloud as if performing a monologue. At the beginning of class, have each “journalist” stand in front of the room and deliver “their” stories. Once they have finished reading, invite the entire class to share their reactions, thoughts or feelings upon hearing these stories. If students have questions about the situations these journalists were covering, follow the article links to share more about the background: “7 Months, 10 Days in Captivity” by David Rohde. “The Reporter’s Account: 4 Days With the Taliban” by Stephen Farrell. “Reporting While Female” by Sabrina Tavernise. “Unhurt by Two Mines, but Not Untouched” by Damon Winter. Follow this reflection by discussing some or all of these questions: Why do you think these reporters put themselves in harm’s way to report? What do we learn from reporters covering wars and other dangerous situations that we might not otherwise learn? How has our worldview and understanding of international events been altered by some of the stories they have told? Do you think the risks they took were worth it? Would you risk your own safety or life to report a news story? Related | In “4 Times Journalists Held Captive in Libya Faced Days of Brutality,” the New York Times journalists Anthony Shadid, Lynsey Addario, Stephen Farrell and Tyler Hicks describe the time they spent in captivity in Libya. Here, they contemplate their role in the disappearance of their driver, Mohammed: From the pickup, Lynsey saw a body outstretched next to our car, one arm outstretched. We still don’t know whether that was Mohammed. We fear it was, though his body has yet to be found. If he died, we will have to bear the burden for the rest of our lives that an innocent man died because of us, because of wrong choices that we made, for an article that was never worth dying for. No article is, but we were too blind to admit that. Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below. Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: Activity | Tell students that they will now work in small groups to analyze photographs published in The Times that were taken in dangerous or otherwise difficult situations. If you wish, model the analysis process by leading whole-group discussion of a single image before having them work in groups, like Image 4 in a slide show of 10 images taken by Tyler Hicks while covering the war in Afghanistan in 2008. Split the class into pairs or small groups, and give each group one image, all from the Lens blog, to analyze. There are many to choose from; below are some suggestions. You might also provide the captions as well as more information from the accompanying posts. To find others, we suggest exploring the Lens and At War blogs, the Multimedia and Photo archive and the World section. Other good sources of photographs are the collections organized under photojournalists’ Times Topics pages, like those for Tyler Hicks, Lynsey Addario and Damon Winter, as well as special features and series like “A Year at War.” Image 2 in the post “At a Deadly, Shifting Front in Libya,” taken by Lynsey Addario in 2011. Image 2 in the post “In the Thick of Libya’s Brutal Fighting,” taken by Tyler Hicks in 2011. Image 5 in the post Even the Middle Ground is Perilous in Cairo,” taken by Ed Ou in 2011. Image 1 in the post “Unhurt by Two Mines, but Not Touched,” taken by Damon Winter in 2010. Image 5 in the post On Assignment: Katrina Many Times Over,” taken by Michael Appleton in Haiti in 2010. Images 11 and 13 in the post “‘It’s the Photographer,’” taken by Joao Silva in 2010. The photograph of the soldier in the pink boxer shorts, taken by David Guttenfelder of The Associated Press in Afghanistan 2009. Groups should discuss the following questions: In discussing these questions, circulate to help students understand the kinds of things reporters and photojournalists have to go through to get their stories and photos – navigating language barriers and finding translators, hiring drivers, locating and interviewing or photographing sources, negotiating with soldiers and fighters, and so on. And then, of course, there are the issues of safety and danger. When students are ready to share and discuss their photograph with their classmates, reconvene the class. Have each group show the rest of the class the photograph they examined and share highlights of their analysis, as well as invite others to volunteer their observations and ideas. After all groups have shared, discuss what similarities and differences they noticed among all of the photographs they examined. Ask: What if the public never had the chance to see any of these images and others like them? How would our understanding of world events be affected if journalists were not willing to face personal peril or emotional difficulty to cover news events? What has the world gained through the work of these reporters? Is it worth the risk? Why or why not? Might it be worthwhile in some situations and not in others? Going Further | Each student “adopts” a war correspondent or other journalist to study more closely. They should look at their journalist’s body of work and any personal stories about the perils they have faced to get their stories. You might have the class choose from a list of journalists from around the world and throughout history, from various news organizations. Wikipedia’s page on war correspondents might be useful as you formulate your list. Include teams of journalists, like Laura Ling and Euna Lee, and war photojournalists throughout history. Topics should include war and other military engagements, harrowing stories like the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Japan and dangerous situations like the protests in Egypt in early 2011. Resources include the Newseum’s War Stories feature and the Telegraph article “Women War Correspondents.” They should research how the reporter(s) got the story and the risks he, she or they took to obtain it. Students should be prepared to tell this story in class and share whether or not, given the subject and its significance, those risks were worth taking. Journalism students might consider how to “localize” international news for their own school newspaper, as students in Rockville, Md., have done.

They ran around their cages jumping up and down. My heart became soft at the sight of these poor creatures. I entered the building and discovered more unwanted animals. A white rabbit jumped around in its cage. I walked around the shelter,screaming \\"oh\\" and \\"ah\\" at every animal,as they looked out of their cages,waiting for love and help. A pit bull particularly interested me. She was as gentle as a baby. I slightly touched her head with affection as she sat on the floor. The pit bull licked my hand with appreciation as she cried. A litter of puppies were in the cage opposite the pit bull. They snuggled together for warmth as one of the puppies let out a weak bark,as if calling to its mother. Recognizing my love and willingness to help these puppies,the director suggested I give them a bath. I lifted one of the puppies,Yukie,from his brothers and sisters. His black fur was as soft as cotton candy. I held him tightly. The sweet smell of liquid soap surrounded the wash area. The puppy seemed like a tiny fish,swimming delightedly in a pool. Water dropped down his black,soft ears as he tried to shake off the heavy water. I wrapped Yukie in a towel as he licked my hand. After all the cleaning and drying,he looked as if he'd come from an expensive pet shop. I kissed his little face as I unwillingly placed him back. Next,I walked some dogs around the shelter. They jumped out of their cages,unable to hold back their urge for exercise. I ran around with them,while touching them gently and talking to them. They moved back when the time came to put them back.

Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \\"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label\\", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \\"essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction\\": \\"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\\". In \\"That's All Right\\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \\"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \\"rockabilly's originator\\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \\"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \\"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\\" In Moore's view, too, \\"It had been there for quite a while, really.

In his opinion, the diet drinks offered a more satisfying taste experience in contrast to the diet foods, which he found to be comparatively lacking. He believed that the diet drinks maintained a flavorful composure, somehow managing to balance lower calorie content with taste. This, in his view, made them an ideal companion for his fitness goals, as he could enjoy them without compromising his dietary requirements. Conversely, diet foods proved to be a formidable challenge for his tastebuds. Despite acknowledging their valuable nutritional advantages and the positive impact they could potentially have on his health and physique, he found it hard to embrace them due to what he considered a disagreeable taste. Whether it was the low-fat cheese that lost its satisfying creaminess, or the sugar-free cookies that didn't carry the same sweetness he loved, diet foods seemed to him a hollow imposter of the original, lacking the depth and richness that he had come to associate with good food. Despite his distaste for diet foods, he understood their importance in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and acknowledged his role in adapting to these new culinary encounters. He realized that perhaps it was more about adjusting his expectations of what food should taste like, rather than an inherent issue with the diet foods themselves. In the end, he had come to make a distinction between diet drinks and diet foods, with the former being a welcomed addition to his lifestyle and the latter still a subject of culinary debate. It ultimately came down to the perception of taste: for him, the drinks tasted wonderful, but the diet foods left more to be desired.

Question: What does Annie start calling Ebby?

Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher.

Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs).

Nielsen Media Reserch indicates that Fox News' prime-time average was 7 million total viewers, while CNN earned 2.4 million and MSNBC earned 1.9 million. Compared to the 2006 midterm elections, Fox News' prime-time viewership was up 128%, while CNN's was down 18% and MSNBC's stayed the same. Early reports hint that FNC might also dominate the broadcast network election coverage, but the final numbers for the broadcast networks will not be available until Thursday morning. — Melissa Maerz ||||| Luke Sharrett for The New York Times As a Republican wave swept across the United States on Tuesday, the Fox News Channel drew the biggest midterm election audience in its history. Fox News, a favorite of Republicans with its stable of conservative hosts like Glenn Beck, had an average of 6.96 million viewers in prime time on Tuesday, according to the Nielsen Company. That was more than double the audience for CNN, which drew an average of 2.42 million viewers Tuesday night, and more than triple that for MSNBC, at 1.94 million viewers. Reliable ratings for the broadcast networks’ coverage of the midterms will not be available until Thursday, Nielsen said. There were early indications, however, that Fox News would top the broadcasters’ averages. Fox recorded an average of 3.06 million viewers on election night in 2006, when there was a Democratic wave. Fox has grown significantly more popular since then. The audience for CNN, by contrast, fell — it had an average of 2.97 million viewers on election night in 2006. MSNBC’s prime-time average was almost exactly the same in 2006 and 2010. On the night of the presidential election in 2008, CNN drew an average of 12.3 million viewers in prime time, Fox had 9 million, and MSNBC 5.9 million. The cable news channels’ ratings were inflated all day because of the election, but even more so for Fox.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: After the story ends, what do you think readers purchase?

Possible answers: excited by having to get ready in a hurry, eager to go back to sleep, panicked about being late for school","completion":"When Jordan realizes that they have slept through their alarm and are running late for school, it is possible that they would experience an array of intense emotions. These emotions could range from panic and anxiety about being late for school, excitement from having to get ready in a hurry, as well as a desire to go back to sleep. Each of these potential emotions could be experienced depending on Jordan's individual personality, priorities, and their current life circumstances. Firstly, given that Jordan is late for school, panic and anxiety would be the most likely emotions they would initially experience. Panic is a common response to situations in which an individual faces unexpected pressure or time constraints. In this case, Jordan might be worried about what their teachers or classmates would think if they turned up late without any plausible explanation or how their tardiness could potentially affect their academic performance. Additionally, the knowledge that they are not following their usual routine could add to their feelings of discomfort and chaos, which could further exacerbate their panic. Secondly, as Jordan hastens to make up for lost time, they may become excited by having to get ready in a hurry. This adrenaline rush, often associated with impromptu actions or decisions, could be seen as a way for Jordan to re-energize and kick-start their day. This sudden burst of energy may help to arouse and invigorate their senses, making them more alert and focused as they attempt to complete their morning routine in less than the usual time. This excitement may temporarily distract them from the consequences of being late for school, allowing them to concentrate on overcoming their current state of disarray. However, after such an intense burst of energy, it is plausible that Jordan might feel overwhelmed and eager to go back to sleep. Once the excitement and adrenaline of getting ready in a hurry wear off, the reality of the situation and possible consequences of their tardiness could set in, leading to feelings of exhaustion and emotional turmoil. If Jordan is someone who places a high value on sleep and recovery time, their desire to rest and recuperate from the sudden change in routine may be especially heightened. Exhaustion and fatigue could also exacerbate feelings of anxiety or concern about facing the day unprepared and late for school. Each of these potential emotional responses provides insight into Jordan's potential feelings after sleeping through their alarm and running late for school. The combination of panic, excitement, and a desire to return to sleep would vary depending on their unique personality, existing habits, and the current state of their life. The manifestation of these emotions would ultimately dictate Jordan's reaction and behavior throughout the day, consequently shaping their emotional narrative and experience during this period of tardiness."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The new figures still amount to a sharp decline. Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified. Senior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.

Option A: 388 Option B: 476 Option C: 557 Option D: 2885 Option E: 271","completion":"First, let's find the dimensions of the room after leaving a 0.25 m space around it. Since the space is present on both sides of each dimension, we will subtract 0.50m (twice the space, that is 2*(0.25m)) from both dimensions. Adjusted length (L) = 9 m - 0.50 m = 8.50 m Adjusted width (W) = 4 m - 0.50 m = 3.50 m Next, we need to convert the adjusted dimensions into centimeters to match the units of the tile's side. Adjusted length in centimeters: L = 8.50 m * 100 cm/m = 850 cm Adjusted width in centimeters: W = 3.50 m * 100 cm/m = 350 cm Now, calculate the number of tiles required along the length and width to cover the adjusted floor. Tiles along the length: TL = Adjusted length / Tile's side = 850 cm / 25 cm = 34 tiles Tiles along the width: TW = Adjusted width / Tile's side = 350 cm / 25 cm = 14 tiles Finally, find the total number of square tiles required by multiplying the number of tiles along the length and the width. Total square tiles = TL * TW = 34 * 14 = 476 So, the correct answer is Option B: 476."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the passage. Atlanta (CNN) -- The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration confiscated a potent drug commonly used in lethal injections from a state correctional facility cache.

The","completion":"U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been actively monitoring the use and distribution of sodium thiopental in recent years, as the drug has become increasingly scarce and difficult to obtain due to international regulations and manufacturer discontinuations. Though originally utilized for various medical purposes, sodium thiopental is now primarily associated with its use in lethal injections, as one component of a three-drug protocol that has been standard practice in many states. The sedative acts quickly to render the inmate unconscious, while subsequent drugs cause paralysis and cardiac arrest. The DEA, in its oversight role, is responsible for ensuring that controlled substances, such as sodium thiopental, are procured, stored, and utilized in compliance with federal regulations. Any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the management of these drugs can prompt an investigation. In this case, Georgia Department of Corrections' spokeswoman Joan Heath has indicated that the department proactively reached out to the DEA for assistance in evaluating their internal processes and protocols surrounding sodium thiopental. The origins of sodium thiopental at the correctional facility are currently unclear, and the thorough DEA investigation will likely focus on reconstructing the chain of custody for the drug. The agency will examine whether the substance was obtained legally and ethically, and whether its storage and handling practices adhered to federal guidelines. In addition to examining the facility's procurement procedures, the DEA may also probe whether proper licenses were held, whether the drug was accurately documented and accounted for, and whether any diversion or tampering occurred while it was in the possession of the correctional facility. Regulatory and ethical concerns around the use of sodium thiopental in lethal injections have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Some drug manufacturers have ceased production of the drug entirely, while others have put measures in place to prevent its sale to correctional facilities for use in executions. As a result, some states have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining the drug, leading to temporary halts in executions and lengthy legal battles. The ongoing review of the Georgia correctional facility's management of sodium thiopental could have broad implications for capital punishment in the state. Pending the outcome of the DEA investigation, Georgia may face challenges in carrying out scheduled executions, potentially prompting additional legal disputes and sparking renewed public debate over the use of lethal injections. Ultimately, the DEA's actions serve as a stark reminder of the persistent and complex issues surrounding the use of lethal drugs in the U.S. criminal justice system. As the debate continues and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, states and their correctional facilities must navigate a shifting landscape in their efforts to comply with federal guidelines while upholding their commitments to the administration of capital punishment."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

To understand the reasons behind this interpretation, we need to analyze the sentence and break it down to specific elements: 1. Vocabulary and tone: The sentence uses words and phrases such as \\"no matter how,\\" \\"speculation,\\" \\"conspiracy theories,\\" and \\"circumstantial evidence.\\" These are all negative terms that create an atmosphere of skepticism and doubt. 2. Contrasting elements: The sentence starts by seemingly giving credit to \\"Broomfield\\" for \\"dressing it up\\" – however, this is immediately followed by a contrast, as the rest of the sentence undermines the credibility of Broomfield's efforts. This introduces a negative sentiment because it implies that nothing positive can be achieved no matter how hard Broomfield tries. 3. Enumerating negative outcomes: The second half of the sentence lists three distinct negative outcomes that result from Broomfield's efforts: a) Speculation - implying that the situation leads to unestablished or unfounded thoughts and ideas. b) Conspiracy theories - suggesting that Broomfield's work might encourage people to believe in falsified or unverified claims. c) Circumstantial evidence - stating that the best possible outcome from Broomfield's work is only based on indirect, rather than strong and concrete, evidence. All these outcomes have negative connotations, casting a negative light on the sentence. In conclusion, based on the vocabulary, tone, contrasting elements, and the enumeration of unfavorable outcomes, the sentiment of the given sentence can be determined as negative."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It is found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, although it is not known where it originated. This plant is known in English as water spinach, river spinach, water morning glory, water convolvulus, or by the more ambiguous names Chinese spinach, Chinese Watercress, Chinese convolvulus, swamp cabbage or kangkong in Southeast Asia. Occasionally, it has also been mistakenly called \\"kale\\" in English, although kale is a strain of mustard belonging to the species \\"Brassica oleracea\\" and is completely unrelated to water spinach, which is a species of morning glory. It is known as \\"phak bung\\" in Thai and Laotian, \\"eng chai\\" in Teochew and Hokkien, \\"ong choy\\" (蕹菜) in Cantonese, \\"kongxincai\\" (空心菜) in Mandarin Chinese, \\"rau muống\\" in Vietnamese, \\"kangkong\\" in Tagalog, \\"kangkung\\" in Indonesian and Malay, \\"gazun\\" in Myanmar, \\"trokuon\\" (ត្រកួន) in Khmer, \\"kolmou xak\\" in Assamese,\\"வள்ளல்\\" (vallal) in Tamil, \\"kalmi saag\\" in Hindi, \\"kalmi shak\\" in Bengali, \\"Thooti Koora\\" in Telugu, \\"Kalama Saga\\" in Odia, \\"hayoyo\\" in Ghana.

Context_2 : Bonamia grandiflora is a rare species of flowering plant in the morning glory family known by the common names Florida lady's nightcap, Florida bonamia, and scrub morning glory. It is endemic to Central Florida, where there are about 100 known populations remaining, many of which are within the bounds of the Ocala National Forest. The plant has declined in recent decades primarily due to the development of its habitat, which is being converted to urban zones and citrus groves. This is the primary reason that the plant was federally listed as a threatened species in 1987. Context_3 : Gunnera is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants. Some species have extremely large leaves. Species in the genus are variously native to Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Papuasia, Hawaii, insular Southeast Asia, Africa, and Madagascar.

Is the premise \\"One nun being patted down by a TSA agent in front of an American flag, while a civilian looks on.\\" true if \\"a nun has hid a gun in her habit.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"One nun being patted down by a TSA agent in front of an American flag, while a civilian looks on\\" could be true if \\"a nun has hid a gun in her habit,\\" but there are multiple factors to consider in order to determine whether the given situation is truly plausible. Firstly, it is essential to take into account the strict security protocols followed by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at airports in the United States. In the case of a nun, it can be assumed that she is traveling in her religious attire, which is her habit. The presence of a hidden gun within the nun's habit implies that there might be cause for suspicion, or the presence of the weapon might have been detected through airport security measures such as metal detectors, X-ray machines, or even canine units. In accordance with TSA regulations, if a concealed weapon is detected or there is reasonable suspicion, the passenger is subject to further security checks. These procedures might involve a pat-down by a TSA agent, which checks for prohibited items on a person's body. In this case, a nun would also be subject to these additional security measures, regardless of her religious status. It is not uncommon for TSA checkpoints to be situated in areas where there are American flags displayed, especially in airports within the United States. Thus, it is possible that the scene where a nun is being patted down by a TSA agent would occur in front of an American flag. Furthermore, as airport security checkpoints are typically busy and open to public view, it would not be surprising for a civilian to witness the unfolding situation. However, it is important to note that while the premise could be true given the provided context, further details and specifics would be required for a more accurate assessment. Factors such as the reason behind the nun's decision to carry a concealed weapon, her behavior that might have aroused suspicion, and the procedures followed by the TSA agents would contribute to determining the plausibility of the premise. In conclusion, the premise \\"One nun being patted down by a TSA agent in front of an American flag, while a civilian looks on\\" could be true if \\"a nun has hid a gun in her habit,\\" provided that the appropriate security measures have detected the weapon and the TSA agents have followed all necessary protocols in conducting a pat-down. Additionally, the presence of an American flag in the vicinity and a civilian witnessing the event can be considered realistic within the context of an airport's security checkpoint."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Revenge of the Ideologues: Killing the Export-Import Bank “Idiotic,” sputtered Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. “Mind-bogglingly idiotic.” She was talking about something she has been fighting for months: the effort by conservative ideologues to prevent the Export-Import Bank of the United States from being reauthorized. The Ex-Im Bank that supports tens of thousands of good American jobs. The Ex-Im Bank that helps land deals, for both small businesses wanting to expand and giant American exporters, that would otherwise go to foreign companies. The Ex-Im Bank that in its last fiscal year generated enough in fees and interest to turn over 675 million to the Treasury. Why would anyone in their right mind want to put such a useful agency out of business? In truth, a vast majority of senators — Republicans included — very much want to see the Ex-Im Bank live to lend another day. So do most businesspeople, no matter what their politics. This week, when a reauthorization amendment was attached to the big Senate highway bill, it got 64 votes. Jim McNerney, the chairman of Boeing, noting that the Ex-Im Bank helps keep manufacturing jobs in America, wrote recently in Politico, “I never thought I’d see the day that U.S. companies would, in effect, be penalized by their own government for not setting up shop overseas and, in the case of Boeing, expanding our domestic production and work force by billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.” Heitkamp is not exaggerating: Eliminating the Ex-Im Bank truly is mind-boggling. You’ll recall that the bank, which had never been controversial until about three years ago, needed to be reauthorized by the end of June. That didn’t happen, as the Republican leadership, bowing to its extremist wing, allowed the date to pass without a reauthorization vote. That meant the bank had to stop underwriting new loans, though it continues to manage its 107 billion loan portfolio. Then this week, even after the overwhelming Senate vote — and knowing full well that the House would approve reauthorization if given the chance — House leaders refused to include it in their ridiculously short-term three-month extension of the highway funding bill. (Which, by the way, is another shortsighted, anti-American-jobs move.) So now supporters have to hope they can get a reauthorization vote in September, a month when the House has only 12 legislative days on the calendar. (The Senate has 15.) And if they don’t succeed? There would be no one left to manage the portfolio, which under its charter only the Ex-Im Bank can handle. Another is that the Ex-Im insurance many banks rely on will expire — and in all likelihood the banks will start calling in those loans. Boeing, being the country’s largest exporter by dollar volume, has said that if its customers no longer have access to the Ex-Im Bank — export credit agencies are vital in aircraft deals — it might have to move some operations offshore to gain access to other countries’ export credit. Fred Hochberg, the president of the Ex-Im Bank, told me that at a recent meeting at the White House, one small-business man said that competitors were trying to poach his customers, knowing that he no longer had Ex-Im support. Another businessman, who runs a machine parts manufacturer in Erie, Pa., said many of the companies around Erie are General Electric suppliers. “If G.E. does less exporting, the whole supply chain will get less work,” he said. These are not bluffs. This is how the world actually works. Hochberg had a few other things to say when we spoke. The argument by opponents that “most drives me crazy is that we’re a form of crony capitalism. We’re the opposite of that,” he said. “Companies come to us when they can’t get a deal done any other way. I had about 15 bankers in here yesterday, and they were thunderstruck. One banker said, ‘If I could do deals without you I would. I make more money when you’re not in the deal.’” “In the six and a half years I’ve been in this job, the world has gotten so much more cutthroat competitive,” Hochberg added. Noting that both China’s and India’s export-credit agencies have said, in effect, they were looking forward to a world in which they didn’t have to compete with the Ex-Im Bank, he said that the effort to put it out of business “seems ludicrous.” Heitkamp thinks that if the ideologues succeed in finishing off the Ex-Im Bank, it will be only the beginning of such efforts. “What will they do with the Small Business Administration?” she asked. “What about the other tools we provide to small business? I don’t think I’m being alarmist in saying that if they win this debate, what’s next?” With the Ex-Im Bank, the extreme right has drawn a line in the sand. Given the very real benefits it provides exporters, the time has come for the rest of us to do the same. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text revolve around the ongoing debate over the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank). The author argues that eliminating the Ex-Im Bank would be detrimental to American businesses, jobs, and the economy. Key points include: 1. The Ex-Im Bank generates revenue for the Treasury, which totaled 675 million in its last fiscal year. 2. A majority of senators and businesspeople want the Ex-Im Bank to be reauthorized in order to continue supporting American businesses and jobs. 3. The Ex-Im Bank has become controversial due to an extremist wing of the Republican party opposing its reauthorization, resulting in the bank not being able to underwrite new loans. 4. The author argues that eliminating the Ex-Im Bank would lead to negative consequences for American businesses, such as Boeing potentially moving operations offshore and smaller businesses facing increased competition. 5. The president of the Ex-Im Bank, Fred Hochberg, argues against the notion that the bank represents crony capitalism and emphasizes its importance in supporting American businesses in a highly competitive global market. 6. Finally, the author raises concerns about the potential impact on other agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, if ideologues succeed in eliminating the Ex-Im Bank."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can use a variety of different types of housing, ranging from one you purchase to one you have around the house. If you have more than one chick, make sure the habitat can comfortably accommodate all of them. Consider some of the following options for your chick’s home: A simple cardboard box An aquarium A cat carrier A guinea pig cage Because it is so young and small, your chick is especially vulnerable to falling from its habitat or becoming prey for other animals. Keep the habitat in a space where your chick can’t fall or escape and where pets can’t gain access to her. Consider putting a ventilated lid on the habitat for times when you are not home or unable to watch your chick. This can keep other animals out while protecting your chick from falling out of the cage. Avoid putting the habitat in any spaces that are very high off the ground. This can protect your chicks from falling too far, which can be fatal Chicks and chickens are very sensitive to temperature. It’s important to line your chick’s habitat with materials to help keep it warm, which can prevent disease or death. Line the housing with old towels or blankets for the chick’s first few weeks of life. Make sure the lining has no loose strings, which your chick can swallow or might strangle her. Switch to a lining of straw and newspaper after a few weeks. Make sure to cover the bottom of the habitat with enough straw because the slippery surface of the newspaper can cause your chick’s legs to grow malformed. Chicks generally need to be kept warm but should also have a habitat that has a range of temperatures. Use a lamp to heat one side of the habitat while keeping the other side cooler. This allows your chick to freely decide at which temperature she feels more comfortable throughout the day. Construct a heat source using a 100watt light bulb in a reflective clamp style lamp or an infrared reptile heat bulb. Install either option on one side of the habitat. You can get both lamps at most pet and home stores. Make sure the temperature is a constant 90-100 degrees for the first few weeks of the chick’s life. Your chick is the best thermometer for her habitat: if she is hiding on the opposite corner of the habitat from the lamp, then it is too hot. If she is smothering herself in the blankets or along with other chicks, then you need to increase the heat. Consider keeping your chick’s habitat away from radiators or non-lamp heating devices to help maintain a warm and consistent temperature. You may also want to keep it away from drafty areas. Once you get your chick, it’s time to introduce her to her new home. You can do this by gently holding her and releasing her into the habitat. Talk to her and assure her with by patting her that she can enter and be comfortable. Consider staying with your chick for an hour or so to help her get used to her habitat.","completion":"This article discusses various housing options and considerations for creating a comfortable and safe chick habitat, emphasizing temperature regulation and protection from falls or predators."},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who wants to buy a horse farm? ?

Some are skeptical of a single approach to training all clients. There are concerns that the competitive nature of the workouts might lead to injuries, and others call out the culture and label CrossFit a \\"cult.\\" That'd be enough for most people to second guess themselves, but Glassman has never wavered. \\"I'm more comfortable arguing than I am being told how wonderful my program is,\\" the 59-year-old founder said. \\"You're not going to do anything significant in this world without having people hating you for it.\\" Glassman intended CrossFit to be a departure from what he didn't like in the \\"big box gyms.\\" ||||| Past the throngs of thick necks, ripped abs, bulging quads and trapezius muscles so developed that the accompanying arms don’t really lay down the way they should, a middle-aged dude with a beer gut in a backwards-turned ball cap manned an unassuming post beneath the rafters, watching a bunch of people in way better shape than him hoist barbells into the air at the regional semifinals of the CrossFit Games at the Moda Center, the biggest indoor venue in Portland, Ore. If you thought Greg Glassman might be intimidated by all these perfectly sculpted creatures, though, you’d be wrong. Glassman is the founder of CrossFit, the fitness program that has come to dominate the athletic world, ballooning into an empire of 4 million members practicing at 13,000 gyms in more than 120 countries. It’s as if he sculpted all these people himself. Winston Ross for Newsweek “I really like watching the bodies. Especially the women,” Glassman told Newsweek on Saturday. “These young gals, what you’re looking at is capacity. I walked by one of my female monsters that came by and gave me a hug. You couldn’t see a “Lara Croft” or “La Femme Nikita” without being aroused by that fascinating interplay of female beauty and soul-crushing capacity. It’s not lost on me either. I walk these halls, and I know I make these monsters. And it makes me proud.” Glassman has reason to be proud. Fitness fads tend to come and go, but CrossFit has endured and expanded at a seemingly unstoppable pace, especially given the amount of dubious publicity the technique has gotten from naysayers who worry that it causes injuries. Despite years of battling his critics, Glassman doesn’t shy away from questions about whether CrossFit is good for you. He leans into them. Two years ago, CrossFit filed a lawsuit against the National Strength and Conditioning Association, alleging the organization’s Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research released a “junk science” study that suggested CrossFit causes injuries at a high rate. “Nobody is getting hurt,” Glassman says, offering the reduced premiums paid by those who buy insurance via CrossFit’s “Risk Retention Group” as evidence that members are actually less likely to file any kind of injury-based claim than they would elsewhere. “They’re eating meats and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some starch, a little fruit. That’s what’s happening.” Winston Ross for Newsweek Glassman doesn’t stop there. His critics are all fueled by the sugar and soda industries, he insists, because its representatives are threatened by the fitness company’s war on sugar and sugary drinks. CrossFit maintains a website, crushbigsoda.com , that advocates for warning labels on sugary drinks in California. “We are at war. We’re going to drive Big Soda out of the health sciences,” he says. He accuses soda industry “shills” of conspiring with lawmakers in eight different states to introduce legislation that would exclude CrossFit trainers from getting licenses, all because he’s publicly attacked the makers of sugary drinks, he says. Glassman has been particularly critical of Gatorade in recent years, claiming that the company’s hydration guidelines (encouraging athletes to chug Gatorade to recover from dehydration) are hurting athletes. “While I’m opening gyms all over the country, these assholes are in the houses and senates trying to ramrod legislation,” Glassman says. “The soda companies have invested significantly in keeping us unaware of what the problems are.” He’s still dumbfounded by what CrossFit has become, Glassman says, and he’ll probably never quite get used to being famous. “Anyone who wants strangers coming up to them and telling them they’re wonderful is a sociopath,” he says. “I enjoy the controversy. I’m proud of the success, and I’m a little bit retiring in regard to the love.” ||||| We require warning labels on other toxic products like tobacco and alcohol, so why don’t we hold sugar-loaded beverages to the same standard? Over time, chronic soda consumption has a similar effect on your liver as chronic alcohol consumption. In increasing numbers, Californians, especially children, are suffering from diseases typically associated with alcoholism – type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease – without the alcohol. During the same period that sugary drink consumption doubled in the United States, diabetes rates tripled. And that’s just one of the health problems associated with the rise of sugary drink consumption in the United States. While the beverage industry profits from dishonest science and corrupted health information, California faces a health crisis. And it’s bankrupting our cities and swamping our overcrowded emergency rooms. California’s Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Safety Warning Act (SB 300) will require a reasonable, factual safety warning on all sugary drink bottles, cans, vending machines, and dispensaries: STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and tooth decay. Big Soda doesn’t want Californians to know that their products are killing us. Warning labels empower consumers and parents to make informed choices about the beverages they purchase for their families. It’s time to end Big Soda’s dishonest campaign to suppress the truth. Tell Sacramento to get smart on commonsense soda labeling and vote yes on SB 300 on April 19. If you support your right to know the truth about your health, ask your elected representative to do the same: Support SB 300. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In this article, Greg Glassman, founder of CrossFit, addresses the criticisms faced by his fitness program.

As much as he loves his job, he longs for something more meaningful in life. One day, while browsing the internet after another ordinary day at the store, Kern comes across a heartfelt story about Valentine, a struggling animal rescuer in a remote town. Valentine's shelter, named \\"Whiskers and Wags,\\" provides a temporary home for injured and abandoned animals, giving them a second chance at life in loving forever homes. Feeling a strong connection with Valentine's mission, Kern decides to send money every month to support her cause and to help care for the animals. As time goes by, they keep in touch through emails and handwritten letters. They exchange heartfelt stories and create a unique bond over their shared love for animals. Kern soon becomes a regular contributor, and Valentine eagerly utilizes the funds for the medical treatment of the animals in dire need of a vet. One day, Kern receives an urgent letter from Valentine, seeking assistance with a challenging case. A dog, nicknamed \\"Moon,\\" has been found with a severely injured leg, which would require expensive and complex surgery to save. Feeling compelled to help, Kern decides to visit Valentine's town and offer his assistance in supporting Moon's recovery. Upon his arrival, Kern is welcomed with open arms by Valentine and the townspeople. He finds that the shelter is much more than just a temporary sanctuary for animals, but also serves as a symbol of hope and unity for the people who inhabit the town. As Moon's surgery takes place, Kern and Valentine work tirelessly to raise funds and awareness for the cause through community events. As Moon recovers, a remarkable love story develops between Kern and Valentine. Their love not only unites them but also strengthens the community, and inspires them to grow Whiskers and Wags into a regional animal welfare movement. When the time finally comes for Moon to be adopted, a local family eagerly brings the lovable dog into their home. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, not only for Moon but also for Kern and Valentine. They continue their tireless efforts to save the lives of neglected, injured, and abandoned animals. 'A Tale of Tails' is a heartwarming story of love, companionship, and the remarkable impact of saving the lives of animals in need. Kern and Valentine's inspiring journey reminds us that we can all make a difference in the world, one tail wag at a time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Anna Riviere was one of the most admired of 19th-century English sopranos . She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73.

News article: KBR Sharply Cuts Year’s Outlook on Unexpected Costs Engineering and construction firm KBR Inc. KBR 1.48 % said Friday that it was sharply cutting annual profit guidance mostly due to unexpected costs linked to two electric power-generating, or EPC, facilities. The two projects are expected to pressure earnings on a per-share, pretax basis by 91 cents. The company said it now expects full-year earnings to be between 30 cents and 50 cents a share, down from the former outlook calling for a range of 1.20 to 1.45. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 1.45 a share. KBR’s revised outlook excludes legal costs of 15 million, or 11 cents a share, associated with legacy U.S. government contracts. KBR said it would seek to regain some of its losses from project vendors but didn’t calculate possible reimbursements into their new forecast. The gloomier outlook help drive shares of the company down 7.5% after hours to 14. The Houston-based energy-construction and government-contracting company has been working to reshape its operations on the more lucrative government services business amid declines in certain contracts and the effect of lower energy prices on many firms’ capital spending budgets. “While the cost increases are highly disappointing, particularly on the power project, these legacy projects are nearing completion and we will not execute any new stand-alone fixed-price EPC power projects,” said Stuart Bradie, KBR CEO. “We believe this performance confirms that the decision for KBR to exit from the fixed-price EPC power business is the right one.” Write to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Watt said Monday that he has distributed the 41.6 million his foundation raised to help rebuild the Texas Gulf Coast after Hurricane Harvey. An online fundraiser Watt launched after the storm hit Texas last year went viral and far exceeded his original goal of raising 200,000. \\"It's incredible to see just the generosity of strangers and what it's able to do and what it's able to accomplish, and the fact that that's just year one,\\" Watt said. \\"We still have more to do and we still have a lot going on moving forward.\\" Watt routed the money to eight groups actively involved in Texas' rebuilding and recovery. According to the Texans, the funds have already been used to clean up and rebuild more than 600 homes, distribute more than 26 million meals and provide health care to more than 6,500 people. The three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year has dealt with serious injuries in each of the last two seasons, playing just eight games combined in 2016-17, though he's back and healthy now. He said working on this project and seeing how people came together to help others in such a huge time of need was good for him. \\"As you look back on it, you really understand how incredible it really was and how thankful that I am for so many people to help out and to be willing to help out,\\" Watt said. \\"I was going through some tough times myself the last two years, so I think that it really helped show me the good side of people and that I should have hope and ... have positivity.\\" Houston coach Bill O'Brien said he spoke to the team Monday about the impact Watt's fundraiser had on the community, and he raved about his superstar defensive end. \\"I don't even know if words can describe that, what he's meant to the city of Houston, everything that he's done,\\" O'Brien said. \\"He was hands-on with it. He's been hands-on with how to distribute the money, where it goes, all those things. We have a great deal of respect for what he's done, and I know the city does, too.\\" Watt, who is entering his eighth NFL season, talked about how moved he was that everyone from celebrities to children with lemonade stands helped raise funds to help the victims of the storm, which made landfall last Aug. 25 and left torrential flooding in its wake. He said he felt a lot of pressure to make sure the money was used to make the biggest impact in areas where it was needed most. \\"Obviously, I wasn't planning on being in such a wild situation from the start, but I had an incredible support team around me and I had tons of people help me out,\\" he said. \\"We did loads and loads of research and we spent hours and hours doing the phone calls and the meetings and talking with everybody and gathering as much information as we could, so we could do it the right way.\\" \\"Because that's the only thing that we wanted out of all of it — we wanted to do it the right way and make sure that we did proud to people who trusted us,\\" Watt said. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFLfootball and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Howland talked but little on their way back to camp. The scene that he had just witnessed affected him strangely; it stirred once more within him all of his old ambition, all of his old enthusiasm, and yet neither found voice in words. He was glad when the dinner was over at Thorne's, and with the going of the mail sledge and the senior engineer there came over him a still deeper sense of joy. Now _he_ was in charge, it was _his_ road from that hour on. He crushed MacDonald's hand in a grip that meant more than words when they parted. In his own cabin he threw off his coat and hat, lighted his pipe, and tried to realize just what this all meant for him. He was in charge--in charge of the greatest railroad building job on earth--_he_, Jack Howland, who less than twenty years ago was a barefooted, half-starved urchin peddling papers in the streets where he was now famous! And now what was this black thing that had come up to threaten his chances just as he had about won his great fight?

So I was trying to sleep one time, and I sleep under the blankets 99% of the time. I sleep downstairs, so hearing noise is pretty normal. Also, my door doesn’t lock, or even latch the door handle, so you can just push it open. So I was laying down, maybe at 60% in terms of how close I was to falling asleep, so I just had to lay down for like 5 more minutes.

Lately, Seattle's offensive line has been making it easy for the Seahawks running back to find the open lanes and open field, too.","completion":"This excerpt is about Shaun Alexander, a former American football running back who played for the Seattle Seahawks in the National Football League (NFL). The text highlights Alexander's ability to score touchdowns and praises the Seattle Seahawks' offensive line for creating opportunities for him to excel on the field. Shaun Alexander was a standout running back during his time in the NFL, playing for the Seattle Seahawks from 2000 to 2007 and for the Washington Redskins in 2008. He earned numerous accolades throughout his career, including three invitations to the Pro Bowl, the 2005 NFL MVP award, and the honor of being inducted into the Seahawks' Ring of Honor. Alexander was known for his exceptional vision, quickness, and nose for the end zone, which allowed him to be one of the most productive running backs in the league at his peak. The excerpt emphasizes the importance of Seattle's offensive line in making it easy for Alexander to demonstrate his skills and find success on the field. The offensive line is crucial to a running back's success, as their primary job is to block for the quarterback and the running backs. Blocking consists of using their bodies to create space and open lanes for the ball carrier, making it easier for them to advance down the field. A strong offensive line can significantly enhance a running back's performance by providing them with more opportunities to make big plays and score touchdowns. In Shaun Alexander's case, Seattle's offensive line played a key role in allowing him to exploit open lanes and open fields effectively. This not only highlights the outstanding individual talent of Alexander but also the collective skills of the Seahawks' offensive line, which was integral in paving the way for his success. In conclusion, this excerpt is about the outstanding abilities of Shaun Alexander and the role that the Seattle Seahawks' offensive line played in his success as a running back. Their combined efforts led to some of the most dominant offensive performances in the NFL during Alexander's career, and his achievements serve as a testament to the importance of teamwork and a strong offensive line in professional football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Output:","completion":"To solve this problem, let's follow these steps: 1. Understand the problem: we are asked to find the greatest two-digit prime-saturated integer. 2. Recall the definition: an integer is prime saturated if the product of its unique positive prime factors is less than the square root of the integer itself. 3. Start checking two-digit integers from the largest (99) and move downwards. 4. Find the unique prime factors of each number and check if the product of these prime factors is less than the square root of the number. 5. Stop when we find a prime saturated number. Step 3: Let's start with the largest two-digit integer, 99. Step 4: Find the unique prime factors of 99: 3, 11 - 3 * 11 = 33 Step 5: Check if the product (33) is less than the square root of 99 (√99 ≈ 9.95). - 33 > 9.95, so 99 is not prime saturated. Incrementally moving downwards, we finally reach number 78. Step 4: Find the unique prime factors of 78: 2, 3, 13 - 2 * 3 * 13 = 78 Step 5: Check if the product (78) is less than the square root of 78 (√78 ≈ 8.83). - 78 > 8.83, so 78 is not prime saturated. Continuing on, we reach 75. Step 4: Find the unique prime factors of 75: 3, 5 - 3 * 5 = 15 Step 5: Check if the product (15) is less than the square root of 75 (√75 ≈ 8.66). - 15 > 8.66, so 75 is not prime saturated. After trying some more cases, we reach the number 50. Step 4: Find the unique prime factors of 50: 2, 5 - 2 * 5 = 10 Step 5: Check if the product (10) is less than the square root of 50 (√50 ≈ 7.07). - 10 > 7.07, so 50 is not prime saturated. Finally, we reach 49. Step 4: Find the unique prime factors of 49: 7 - 7 * 1 = 7 (Since there is only one prime factor, we multiply by 1) Step 5: Check if the product (7) is less than the square root of 49 (√49 = 7). - 7 = 7, so 49 is not prime saturated. Next, we consider 48. Step 4: Find the unique prime factors of 48: 2, 3 - 2 * 3 = 6 Step 5: Check if the product (6) is less than the square root of 48 (√48 ≈ 6.92). - 6 < 6.92, so 48 is prime saturated.

When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \\"sunrooms\\" with artificial lights have been built. People can go there and get \\"sunlight\\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains. Through these ways, the weather can influence our emotions. Sadly, while the weather can change us, we can hardly change the weather. Options: A We feel good when we are in the bright cool weather. B We will be happy when we are caught in the rain. C All people in Norway and Sweden feel sad in winter. D The more vitamin D you have, the happier you'll be. Answer: A We feel good when we are in the bright cool weather. Question: The answer is:","completion":"What factor can influence people's emotions according to the article?

Choosing their words carefully, they might say they tolerated him. Those who churned out hugely popular soaps and television shows thought Syria's president, in his mid-30s when he took power in 2000, wanted to be known as a modern leader who defended free expression. Some said al-Assad even looked the other way when a sketch comedy show aired for several seasons that made fun of corruption in Syria. At worst, many reasoned, the young president wouldn't be anymore hard-line than his father, Hafez Assad, who had long kept a purple-knuckle grip on all media in Syria. He remembers all the talk of change from Syria's new leader in the early 2000s, just as the proliferation of satellite television throughout the region suddenly gave OPTIONS: - Al-Assad access to different entertainment and points of view. - Bashar al-Assad access to different entertainment and points of view. - CNN access to different entertainment and points of view. - Damascus access to different entertainment and points of view. - Hafez Assad access to different entertainment and points of view. - Hatred access to different entertainment and points of view. - Khaled Khalifa access to different entertainment and points of view. - Khalifa access to different entertainment and points of view. - Syria access to different entertainment and points of view. - Syrian access to different entertainment and points of view. - al-Assad access to different entertainment and points of view.","completion":"- Syria access to different entertainment and points of view.

Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

Write an article based on this summary: – \\"Why did you have to shoot?\\" Per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, that's the big question Bill Schultz had Monday at a presser, addressing campus cops at Georgia Tech after his oldest child, 21-year-old Scout Schultz, was shot dead Saturday. Scout, who headed the school's Pride Alliance, was killed after four campus cops responded to a 911 call about someone armed with a weapon. Investigators say Schultz was nearing the cops and didn't comply when told to put down his knife, the AP reports. Per CBS News, a video shows a male officer fired after Schultz said, \\"Shoot me\\" and the officer replied, \\"No, drop the knife,\\" only for Schultz to continue toward the police. Chris Stewart, the Schultzes' attorney, says Scout was holding a utility tool but the blade wasn't out. \\"They overreacted,\\" Stewart tells the Journal-Constitution, adding Schultz seemed to be having a mental breakdown. Schultz's parents agree, with Lynne Schultz telling the paper she didn't understand why nonlethal force, such as pepper spray or stun guns, wasn't used. Stewart, who says the Schultzes plan on filing a civil suit, said Monday he'd confirmed that campus police don't carry those less-lethal alternatives, which he called \\"insane,\\" per CBS. Bill Schultz said Scout had a history of depression—the engineering student had attempted suicide two years ago—but had seemed OK recently and was doing well at Georgia Tech, with a 3.9 GPA and an early graduation date set for December. Lynne Schultz explains to the Journal-Constitution that Scout identified as nonbinary (neither male nor female) and was classified as intersex, having biological or physiological characteristics that are neither fully male nor female. \\"Why did you have to shoot?\\" Bill Schultz asked at the presser. \\"That's the only question that matters right now.\\" Article:","completion":"\\"Why Did You Have to Shoot?\\" That's What Scout's Dad Wants to Know Once upon a time, in a place called Georgia Tech, a sad thing happened. A 21-year-old student named Scout Schultz was shot by the campus police. Scout was the leader of a group called the Pride Alliance at their school. One day, someone made a call that there's a person with a weapon and the campus police came quickly to see. When the police got there, they found Scout holding something sharp, like a knife. The police asked Scout to put it down, but Scout didn't listen. Instead, Scout told the police to \\"shoot me\\" and kept moving towards them. Finally, one of the policemen shot Scout and Scout sadly, didn't survive. Now, Scout's family is very sad and upset because they believe the police did more than what was needed. Their lawyer, named Chris Stewart, says that the sharp thing Scout held wasn't even a knife, and they think Scout was just very upset and needed help. Scout's mom, Lynne Schultz, wondered why the police didn't use something less harmful like pepper spray or stun guns instead of shooting Scout. Later, they found out that the campus police didn't have those less harmful things, which made the lawyer call it \\"insane.\\" Scout was a very smart student, with a 3.9 GPA, and was almost ready to graduate early. But Scout also felt very sad sometimes, and even tried to hurt themselves once before, two years ago.

Zhuyin fuhao (), Zhuyin (), Bopomofo (ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) or Mandarin Phonetic Symbols is the major Chinese transliteration system for Taiwanese Mandarin. It is also used to transcribe other Chinese languages, particularly other varieties of Standard Chinese and related Mandarin dialects, as well as Taiwanese Hokkien. The first two are traditional terms, whereas Bopomofo is the colloquial term, also used by the ISO and Unicode. Consisting of 37 characters and four tone marks, it transcribes all possible sounds in Mandarin. Zhuyin was introduced in China by the Republican Government in the 1910s and used alongside the Wade-Giles system, which used a modified Latin alphabet. The Wade system was replaced by Hanyu Pinyin in 1958 by the Government of the People's Republic of China, and at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1982. Although Taiwan adopted Hanyu Pinyin as its official romanization system in 2009, Bopomofo is still an official transliteration system there and remains widely used as an educational tool and for electronic input methods. The informal name \\"Bopomofo\\" is derived from the first four syllables in the conventional ordering of available syllables in Mandarin Chinese.

Write highlights for this article: TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- With hundreds of protesters gathering and riot police out in force on the streets of Tehran, hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took the oath of office Wednesday, beginning a second term in a bitterly divided Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in Wednesday as Iran's president. He begins his second term. Ahmadinejad, 52, was formally sworn in before Iran's parliament, known as the Majlis, as security forces guarded the building and nearby streets in anticipation of protests. Witnesses reported a heavy police presence -- including members of the pro-government Basij militia -- and several choppers hovering overhead. Some reported protesters, many of them women, sitting in front of the parliament building's entrance. As discontent surfaced yet again, Ahmadinejad vowed to take Iran forward and flung sharp words at those who questioned the validity of the June 12 elections, in which he was declared the winner with almost two-thirds of the vote. He took particular aim at the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Germany, which have not sent formal letters of congratulations to Ahmadinejad. \\"They said they would recognize the election, but will not congratulate,\\" Ahmadinejad said in his inaugural speech. \\"This means they only want democracy at the service of their interests and don't respect the people's vote and rights. \\"Nobody in Iran is waiting for anyone's congratulations,\\" he said. What's next for Iran? ». Asked Tuesday whether the White House recognizes Ahmadinejad as the rightful leader of Iran, press secretary Robert Gibbs said, \\"He's the elected leader.\\" Gibbs expanded on that comment Wednesday, telling reporters \\"It's not for me or for us to denote his legitimacy, except to acknowledge the fact.\\" \\"Whether any election was fair, obviously the Iranian people still have questions about that, and we'll let them decide that,\\" Gibbs said. \\"But I would simply say he's been inaugurated, and we know that is simply a fact.\\" The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since 1980. Britain has maintained ties, but has criticized the Iranian crackdown on protests that followed the disputed election and has not issued a statement of congratulation to Ahmadinejad. However, the British ambassador to Tehran did attend the ceremony, and the Foreign Office in London said the international community still needs to engage Iran on \\"serious issues,\\" such as its nuclear program. \\"While we need to engage with Iran's government, today's ceremony does not change our position on Iran's elections,\\" the Foreign Office said. Among others attending Wednesday's ceremony were Iran's top lawmakers, the heads of the three branches of government, the secretary of the Guardian Council and foreign diplomats. But as the camera of the semi-official Press TV panned the hall, an unprecedented number of empty seats were visible. It was unclear whether opposition leaders were boycotting the inauguration. Ahmadinejad struck a note of unity in his attempt to move Iran forward, saying \\"Who has voted for whom -- this is not the question. Today we need a national resolve. Today we need to join forces.\\" He vowed to promote religion and morality, and support righteousness and spread justice. \\"I will guard the power that the people have entrusted in me as the sacred trust,\\" Ahmadinejad said. \\"I will safeguard it like an honest and faithful trustee.\\" Ahmadinejad, however, starts another four years in office with many Iranians questioning his legitimacy. The results of the June 12 election were widely disputed; Ahmadinejad's chief rival, reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi called the elections a \\"fraud.\\" Since the vote, Iran has seen turmoil not witnessed since the 1979 Islamic revolution as thousands have taken to the streets to protest and security forces have brutally cracked down. Analyst Amir Taheri told CNN Wednesday that Ahmadinejad's second term will be closely watched around the world. Taheri said the freshly inaugurated president faces myriad challenges in his second term, among them a faltering economy and a burgeoning popular movement favoring reform. \\"He has to worry a lot about the opposition,\\" Taheri said. Iran says about 30 people have been killed in the post-election violence. Among those who were arrested, 110 are facing trial, according to Iranian media reports. Under Iran's constitution, the incoming president must receive the supreme leader's approval before being sworn into office. On Monday, after Ayatollah Ali Khameini gave that endorsement to Ahmadinejad, hundreds of Iranians again demonstrated in the Iranian capital. Witnesses and sources said the crowds marched on the sidewalks around Vannak Square and Vali Asr Avenue, under the watchful eye of hundreds of Iranian security forces. Some chanted \\"Death to the dictator,\\" while others said \\"God is great.\\" International media outlets, including CNN, have been restricted in their coverage of Iran in the aftermath of the elections. Highlights:","completion":"1. Hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in for a second term in a divided Iran, amidst heavy protests and riot police presence. 2. Security forces, including the pro-government Basij militia, guarded Iran's parliament during the inauguration, with helicopters patrolling overhead. 3.

Squirt some of the cleanser into a soft bath sponge and then rub it over your back. Try to wash your back for at least a minute so the cleanser can penetrate your skin. Then rinse it off. It's easiest to wash your back while you're in the shower. Wash your back with the cleanser twice a day unless it dries out your skin. If your skin is too dry, wash just once a day. Buy an OTC exfoliant and squirt some of it into a soft bath sponge. Massage the exfoliant into your back for at least a minute and then rinse it off. The gentle exfoliant will help to remove the blackheads on your back. To make it easier to scrub your entire back, try using a scrubber brush that has a long handle. Many products designed to exfoliate blackheads also contain salicylic acid. Apply the cream once a day. Check retinoid cream or gel products to ensure they contain 0.1% adapalene. This will help unclog your pores so it's easier to get rid of blackheads while preventing them from forming. If you have hard to reach blackheads, ask someone to help you spread the cream or gel for you. Rub the cream onto your back after you get out of the shower or before you go to bed. You've probably seen a lot of acne medications that contain benzoyl peroxide which reduce inflammation and treat bacteria that causes acne. Since blackheads aren't caused by bacteria and they don't cause inflammation, benzoyl peroxide won't remove your blackheads. If you have acne on your back that's causing pimples, cysts, or pustules, the benzoyl peroxide would help by removing the bacteria that's causing them. If you have a lot of blackheads that aren't responding to skin care products, talk with the dermatologist about microdermabrasion. The technician will drag a small machine over your back that sprays very tiny crystals over your skin. The machine also sucks up the crystals and dead cells from the surface of your skin. Your skin will be smoother and feel softer after the microdermabrasion.","completion":"The article provides guidance on using OTC acne cleansers, exfoliants, and retinoid creams to effectively treat and prevent blackheads on the back, while also discussing the limitations of benzoyl peroxide and the potential benefits of microdermabrasion for persistent cases."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Usage: In the given problem, the question is \\"Which one will be slower to accelerate?\\" This is asking which horse will have a slower acceleration based on the information given in the sentence. Part #3: Identify answer options. Usage: In the given problem, the answer options are (A) horse one and (B) horse 2. These are the potential answers to the question that needs to be evaluated based on the information provided. Part #4: Evaluate the answer options. Usage: Based on the information given, horse one has to carry 10 pounds more food than horse 2, while both horses are equally strong. As increased weight would cause slower acceleration, horse one will be slower to accelerate. Therefore, the answer is (A) horse one, which meets the criteria as it provides the correct answer based on the information given in the sentence and the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no;","completion":"Based on the statement provided, it appears that there is a preference for events to start at seven and end at ten, as opposed to starting at eight and ending at eleven. To better understand and address this preference, let's break down and analyze the given statement. The initial part of the statement, \\"If which is which is strange I mean because yours start at seven and end at ten,\\" seems to express confusion or curiosity about the difference in schedules between the speaker and the person they are addressing. The speaker believes that having events start at seven and finish at ten is a more appropriate or preferable option, though the reason for this preference is not explicit. The next part of the statement, \\"and ours start at at at at at eight and end at eleven,\\" reinforces the point that there is a difference in timings between the two parties being discussed. This suggests that the speaker and their associates follow a different schedule than the person being addressed, with events that run from eight to eleven. The final part of the statement, \\"that's why we i I would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten,\\" conveys the speaker's desire to have their schedule align with the one followed by the person they are addressing. The speaker believes that starting events an hour earlier and finishing them an hour earlier offers some advantage, though this advantage is not directly mentioned. Now, let us rephrase the statement in a clearer manner: \\"I don't like that ours starts at eight and doesn't finish until eleven because it's too late. I would prefer if events started at seven and ended at ten.\\" Considering the statement in its entirety, we can conclude that the answer to the question is: (1) Yes. The speaker expresses a preference for a schedule that begins at seven and concludes at ten. They imply that events starting at eight and ending at eleven are too late for their liking, which could be influenced by factors such as personal commitments, work or school schedules, or simply a preference for earlier hours. Conclusively, the speaker's desire to adopt a schedule that starts at seven and ends at ten arises from their dissatisfaction with their current schedule beginning at eight and finishing at eleven."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What medium of communication does That Darn Cat and Miracle have in common? Answer:","completion":"That Darn Cat and Miracle are two distinct movies, each hailing from different genres and focusing on diverse themes. However, upon closer examination of these two films, we can identify the medium of communication they share in common: both movies rely on the visual and auditory medium offered by the cinematic platform. \\"That Darn Cat\\" is a comedy-mystery film, first produced by Walt Disney Productions in 1965 and later remade in 1997. The story revolves around an adventurous cat that helps solve a kidnapping case. At the heart of this film lies the visual and auditory experience that cinema provides. These elements engage the audience and allow them to indulge in a sense of escapism while appreciating the film's humor and storyline. As a film, \\"That Darn Cat\\" depends on the visuals, dialogues, music, and sound effects to create its desired atmosphere and keep the viewers entertained. On the other hand, \\"Miracle\\" is a sports drama film released in 2004, chronicling the United States men's national ice hockey team's journey to win the 1980 Winter Olympics gold medal. Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, \\"Miracle\\" incorporates elements of patriotism, passion, and hard work to showcase the team's dedication and drive. Similar to \\"That Darn Cat,\\" \\"Miracle\\" employs the visual and auditory aspects of cinema: the dynamic visuals, inspiring dialogues, carefully chosen music, and sound effects all work in synergy to emphasize the emotional weight and tension embedded within the film. In conclusion, although \\"That Darn Cat\\" and \\"Miracle\\" are distinctly different in terms of genre, plot, and themes, they share a common medium of communication through the visual and auditory experiences that cinema brings to life. Both films rely on this medium to convey their respective messages and to engage, entertain, and captivate their audiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: James thought that giving the AI a secular upbringing would be the better choice. He felt that the alternative might have results that were too what? - eternal - religious - unpredictable - holy - monastic The best answer is Answer:","completion":"James thought that giving the AI a secular upbringing would be the better choice. He felt that the alternative might have results that were too unpredictable. A secular upbringing for an AI would involve providing it with non-religious, rational, and scientific principles to guide its learning and development. This choice is considered more reliable by James because it ensures that the AI would function based on a well-defined, unbiased, and inclusive system of values drawn from diverse cultural, moral, and ethical sources. On the other hand, a religious or spiritual upbringing for an AI could lead to unpredictable results. This is because religious or spiritual ideologies can vary significantly from one another, and their interpretation can also be highly subjective, depending on the individual and the specific belief system. Teaching an AI to rely on certain religious or spiritual principles might cause it to make decisions difficult to predict since it would align with specific values and beliefs exclusive to that particular religion or philosophical standpoint. This might make the AI less adaptable, open, and compassionate to the vast array of diverse perspectives present in today's interconnected world. Furthermore, other possible alternatives like giving the AI a holy or monastic upbringing would only serve to magnify the aforementioned issues, confining the AI's perspectives and thought processes within a narrow set of ideologies. An eternal upbringing, on the other hand, could be argued as not even being an actual upbringing as the term \\"eternal\\" does not refer to any specific guiding principles or values. Consequently, it could lead to a highly unpredictable AI with no apparent direction in terms of moral, ethical, or intellectual growth. In conclusion, James believed that providing an AI with a secular upbringing would be the better choice, as it would minimize its chances of becoming unpredictable and help it thrive in a world where rationality, inclusivity, and diversity of thoughts and beliefs are valued and celebrated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. At times your teen may be difficult to handle, but it's important to remember that they are dealing with a lot. Their hormones and body are changing, which can cause mood swings. They are also trying to more fully develop their identity, and may be dealing with pressures from school or their friends. When disciplining your teen, it's key to consider the context. Have they been rude and moody lately? Try to figure out if something outside the house is bothering them. Have you noticed their best friend doesn't stop by as often? Consider that your teen might be going through a stressful time and try to cut them a little slack. Are their grades slipping? Take a few days to watch their habits. Teens need a lot of sleep, so maybe you need to help them get more rest so they can better concentrate. Before deciding on discipline, consider all of the components of the situation. Being empathetic means that you are thinking about, or sensitive to, what someone else is feeling or thinking. When disciplining your teen, try to place yourself in their shoes. When choosing the right course of action, take their emotions into consideration. If your son or daughter reacts badly to not being allowed to go on a road trip with friends, try to think about what they are feeling. They are likely worried about being teased, or are maybe suffering from fear of missing out. You don't need to back down on the rules you've set, but you can offer compassion. Try saying, \\"I imagine you're feeling pretty frustrated that you won't be going with your friends. Is there something else fun that you and I could do this weekend instead?\\" Dealing with a teen can be difficult. You might feel stressed, tired, and overwhelmed. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Maybe you have a trusted family member who can offer some advice on how to relate to your teen. Try talking to other parents. It's useful to know what your son or daughter's friends are allowed to do. You can try asking their parents about curfew, allowance, etc. to get an idea of the types of policies you want to set. Your teen's doctor can be a great resource, too. They can ensure that your son or daughter stays physically and emotionally healthy. At regular check ups, they can also rule out any medical problems and offer up outside resources. Summary:","completion":"Teens can be difficult sometimes because they are going through many changes in their body and life, like growing and dealing with school or friends. When you need to talk to them about their behavior, try to think about what they might be feeling or going through. Be kind and try to understand their feelings, even if you still need to make them follow the rules. It's okay to ask for help from other people, like family, other parents, or even your teen's doctor, to understand your teen better and help them be healthy and happy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Invest in Jewish-Italian delicatessen The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Delicious Returns\\" Harry Roberts is a mild-mannered, middle-aged accountant from Long Island, New York. He wins a significant amount in the Mega Millions Lottery Jackpot - 100 million to be exact - which he procured from a weathered envelope found in the attic of his childhood home. With no note or indication of the owner, the ticket simply read: \\"May this be your lucky day, Harry.\\" After a lot of contemplation about what to do with the money, Harry recalls his grandfather mentioning his two greatest passions: the family's Jewish-Italian heritage and his love for food. With this in mind, Harry decides to invest in a Jewish-Italian delicatessen in New York. Step 1: Roberts hires Susan, a strong, passionate, recently unemployed lady with excellent business acumen to run the store. Together, they negotiate the lease for a shop at a prime location in New York City, sign agreements, and start the redesigning process with a blend of Jewish and Italian architectural aesthetics. Step 2: They work tirelessly to hire skilled chefs knowledgeable in Jewish-Italian cuisine. They also establish partnerships with local organic farmers to secure fresh ingredients for their menu. Step 3: The grand opening of the delicatessen, \\"Roberto's Deli,\\" is a resounding success, with its unique blending of Jewish and Italian flavors becoming an instant hit. The deli also organizes food festivals, conducts cooking workshops and hosts special holiday meals, adding to its popularity. There are challenges along the way - sometimes the expenditure is higher than the returns, competition is tough with a famous chain opening right next door, and a potential love interest between Harry and Susan adds complexity. However, Harry's investment proves fruitful in a way he never imagined. Besides making a good profit, his deli becomes a community hub, rivets a torn apart community together and also revives the dying Jewish-Italian cuisine. The climax reveals that the lottery ticket was a last gift from his grandfather, who wanted him to do something extraordinary with his life. From an ordinary accountant to a successful business owner and a community figure, the story wraps with an inspired Harry who has not merely made an investment with his money but built something unforgettable. This concept not only ties nicely with the given plot point but also allows for a mix of drama, comedy, and a few heartfelt moments, making the story much more complex and entertaining."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize the following: Holding your breath deprives your brain of oxygen. Your body is used to a steady flow of fresh oxygen; indeed, you need to breathe it almost constantly to survive. If you hold your breath, you deprive yourself of oxygen, and your brain quickly descends into \\"crisis mode\\". If you hold your breath until you feel uncomfortable—even for just a matter of seconds—you will be able to make yourself lightheaded. Don't hold your breath for too long, or you might pass out. Whatever you do, do not deprive yourself of oxygen in a way that you can't manually override. You're playing with your life here. Only hold your breath if you are able to resume breathing again at a moment's notice. This means: Do not seal your head inside an airtight container, like a bag or a plastic wrap. Certainly don't plug your nose and your mouth at the same time. You run a high risk of suffocating. Do not try to make yourself lightheaded underwater. If you pass out underwater, you might not be able to bring yourself to the surface – and you might drown. Do not try to make yourself lightheaded while you're doing anything that requires your full attention. Don't do this while riding a bike or driving a car. Don't do this while standing on the edge of a high place. You might crash; you might fall. Your vision may go dark, and your brain may feel temporarily empty. The sensation might be overwhelming; you might even pass out. Don't try to walk until your head clears.

I believe that by monitoring how long lead-times are and change it can give one a feeling on how supply is matching up to demand. It can also give some indication on how much sales may occur in the March quarter since it appears that Apple remains fairly supply constrained and this is before any meaningful channel fill occurs. Different lead-times for the various models and memory sizes can give an indication of which ones are in higher demand and what the iPhone’s average selling price (ASP) could be. Another factor in ASPs is how much Apple charges in other countries. I believe that Apple could hit 70 million iPhone sales in the December quarter and the demand for them can be seen in their leading positions they hold in Japan, lead-times being longer than other iPhone launches, China Mobile China Mobile’s 4G customer base exploding and Kantar’s data showing iPhones gaining share worldwide. Source: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images Apple’s iPhone worldwide websites lead-times The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus lead-times have decreased over the past two weeks on the 10 Apple websites that I checked on Friday evening (9 of the original 10 initial launch countries and China). The 16GB and 32GB models have dropped from 5-7 or 7-10 business days to 3-5 days (except for the Space Gray 16GB model in Australia that is at 1-3 business days). The iPhone 6 128GB models have kept their same lead-times from two weeks ago of either 5-7 or 7-10 business days. The 6 Plus 128GB models have seen their lead-times decrease from 3-4 weeks to match the model 6’s 5-7 or 7-10 business days.","completion":"The lead times for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus still remain longer than previous models 11 weeks after their initial launch in the first wave of ten countries. Apple has announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available in a total of 69 countries, with the company aiming to reach 115 by the end of the year. By tracking the lead times, analysts can monitor supply-demand matchups, which can provide an estimation of sales for the next quarter. It is believed that the longer lead times are indicative of the high demand for the smartphones, and Apple could potentially hit 70 million iPhone sales in the December quarter. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are leading in Japan, and Kantar's data shows iPhones are gaining market share worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A. desk B. grocery shop C. house D. antique store E. discount store The best answer is Answer:","completion":"E. Discount Store When looking to buy a cheap book, the best place to consider is a discount store (Option E). There are several reasons why discount stores are the ideal choice for purchasing low-priced books: 1. Affordable Pricing: Discount stores specialize in offering products at lower prices than regular retail stores. They can provide books at a lower cost due to various factors, such as purchasing in bulk, product overruns, or selling last season's merchandise. 2. Wide selection of genres: You will find a broad range of book selections at a discount store, spanning various genres like fiction, non-fiction, children's books, cookbooks, and more. This wide assortment of books means you are likely to find the book you are looking for at an affordable price. 3. Sales and Promotions: Discount stores often hold seasonal sales and promotions that further reduce the cost of books. You can score a great deal during these events, making it possible to buy multiple books at a fraction of their original price. 4. Clearance Items: In addition to regular sales and promotions, discount stores may also have clearance sections where book prices are drastically reduced to make room for new inventory. This is another excellent opportunity to buy cheap books. 5. Used Books: Some discount stores also sell used books, which can be significantly cheaper than new ones. Used books might have minor wear and tear but are generally in good condition and perfect for readers looking for budget-friendly options. However, it is essential to note that while answer D, 'Antique Store,' may not seem like the best choice for a cheap book, there might be instances where you can find rare or out-of-print books at comparatively lower prices than online retailers or specialty bookstores.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state.

Its source is in the Aroania mountains, near the village of Priolithos. It flows past the towns of Kalavryta and Diakopto, and flows into the Gulf of Corinth near Diakopto. Its length is 40 km. The name is derived from Boura, a mythological daughter of Ion and Helice who was beloved by Hercules, who according to legend opened the gorge in order to get close to her. This is the Vouraikos gorge, which has a length of about 20 km. In the gorge the river passes through dense vegetation and tunnels with many caves, passes and crags. - The Peloponnese or Peloponnesus (\\"Pelopónnsos\\"), is a peninsula and geographic region in southern Greece.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Kalavryta is a town and a municipality in the mountainous east-central part of the regional unit of Achaea, Greece. The town is located on the right bank of the river Vouraikos, south of Aigio, southeast of Patras and northwest of Tripoli.

Step 2: Identify key areas of collaboration and potential challenges I will identify the main areas in which the US and India have collaborated during Trump's administration, such as trade, defense, and foreign policy, as well as any potential obstacles that might have emerged during this period.

Here is an article: By Anthony Breznican, USA TODAY There was less consensus on what kind of movie it was. Some described it as a coming-of-age drama. Others said it was a modern Western. More commonly, critics called it a twist on the classic detective story. The story of a teenage girl struggling to survive in the Ozark Mountains while searching for her missing father won Sundance's Grand Jury prize as well as best screenplay, settling it as one of the festival's top discoveries. The broader moviegoing public now gets to weigh in on this film's genre-fusion when Winter's Bone opens in limited release Friday and expands nationwide over the next two weeks. Director Debra Granik embraces all the different takes on her story and credits Daniel Woodrell, author of the original novel, for weaving together so many storytelling elements. \\"It's definitely a mystery in the sense that she has something to solve,\\" Granik says. \\"It's an amalgam really. Daniel was drawing on some irresistible forms of American storytelling. The Western — it's absolutely that in the sense that here's this person who has something very solid she's fighting for and needs to protect. She's met with a hostile response. She's warned. She's told to turn back. She's crossing a line, but she has to go further. But she needs to get to the end.\\" The \\"she\\" is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), and what she needs to protect are her much-younger brother and sister, her ailing mother and their modest home. Her deadbeat father, a meth dealer who is facing a long prison sentence, put the property up as his bail bond, then promptly disappeared. The police inform her that if he doesn't show up for court, she can add homelessness to her litany of troubles, which already include being a too-soon parental guardian, nursemaid and breadwinner for the family. She'll not only have to locate him but also persuade him to turn himself in. Her quest takes even darker turns. The host of grim-faced friends and relatives scattered across the wilderness of her community are strangely resistant to helping her. If she persists, she may be the next one to vanish. But Ree keeps asking. \\"It didn't really seem like a detective story until I heard other people saying 'detective story.' And then I was like, 'Yeah. Sure! It's a detective story,' \\" Lawrence jokes. \\"It's hard because movies can affect every single person differently. But that's what movies are for.\\" In fact, the many interpretations of Winter's Bone have become a strength and a kind of Rorschach test for each viewer. \\"What Winter's Bone does is really focus in on making (the characters) seem like real individuals. The story is patient, and it's beautifully shot in such a way that it makes you feel like you're in this environment, and a lot of people are able to project what they want that story to be, because it feels so real to them,\\" says Eric Kohn, lead film critic for IndieWire.com, who says he saw it as a kind of film noir. \\"It's all of those things and works on all those different levels, because you're not being told you have to look at this movie in one particular way.\\" The film started out as more of a character study, a look at the world of a teenager who is forced too soon into adulthood with too little means. \\"There was a late-breaking embracing of these terms we're using now,\\" Granik says. \\"It wasn't really until the editing that we saw the film had palpable suspense. \\"It was a little bit of a trade-off because we had more content from her daily life in the film initially. ... In some ways, suspense becomes a very strict mistress, what she will and won't allow in a film.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife.

Title: Night of the Comet Movie plot: The Earth is passing through the tail of a comet, an event which has not occurred in 65 million years. The last time coinciding with the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. On the night of the comet's passage, which takes place eleven days before Christmas, large crowds gather outside to watch and celebrate. 18-year-old Regina \\"Reggie\\" Belmont works at a movie theater in southern California. She is annoyed to find the initials DMK have the sixth highest score on the theater's arcade game on which all the other scores are hers. She stays after the theater closes to play until DMK's score is removed and have sex with her boyfriend Larry, the theater projectionist, in the steel-lined projection booth. Meanwhile, Reggie's 16-year-old sister Samantha \\"Sam\\" argues with their stepmother Doris, who punches her in the face. Sam then spends the night in a steel backyard shed. The next morning, a reddish haze covers everything, and there are no signs of life, only piles of red dust and heaps of clothing. Unaware that anything strange has happened, Larry goes outside and is killed by a zombie wielding a pipe wrench. When Reggie goes looking for Larry, she encounters the zombie, but escapes. She heads home to find her sister. Because both Reggie and Sam spent the night shielded from cosmic effects by steel, they were saved from the comet's effects.[3] After figuring out what has happened, they hear a disc jockey and race to the radio station, only to find it was just a recording. They come across another survivor there, Hector Gomez, who spent the night in the back of his steel truck. When Sam talks into the microphone, she is heard by researchers in an underground installation out in the desert. As they listen to Reggie, Sam and Hector debate what to do, the scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet, will eventually disintegrate into dust themselves. Hector leaves to see if any of his family survived, but promises to come back. Reggie and Sam then go shopping at a mall. After a...

Change of environment: Cats are sensitive to changes in their environment and need time to adjust. Moving the cats to the main part of the house changed their surroundings, which could have caused them to feel uneasy at first. 2. Territory: Cats are territorial animals and may feel threatened or uneasy when moved to a new area. They need time to establish and claim the space as their own before feeling comfortable. 3. Presence of unfamiliar smells: When the cats were moved to the main part of the house, they would have encountered unfamiliar smells. Cats rely on their sense of smell for security, and new scents can be disconcerting. 4. Transition period: It is common for cats to need a transition period when adjusting to new environments. As mentioned, after a day, they were totally comfortable with the new place, indicating they just needed some time to acclimate.

This is about winning the electoral college, not national polls. National tracking polls are overrated. They were overrated when they had President Obama leading the race and they are overrated now that some polls are showing Mitt Romney ahead. There is no polling conspiracy. It’s all about perspective: The race for the White House is going to be very close and the tracking polls are going to swing back and forth for the next three weeks until election day. Today, there are two national tracking polls out that have everyone talking. First, Gallup has a seven-day tracking poll that has President Obama up five points. This differs from their three-day tracking poll that had the race tied, with both candidates 47% each -- but that didn't include polling from Sunday, when the President appeared to be rebounding. In any event, it is clear that Mitt Romney got a bounce from his \\"winning\\" performance in the first presidential debate, but the jury is still out as to whether Team Romney can turn that bounce into real momentum. Second, Pew released the first tracking poll taken completely after Obama’s dismal performance in the debate. In that, Romney is leading the race nationally by four points. It’s a shift of 12 points in favor of Romney from the last Pew poll in mid-September after the successful Democratic convention. And so begins the liberal freak out. Is that real momentum for Team Romney or is the Pew poll an outlier? The truth is that it doesn't really matter. The election is going to be close. In my previous posts, when I proclaimed Romney to be losing, I was always talking in terms of the electoral college estimates, which still show the President winning projected totals of over 300 votes, way over the 270 votes needed to win. This is about Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Iowa. This is about the battleground states. It is a fact that Romney has a much tougher road to get to 270 than does the President. Team Romney needs to run a flawless campaign and get out the vote operation in order to get to 270. It’s the electoral math that is in the President’s favor, and until that changes, tracking polls will shift the media narrative but not much else.","completion":"The article argues that national tracking polls, which show fluctuating leads for Obama and Romney, are overrated and do not predict the actual election outcome.

Context: I woke at dawn when Digger climbed over me to get out of bed, and I woke again an hour later when Pa called, \\"Everyone up who wants breakfast!\\" Across the room, Little Bit was dressing in a T-shirt and jeans that had been mine a year before. Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in. Squeezing toothpaste onto my toothbrush, I said, \\"I wasn't done yet.\\" Ma said, \\"Your father's making breakfast in the restaurant.\\" That meant we should hurry, so I slid the brush over my teeth while Little Bit sat next to the sink, and then I ran out of the house.

Given the question: Information: - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Wayne ( born Cliffroy Taylor , Portmore , Jamaica ) , is a roots reggae singer . He is known for his hit singles \`\` Living In Love '' and \`\` Ca n't Satisfy Her '' from his debut album , Lava Ground . - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Rastafari is a religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. Its adherents worship him in much the same way as Jesus in his Second Advent, or as God the Son. Members of the Rastafari way of life are known as Rastafari, Rastas, or simply Ras. Rastafari are also known by their official church titles, such as Elder or High Priest. The way of life is sometimes referred to as \\"Rastafarianism\\", but this term is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of \\"isms\\" or \\"ians\\" (which they see as a typical part of \\"Babylon\\" culture), dislike being labelled as an \\"ism\\" or \\"ian\\" themselves. Rastafari has always been conceived as a way of life for and by people of African descent. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Jah or Yah (\\"Yahu\\") is a short form of Yahweh (in consonantal spelling YHWH , called the Tetragrammaton), the proper name of God in the Hebrew Bible. This short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase \\"Hallelujah\\". - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - Lava Ground is the debut album from Jamaican reggae artist I Wayne. The album features guest appearances from Fire Chess, Harmony and Fire Star. As well as production from P. Henry, M.Miller, O. Hibbert etc. The album includes the hits \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\". - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - I Wayne, Rastafarian stage name for Cliffroy Taylor (born 1980 in Portmore, Jamaica), is a roots reggae singer. He is known for his hit singles \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\" from his debut album, \\"Lava Ground\\". - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.

We could see smoke rising on the mountain, but not over the field. We figured the fire was subsiding on the","completion":"lower ground, while still fiercely burning higher up. Uncertain about the extent of the damage, we gathered our emergency supplies, including water, food, a flashlight, and a first aid kit. Step 1: Assess the situation Given the smoke rising from the mountain and the lack of visible smoke over the field, our first step was to make an educated guess regarding the magnitude of the fire and its potential danger. Having noted the fire's subsidence at lower ground, we assumed the more immediate danger lay higher up the mountain. Reasoning: Understanding the potential risk of the fire helps us determine our best course of action. Step 2: Prepare for evacuation To avoid being caught unprepared, we collected essential emergency supplies, such as water, food, a flashlight, and a first aid kit. These items would be crucial in case we needed to evacuate or aid anyone injured in the fire. Reasoning: Collecting essential supplies is an important precautionary measure in emergencies. Step 3: Gather information To gather more information about the fire, we turned on the radio, hoping to catch any updates from local authorities or news agencies. We sought guidance on evacuations, road closures, and the fire's current status. Simultaneously, we tried contacting nearby neighbors to see if they were aware of the fire and had any additional information to share. Reasoning: Obtaining accurate information would help us gauge the severity of the fire, allowing us to act accordingly. Step 4: Formulate a plan Based on the information received, we mapped out possible escape routes from our location, considering road closures and avoiding areas close to the fire. We also designated a meeting point for our family in case of separation during an evacuation. Reasoning: Having a plan ready ensures that we can effectively respond to the situation in a timely manner and increases our chances of staying safe. Step 5: Monitor the situation We continually monitored the fire's progress, either through observing the smoke, listening to updates on the radio, or maintaining communication with neighbors. This allowed us to stay informed about any changes in the situation, such as the fire's spread or containment efforts, and adjust our plans accordingly. Reasoning: Constantly monitoring the situation ensures that we can react quickly to any changes, increasing our chances of staying safe. Step 6: Act on our plan If the fire approached our location or an evacuation order was issued, we would put our plan into action, grabbing our emergency supplies, following our predetermined escape route, and heading to the designated meeting point. This would help ensure our safety and that of our family members. Reasoning: Acting on a well-thought-out plan, even under pressure, is crucial for effective crisis management. As we continued to watch the smoke rise on the mountain, we stayed vigilant, prepared to react to any updates on the fire or shifts in the situation.

Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory. Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage? - Information in short-term memory is different from that in long-term memory. - Long-term memory can be achieved only by training. - It is easier to test short-term memory than long term memory. - Henning gave a separate test on vocabulary to his students.

If you want GOOD end of the world themed books you should try the Fire-us trilogy. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a predominantly negative sentiment towards the book in question. The reviewer starts by expressing uncertainty in the title with \\"err.....\\" which suggests that they might have struggled to find a concise or accurate way to describe the book. Moreover, the reviewer mentions that the book is comparable to many others, which implies that it lacks originality or any distinct features that would set it apart from other books in the genre. Furthermore, the reviewer emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the portrayal of the characters' emotions, stating that they \\"just don't speak to me.\\" This highlights a disconnect between the reader and the characters, potentially making it difficult for the reviewer to engage with the story or empathize with the characters' experiences. By characterizing the book as \\"a kind of uniform,\\" the reviewer reinforces the idea that the book is generic and fails to stand out from the crowd. Interestingly, the review includes a recommendation for other books in the same end-of-the-world theme, suggesting the Fire-us trilogy as a more enjoyable alternative. This recommendation not only reinforces the negative sentiment towards the book being reviewed but also serves as a contrasting example of what the reviewer considers to be a \\"GOOD\\" representation of the theme.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To choose a pot for growing plants, Available choices: a. make sure the pot has a hole on the bottom of it.. b. make sure the pot has no holes on the bottom of it..","completion":"To determine the better solution for choosing a pot for growing plants, let us examine the pros and cons of both options: Option A: Make sure the pot has a hole on the bottom of it. Pros: 1. Improved drainage: A pot with a hole at the bottom allows excess water to drain from the soil, preventing waterlogging and root rot in the plants. 2. Prevents over-watering: Having a drainage hole helps to prevent over-watering by ensuring that excess water will not remain in the pot, which can harm the plants' roots. 3. Regulates moisture levels: Drainage holes help maintain a balance between moisture and air in the soil, resulting in better overall plant health. 4. Avoids mineral buildup: Holes at the bottom of the pot prevent the accumulation of salts and minerals in the soil, which can cause toxicity or nutrient imbalances for the plants. 5. Provides plants with oxygen: A pot with holes ensures proper oxygen supply to the plant roots, contributing to their growth and vigor. Cons: 1. Potential mess: A pot with drainage holes can create a mess if placed directly on surfaces without a saucer or tray underneath it, as water can spill over and damage the surface. 2. Requires regular watering: A pot with holes may need more frequent watering due to improved drainage, which can cause the soil to dry out more quickly. Option B: Make sure the pot has no holes on the bottom of it. Pros: 1. No mess: Pots without holes create no mess when they are watered, as there will be no leakage or spillage of water onto surfaces. 2. Less frequent watering: With no drainage holes, the soil retains moisture for a longer period, requiring less frequent watering. Cons: 1. Poor drainage and root rot: A pot without holes can cause waterlogging in the soil, which leads to saturated roots that rot and die. 2. Over-watering risk: A pot without holes increases the chances of accidentally over-watering the plants, which can be harmful to their root systems and overall health. 3. Mineral buildup: Without proper drainage, salts and minerals can accumulate in the soil, causing toxicity and nutrient imbalances. 4. Limited oxygen supply: Pots without holes often result in poor oxygen supply to the roots, leading to weak growth. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of both options, it can be concluded that Option A, a pot with a hole on the bottom, is the better choice for growing plants. It provides improved drainage, prevents over-watering, regulates moisture levels, avoids mineral buildup, and offers better oxygen supply to plant roots. Although it may require more frequent watering and the use of a saucer to prevent mess, the benefits to plant health significantly outweigh these minor inconveniences. On the other hand, Option B, a pot with no holes on the bottom, may have some advantages in terms of maintenance, but it ultimately poses more risks to plant health due to poor drainage, increased chance of over-watering, and limited oxygen supply to the roots."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:For years campaigners have said cancer rates in some villages near factories and polluted waterways have shot up. But the term \\"cancer village\\" has no technical definition and the ministry's report did not elaborate on it. There have been many calls for China to be more transparent on pollution. The latest report from the environment ministry is entitled \\"Guard against and control risks presented by chemicals to the environment during the 12th Five-Year period (2011-2015)\\". It says that the widespread production and consumption of harmful chemicals forbidden in many developed nations are still found in China. \\"The toxic chemicals have caused many environmental emergencies linked to water and air pollution,\\" it said. The report goes on to acknowledge that such chemicals could pose a long-term risk to human health, making a direct link to the so-called \\"cancer villages\\". \\"There are even some serious cases of health and social problems like the emergence of cancer villages in individual regions,\\" it said. The BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says that as China has experienced rapid development, stories about so-called cancer villages have become more frequent. And China has witnessed growing public anger over air pollution and industrial waste caused by industrial development. Media coverage of conditions in these so-called \\"cancer villages\\" has been widespread. In 2009, one Chinese journalist published a map identifying dozens of apparently affected villages. In 2007 the BBC visited the small hamlet of Shangba in southern China where one scientist was studying the cause and effects of pollution on the village. He found high levels of poisonous heavy metals in the water and believed there was a direct connection between incidences of cancer and mining in the area. Until now, there has been little comment from the government on such allegations. Environmental lawyer Wang Canfa, who runs a pollution aid centre in Beijing, told the AFP news agency that it was the first time the \\"cancer village\\" phrase had appeared in a ministry document. Last month - Beijing - and several other cities - were blanketed in smog that soared past levels considered hazardous by the World Health Organisation. The choking pollution provoked a public outcry and led to a highly charged debate about the costs of the country's rapid economic development, our correspondent says.

Possible answers: (i). yes. (ii). it is not possible to tell. (iii). no.","completion":"(i). Yes. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) weights to compute an estimate of the aggregate US population demand function for postage from the household sector is a valid approach. BLS weights are designed to be representative of the entire US population, which makes them useful in obtaining aggregate household demand functions. The BLS collects extensive data on consumer spending habits and consumer price index (CPI) weights through the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). The CEX captures the spending patterns of a representative sample of US households, making it possible to construct estimates of aggregate demand for various goods and services, including postage. By combining individual household-level demand functions and applying BLS weights, we can arrive at an estimate of the overall demand function for postage. This aggregate demand function accounts for variations in demographic and socio-economic factors across the US population, leading to a more accurate reflection of the nation's demand for postage. Once we have the aggregate demand function, we can compute own-price and cross-price elasticities of aggregate household demand for postage. The own-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in the price of postage, while cross-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in the prices of related goods and services, such as electronic communication or courier services. In conclusion, we can confidently say that \\"The demand for postage can be calculated by using BLS weights.\\" This approach allows us to account for the diverse preferences and spending patterns across the US population while obtaining a reliable estimate of the aggregate demand function for postage, which can then be used to analyze own-price and cross-price elasticities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What's a sentence that uses these characters?","completion":"To perform the task of describing what a Schubert lied sounds like when played on carillon, guitar, or crystal glasses, and then creating a sentence using those characters, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the elements in the task. - A Schubert lied is a song composed by Franz Schubert, a 19th-century Austrian composer. Schubert lieder are typically known for their expressive melodies and sensitive piano accompaniment, often setting Romantic German poetry to music. - Carillon is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 bells, typically housed in a bell tower or belfry. Carillons produce a rich, resonant sound that can be heard over great distances. - Guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is usually played by plucking or strumming the strings with fingers, or using a pick. - Crystal glasses are glasses made of highly transparent, colorless glass that have a high-pitched, clear, and ringing sound when rubbed or struck. Step 2: Describe the characteristics of a Schubert lied played on each of these instruments. - Carillon: A Schubert lied played on carillon would have a rich, resonant sound with a deep, bell-like quality. The melody would be more pronounced, and the harmonic structure and intricate piano accompaniments would be less distinct due to the nature of the carillon. - Guitar: A Schubert lied played on guitar would have a warm and intimate sound, with more emphasis on the melody and harmony. The finger-plucked strings would give the music a delicate and expressive quality that could capture the emotional nuances of the original composition. - Crystal glasses: A Schubert lied played on crystal glasses would have a delicate, ethereal, and ringing sound. The melodies would be more prominent while the underlying harmonic structure would be less intricate due to the limitations of the instrument. Step 3: Create a sentence using the characters carillon, guitar, and crystal glasses. \\"Inspired by the deep, resonant tones of the carillon, the warm, expressive melodies of the guitar, and the ethereal ringing of the crystal glasses, the musician sought to create a unique rendition of the Schubert lied that captured the essence of each instrument.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"B. Assembling your tent will be fastest if you don't have to unpack each item one at a time. Keep all parts nestled in one place so you can keep account of everything. Assembling a tent efficiently and effectively requires organization and a plan for ensuring you have everything you need nearby. Unpacking each item one at a time can be tedious and time-consuming. To avoid this and ensure a smooth assembly process, keep all parts of the tent together in one place while you set up. This will help you keep track of everything and will make the assembly process more manageable. To assemble a tent, follow these detailed steps: 1. Choose a level, dry, and preferably elevated area in the site where you want to set up the camp. Avoid areas with rocks, roots, and uneven ground to ensure a comfortable night's sleep. 2. Lay out the tent's footprint or groundsheet. This will act as an additional layer of protection between the tent and the ground. Make sure it's aligned with the direction you want your tent facing. 3. Assemble the tent poles by connecting the individual segments. Most tents will have two main poles that cross each other to create an X-shape. 4. Lay out the tent body on top of the footprint or groundsheet. Make sure the door is aligned with the direction you want to face and that the corners of the tent are aligned with the corners of the footprint. 5. Attach the tent poles to the tent body. This is usually done by inserting the ends of the poles into grommets or sleeves on the corners of the tent. Fasten any clips or hooks along the length of the poles to secure the tent body to the frame. 6. Attach the rainfly to the tent. Drape it over the tent body and poles, making sure it's correctly aligned with the doors and windows. Attach the rainfly to the corner poles or grommets using straps, buckles, or Velcro, depending on your tent's design. 7. Secure the tent to the ground by staking down the corners of the tent and rainfly. Use tent stakes to anchor each corner and any additional guylines. Angle the stakes away from the tent and use a mallet or a rock to drive them into the ground firmly. 8. Tighten any guylines to ensure they are taut and secure. This will provide additional stability to the tent in case of strong winds or rain. 9. Finally, check the tent for any gaps, loose areas, or issues that could affect its performance during your camping trip. Address any issues before proceeding with setting up the rest of your campsite. Setting up the tent efficiently involves having all your materials and tools in one place, so you can assemble without wasting time searching for individual items.

President Donald Trump’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr. declined to discuss with lawmakers on Wednesday a conversation he had with his father about emails related to a June 2016 meeting he attended with Trump associates and Russians a congressional panel member said. Representative Adam Schiff the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee investigating allegations of Russian interference in last year’s U.S. election said Trump Jr. answered the “overwhelming majority” of questions from committee members in his hours of testimony. But Trump Jr. claimed attorney-client privilege in declining to respond to queries about that discussion with his father because a lawyer was in the room when it took place. The discussion between then-Republican candidate Trump and his son took place after the emails became public Schiff said. Trump Jr. released the emails in July. Representative Mike Conaway the Republican leading the investigation said Trump Jr. had answered all of his questions. Trump Jr. arrived and left without being seen by reporters. Lawmakers said they want to question him about a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York at which he had said he hoped to get information about the “fitness character and qualifications” of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the Democrat who was his father’s presidential election opponent. It was at least the second time Trump Jr. has testified to a congressional committee investigating any Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Moscow by the Trump campaign. He arrived shortly before 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and was questioned for most of the next eight hours by members of the intelligence panel. A person familiar with knowledge of Trump Jr’s testimony said Trump had said repeatedly he did not remember things he was asked about including some details about information provided by Russians during the Trump Tower meeting. Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating. He has announced the first charges of Trump associates and Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. The House intelligence panel also released on Wednesday a transcript of testimony last week of Erik Prince a Trump supporter and founder of the Blackwater military contractor. A focus of that testimony was a report that Prince tried to set up a “back channel” for communications between Trump associates and Russia. Prince denied such a plan. Trump Jr.’s appearance coincided with criticism of the Russia probes from some of his father’s fellow Republicans who control both houses of Congress and accuse investigators of bias against Trump . Other lawmakers Republicans as well as Democrats say the goal of the investigations is to guarantee the integrity of U.S. elections not to target Trump and his associates.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles has long been a destination for artistic dreamers from Europe: Zsa Zsa Gabor moved to Hollywood from Hungary in the 1940s to act. Warsaw-born Roman Polanski moved to Southern California in the 1960s to direct. Not to mention one ambitious actor named Arnold Schwarzenegger, who arguably has done more to boost California's image as a place receptive to Europeans than any tourism initiative the state might have dreamed up the past 30 years. But for accented aspiring pop stars from the EU and beyond, L.A. hasn't generally been considered the place to launch an international music career. That honor fell to cities such as London and New York. Until now. The duo, who are identical twins, moved to","completion":"Los Angeles from their native Ireland in 2010 to start their music journey. The twins, known by their stage name, \\"Dublin Vibes,\\" felt the creative allure of L.A.'s diverse music scene and vibrant nightlife. They struggled initially as they faced challenges concerning their unfamiliar accents, lack of funded resources, and fierce competition. Critically, they had outshone their counterparts from the very beginning in passion and determination, evident in their relentless engagement in performing at local venues, creating YouTube covers, and engaging with social media followers. In 2012, Dublin Vibes received their first break when they were spotted by a renowned talent management firm at an open-mic night in downtown L.A. They were signed immediately owing to their unique sound blending contemporary pop music with traditional Irish instrumentation. Nonetheless, major players in the music industry were skeptical. How could an Irish duo, who had never released a radio hit, sell out concerts? Despite the skepticism, Dublin Vibes released their debut album titled \\"Irish Pulse\\" in 2014, which redefined the international music scene. The album, melding their accented lyrical content with a blend of pop, folk, and electronic music, broke boundaries and brought fresh waves to the industry. They found huge success in European and American charts, proving that L.A was indeed a viable launchpad for international music talents. Their success story sparked a new trend, and L.A saw its music scene diversified as more and more foreign artists flocked to seek their American Dream. No longer were London and New York the only cities catered for international pop talents. While Dublin Vibes continued to produce hit singles and sell-out worldwide tours, their impact on LA's music industry extended beyond their personal success. The twins used their influential position to champion diversity in the music industry, frequently collaborating with struggling international artists, and hosting events to raise awareness about cultural representation in music. As for the grand story-telling finale, in 2025, Dublin Vibes was honored with a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' at the Grammy Awards for their ground-breaking contributions to the music scene. Overwhelmed with gratitude, they dedicated their award to their home city of Los Angeles, the city that served as their platform, catalyst, and promised land, allowing them to shift paradigms and redefine international pop music. In essence, this inspiring tale of Dublin Vibes embodies the possibility of making dreams come true in the face of myriad challenges, leading to the emergence of Los Angeles as a global hub for international music talents. By following their passion, belief, and perseverance, Dublin Vibes not only shine as illustrious stars but also lit up the path for aspiring musicians worldwide. Their journey shows us that music knows no boundaries and that the rhythmic language of harmony and melody can indeed speak louder than words."},{"prompt":"Question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Through your discussion of how they feel, they begin to learn words associated with those feelings and can later use those words to talk out their feelings. This will help them transition to talking about feelings instead of acting out their frustrations. You might say something like “I know you are sad that it is bedtime, but we can play with your toys again tomorrow.” It is important to observe how your children play and act out to understand their feelings. By watching and understanding your toddler’s feelings you can more effectively discuss them. You can also teach your toddler to express their feelings in more socially constructive ways. If your toddler is angry, you might say something like “I know that you are upset that the candy is gone, but you cannot hit people. Instead, you can show us you are upset by taking a deep breath and just telling us you are upset.” Toddlers need to understand what is expected of them. They will naturally push the boundaries, but if you set firm limits and give explanations for those limits, most toddlers will begin to respect the rules. This gives them the structure and boundaries they need to feel secure. Emphasize the positive aspects of rules with your toddler. For example, explain that the your child must get enough sleep tonight so that he or she can have more fun tomorrow. Babies do not interact very well with each other, but once children start to reach the toddler phase, they begin to socialize a bit with other kids. Encourage your toddler to make friends, and teach him or her how to do things like introduce him or herself. This is one of the early milestones in socializing your child. Do not be surprised if your toddler plays more “beside” the other children than they play “with” the other children. Parallel play is common in this stage.","completion":"Discussing feelings with your toddler is crucial as it helps them learn words associated with emotions and express themselves better.

It simply informs that the person went to sleep. 2. \\"just to have the power go out three times in the night\\": Here, the sentiment starts shifting towards a negative direction. The writer explains that the power went out thrice during the night, which is generally an unfavorable event as it interrupts sleep and causes inconvenience. 3. \\"Needless to say\\": This phrase typically implies that the following statement is obvious or can be inferred easily. In this context, it serves to emphasize the negative aspect of the experience. 4. \\"I slept very little\\": This statement confirms the negative sentiment of the tweet. The power outages affected the writer's sleep, causing them to rest very little, which is an undesired outcome. 5. \\"cause it was so hot\\": The final part of the tweet explains the primary reason why the writer's sleep was affected – the heat. Without power, there might not have been any air conditioning or fans to cool down the room, further contributing to the negative sentiment.

Cut off collar and arms of one shirt leaving only the mid-section, attach another cut-out midsection and sew to the other midsection to create the skirt section of the dress. Use the arms of the shirt to create straps to hold dress up on shoulders. This option is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because removing the collar and arms will create a cleaner and more continuous mid-section to be used as the skirt portion of the sundress. The unnecessary parts are removed, and the key parts (mid-section and arms) are efficiently utilized for the sundress's construction, maintaining the structural integrity of the dress better in comparison to (A). In option (A), by cutting off the midsection and leaving only the arms, there's potential excess fabric at the shoulder area, which can result in an unusual fit and a less effective design for the dress.

Write some highlights for the following article: Everton are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverley of Manchester United among the options for Roberto Martinez. The midfielder made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to kick-on in the last year with any consistency. Everton manager Martinez was widely credited with improving Cleverley while coaching him at Wigan, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Everton need to sign a few more players. On the move? Everton are interested in Manchester United's much-criticised midfielder Tom Cleverley, with manager Roberto Martinez believing he can reinvigorate the England man. Previous experience: Martinez worked with Cleverley when he was manager of Wigan in 2010-11. Louis van Gaal made Cleverley captain for the friendly against Roma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week whether they have made the cut for his planned 22-man squad. The midfielder did not excel against Roma but like many of the United players is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Everton have already splashed out in excess of £35m this summer with Romelu Lukaku, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Henen's transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Atsu has hit stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverley would cost around £8million. Bradford, Cleverley's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sell on. Decision time: Louis van Gaal will trim his United squad to 22 after their tour of the United States. Statement of intent: Everton have already spent big on striker Romelu Lukaku this summer. VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad. Martinez may yet prefer to bring in Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco or another striker but Cleverley's situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars it would be a huge statement of intent from Everton. The concern at United would be that Martinez could find the key to re-invigorating Cleverley. Van Gaal though will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players' performances. Deals for Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Mats Hummels at Borussia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES. Frank Lampard's arrival at Manchester City has lifted hopes at other clubs that certain fringe players in the Premier League champions' squad will be be made available. Sunderland are among the front runners pushing for a deal with Jack Rodwell while Valencia remain eager to take Bruno Zuculini on loan. Incoming: Frank Lampard's arrival on loan at Manchester City could lead to the departure of other players. Good impression: Bruno Zuculini has looked good on Manchester City's pre-season tour of America. Oriol Romeu has returned from the Spanish League to Chelsea only to be loaned out to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart and Valencia want a defensive-minded midfielder to step in. Zuculini has only just joined from Racing in Argentina but showed on the US tour why City have brought him into their squad. Valencia now hope to give him a season in La Liga where he can continue to improve. However, they face competition for Zuculini from Deportivo La Coruna, who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in Liverpool's defensive starlet Tiago Ilori. SOUTHAMPTON CHASING 'MUSKETEER' SCHELOTTO. Southampton will hold further talks with Inter Milan over winger Ezequiel Schelotto on Tuesday. The 25-year-old should certainly give Ronald Koeman's team a better cutting edge as his nickname is 'El Mosquetero' or 'The Musketeer' - although that moniker owes more to his hair than his rapier-swishing style on the wing. It is understood the nickname he actually prefers is 'El Galgo' or 'the Greyhound'. Negotiations: Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is close to sealing the signing of Ezequiel Schelotto. Whatever name he wishes to use, Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio is keen to push a deal forward. They have agreed terms on Dani Osvaldo and are discussing a loan for midfielder Saphir Taider also. Schelotto's agent Bruno Carpeggiani said: 'The situation with Southampton is active and we are waiting for the deal to go ahead.' Although Argentininian born and raised, Schelotto has been capped by Italy. He spent part of last season on loan at Parma. CANAS SWAPPING SWANSEA FOR ELCHE. Swansea midfielder Jose Canas is due to hold talks with Elche ahead of a return to Spain. Celta Vigo, who are playing a series of friendlies in England at the moment, have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. Swansea manager Garry Monk left Canas out of the club’s pre-season tour to the US, leading his representatives to begin negotiations with Elche sporting director, Victor Orta. Return: Swansea's Jose Canas is holding talks with Elche ahead of a possible return to Spain. Swansea remain on the trail of Almeria's Ramon Azeez and have made enquiries about the Nigerian. Defender Chico Flores remains a target for Michael Laudrup at Lekhwiya. Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000-a-week derailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures won't be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea's Fernando Torres who is on around £150,000. Manager Monk said: 'Unless there's a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it doesn't matter. Even then, we're in control - so all of that doesn't matter, because it's speculation - Wilfried's our player.' Demands: Wolfsburg have shown an interest in Wilfried Bony, but his wages could be a stumbling block. NEWCASTLE SIGN FOREST DUO. Newcastle will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest on Monday and loan the pair back. Manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility. The 23-year-old France midfielder has long been in Newcastle's sights but he is keen to join a Champions League team. If one of those does not come along soon, the greater the Toon's chances become. Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while. LIVERPOOL WRAP UP MORENO DEAL. Liverpool's search for a left-back should be concluded soon as talks progress with Sevilla over the £16m transfer of Alberto Moreno. Sevilla have enquired about Sporting Lisbon's 26-year-old Jefferson Nascimento as a potential short term replacement. LAZIO INTERESTED IN KABOUL. Lazio's interest in Younes Kaboul should help Tottenham offset their pending outlay on Eric Dier and Mateo Musacchio from Villarreal. Tottenham have no plans to sell Jan Vertonghen as part of their defensive restructuring but will continue to listen to offers for Michael Dawson. Kaboul, 28, is valued at around £6m by Tottenham although Lazio want to pay around £3m. They are also looking to offload Michael Ciani to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have no interest in Samuel Eto'o, who is looking more likely to return to Italy at this stage with West Ham also looking at younger options. On his way? Lazio are willing to pay Spurs £3m for Younes Kaboul. WEDNESDAY IMPRESSED BY KELHAR. Sheffield Wednesday have offered Slovenian trialist Dejan Kelhar a short-term contract. The 30-year-old defender, who has won six caps for his country and last played for Red Star Belgrade, has been training at Hillsborough and played in some of their pre-season friendlies. Manager Stuart Gray remains keen to sign a striker but Kelhar has also done enough to earn a deal. Gray said: 'We are offering Dejan a short-term contract and hopefully he will be putting pen to paper for us. Nothing has been finalised, he is mulling it over at the moment.' STOKE STOPPER BACHMANN HEADS TO WREXHAM ON LOAN. Stoke's young goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann is poised to join Conference side Wrexham on loan. The 20 year-old Austrian impressed on trial on Friday when appearing for Wrexham in a friendly against a Bolton select XI. Highlights:","completion":"- Everton is still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverley of Manchester United being one of the options for Roberto Martinez. - Tom Cleverley has 78 first team games under his belt, but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to maintain consistency in the last year. - Everton manager Martinez played a crucial role in Cleverley's improvement while coaching him at Wigan, where he played 25 games in 2010-11. - Louis van Gaal made Cleverley captain for a friendly match against Roma in the USA, and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week whether they will be part of his planned 22-man squad. - Everton has already spent over £35 million this summer, signing players such as Romelu Lukaku, Muhamed Besic, and Brendan Galloway. - A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Atsu has hit a stalemate but is still on, while a transfer for Cleverley would cost around £8 million. - Bradford, Cleverley's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sell-on fees. - Roberto Martinez is also considering bringing in Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco or another striker, but Cleverley's situation will be clearer by next week. - Everton's potential signings could be seen as a statement of intent from the club."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article based on this \\"A Commons debate about Govia Thameslink (GTR) has heard an MP admit she is \\"often ashamed\\" to be Rail Minister.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Rail Minister Admits Feeling \\"Often Ashamed\\" Amidst Commons Debate on Govia Thameslink Intro: A recent debate in the House of Commons centered around Govia Thameslink (GTR) led to the Rail Minister candidly admitting that she's \\"often ashamed\\" to hold her role. This revelation comes amidst widespread criticism of GTR's performance and ongoing issues related to commuter services. Paragraph 1: (Explain the context and details of the Commons debate) The House of Commons recently convened to address the pressing concerns regarding Govia Thameslink, with numerous MPs coming forward to voice their criticisms of the company. GTR has been under fire for its management of commuter services and poor punctuality record, leading many to question its fitness for holding the rail franchise. During the debate, issues related to cancellations, overcrowded trains, and frequent delays were highlighted, which have caused significant disruptions to passengers' lives. Paragraph 2: (Rail Minister's statement) Amidst the heated discussion, the Rail Minister confessed that she is \\"often ashamed\\" to serve in her capacity given the current state of the rail network under GTR's management. The damning admission indicates the severity of the concerns surrounding the company's performance and adds weight to the MPs' impassioned pleas for significant improvements to be made. The Rail Minister's words, however, seem to resonate with the general public, who have long been clamoring for a change in how the rail services are managed. Paragraph 3: (Public reaction to the Rail Minister's statement) The Rail Minister's candid admission sparked a mixed response from the general public, with some praising her honesty while others accusing her of merely paying lip service to the issue. It remains to be seen whether this admission will lead to tangible improvements in GTR's management and overall service quality, however, the minister's statement has garnered increased attention toward the ongoing problems with the rail network. Paragraph 4: (Possible outcomes and consequences) The Commons debate, along with the Rail Minister's admission, could potentially lead to serious repercussions for GTR and its management. Government officials and regulatory bodies may be pressured to take decisive action and review the current railway franchising arrangements, potentially resulting in a major overhaul of the management and operation of services. The situation unfolding around GTR serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of functional public transportation systems for the well-being and prosperity of the nation. Conclusion: As the Commons debate on Govia Thameslink continues to unfold, the Rail Minister's admission of being \\"often ashamed\\" to hold her title has generated significant public interest and sparked discussions about the need for improving the rail network. While it remains to be seen if tangible change will occur, the ongoing scrutiny of GTR serves as an important indication that the status quo is no longer acceptable and demands for a better-public transportation system must be prioritized."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The New York Times The Wolfpak’s loosely affiliated membership comes mostly from the neighboring island of Kauai. It includes professional surfers like the three-time world champion Andy Irons, 30, and his brother, Bruce, 29, a talented free surfer. The most notorious member is the group’s enforcer, Kala Alexander, a professional surfer with muscular tattooed arms and “Wolfpak” inked across his knuckles. In 2007, Alexander starred in “The 808,” a reality television series about the Wolfpak and the North Shore, and appeared in the films “Blue Crush” and “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” But he has also gained fame for YouTube videos that show him pummeling surfers on the sand several years ago. “The code is to respect other people,” Alexander, 39, said. “People come over here and don’t respect other people. You’re going to run into problems if you do that.” That is what happened to Chris Ward, a 30-year-old professional from San Clemente, Calif., and runner-up to Kelly Slater last month at the Pipeline Masters. In November, Australian publications reported that Ward cut off a local surfer while riding a wave at Pipeline. He was banished to the beach, where a Wolfpak member smacked him in the head. Without providing details, Ward confirmed that the incident happened. “It’s been like that for four decades,” said Peter Townend, who in 1976 won the first world championship of surfing on the North Shore. In 1978, he said, he was punched out at a surf break called Off the Wall. In that year he required a police escort to compete in the Pipeline Masters because of threats against him. During the 2007 Pipeline Masters, a fracas in the water spilled onto the beach as Sunny Garcia of Hawaii chased his opening-round opponent, Neco Padaratz of Brazil. Padaratz fled, followed by Garcia and some locals. The police eventually escorted Padaratz from the contest site. Such incidents create debate about localism, a brand of territorialism that has been practiced at surf breaks around the world for decades. Yet the North Shore remains a focal point because its breaks are a proving ground for professional aspirants who arrive each winter along with the massive swells out of the North Pacific. “It’s really the center of the surfing universe,” Tomson said. “It’s like Mount Everest for surfers everywhere. And Pipeline is really the wave one needs to come to terms with as a surfer in order to be considered a great surfer.” As surfing has become increasingly popular, some say fear of violent reprisal ensures order and safety at congested and perilous surf spots like Pipeline. “It’s a dangerous environment, and without a self-governing control pattern it would just be chaos out there,” Rarick said. At Pipeline, large, punishing waves break over a shallow-water reef. With a small takeoff zone comes a small window of time to make critical decisions and dozens of surfers vying for the same waves. Pipeline is considered one of the world’s most dangerous surf spots. No official figures exist on fatalities. But a 2008 book, “The Pipeline: Deep Inside the World’s Most Respected Wave,” asserted that more than 30 people had died there since it was first surfed in 1961. “It’s a very intense crowd,” said Slater, 36, of Cocoa Beach, Fla. “It’s as intense as anywhere in the world because there are serious consequences if you drop in on somebody and they got hurt, or if you wipe out and hurt yourself.” The Wolfpak formed a decade ago when Alexander moved to the North Shore and joined his childhood friend Kai Garcia, a former professional surfer and jujitsu champion known as Kaiborg for his fearsome superhuman reputation. Alexander had recently been released from prison after serving time for assault. “It was crowded when I came here,” Alexander said about Pipeline. “A lot of people in the water, not much respect. Where I grew up on Kauai, you respect everybody in the water, especially your elders. Don’t step out of line. We just brought that mentality over here.” At the time there was a void in the Pipeline lineup as those who regulated the waves during the 1990s, like Derek Ho, Johnny Boy Gomes and Marvin Foster, had grown older and moved on. And there was a template for a group like the Wolfpak. With outsiders and the burgeoning professional contest circuit shunting them from their favorite surf spots, some Hawaiian surfers banded together in 1976 to form the Hui O He’e Nalu, or Club of Wave Sliders. “That was one of the reasons the Hui O He’e Nalu was formed, to regulate the surf breaks,” said Bryan Amona, a founding member. “Not to be walked all over.” In 1975, a brash group of surfers from South Africa and Australia swept the North Shore contests and monopolized news media coverage. The Australians even boasted of their superiority to their Hawaiian counterparts. Some Hawaiians, feeling disrespected at home in a sport their ancestors invented, threatened and thrashed the outsiders when they returned the next winter. “For the Hawaiians, respect is an important concept, particularly when it comes to being in the ocean,” said Isaiah Helekunihi Walker, a professor of history at Brigham Young University, Hawaii, who has written about a Hawaiian renaissance in surfing on the North Shore. Members of Hui O He’e Nalu, known as Da Hui or the Black Shorts, for their uniform surf trunks, paddled into waves during competitions to protest that the water had been closed to them. Eddie Rothman, another Da Hui founder, who with other members has parlayed the club’s name and logo into a surf apparel brand, said violence against the outsiders was not coordinated. “When they came here, there was no cultural resistance,” he said. “They were separate incidents.” For some, “Bustin’ Down the Door” has stirred up the old animus. Walker said: “I think this tradition, even though the Hui started it in the ’70s, Hawaiian surfers are still very much at the forefront of this whole kind of consciousness, of seeing themselves as the chiefs in the water maintaining order.” Da Hui’s membership has mellowed with age, and the group’s agenda has shifted from activism to community events. The Wolfpak has likewise made a bid for increasing respectability with an annual beach cleanup. In December, Alexander visited children in a Honolulu hospital and gave surfing lessons to youngsters with cystic fibrosis. But not everyone is ready to accept the group’s softer side. In November, an Outside magazine article in which Alexander offered a mea culpa for past misdeeds and expressed hope that peace would prevail at the Pipeline prompted readers to denounce the surfers’ tactics. Last month, when a reporter asked Alexander about the online video showing him punching surfers, he became enraged. Several longtime residents said incidents of violence had diminished. “Reported surf-related assaults are very rare, according to the commander” responsible for the North Shore, said Michelle Yu, a spokeswoman for the Honolulu Police Department. Strider Wasilewski, the surf team manager for Quiksilver Americas, who has spent parts of 24 winters on the North Shore, said: “Guys aren’t going crazy beating people in public. It’s just a lot nicer now.” “You can’t get away with the things you used to get away with” because of the threat of lawsuits, he added. But those who come for waves can still catch a beating, too. “It’s not as raw,” Rarick said. “It’s not as radical. But the essence of it is still there.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"This text talks about a group of surfers called the Wolfpak who live in Hawaii.

The North Shore in Hawaii is known for its world-famous waves, especially Pipeline, which is considered one of the most dangerous surf spots. Because of this, surfers from all over the world come to the North Shore, causing lots of competition for waves and sometimes a lack of respect for local surfers. The Wolfpak formed to bring order to the crowded waters and make sure everyone follows the code of respect. There have been incidents in the past where surfers who did not follow the code were physically attacked by the Wolfpak members. Despite their history of using violence, the group has been trying to improve their image by participating in community events, such as beach cleanups and visiting sick children in the hospital. Many people still criticize the Wolfpak's tactics and the use of violence to enforce respect, but some say that the situation in the surfing community has improved over time, and incidences of violence have decreased."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Garry Smith has turned to social media to keep the public informed, connected and, on many occasions, amused. As the in-charge of updating the force's official Facebook page, Sgt. Smith majorly utilises humour and 'dad jokes' to make his posts more approachable and enjoyable. In an era where social media is a pivotal medium for information dissemination, law enforcement agencies are no exception to utilise these platforms. Among these, the NT Police's Facebook page stands out, but not just for its regular updates. It's the unique style of delivery by Sgt. Smith that sets it apart. With every post crafted meticulously, Sgt. Smith has identified an ingenious way of connecting with the community. He incorporates humour and dad jokes into these updates, producing a perfect blend of light-hearted banter with serious information. By blending in the lighter elements, Sgt. Smith manages to demystify the authoritative image often associated with the police force, making it more accessible and approachable for the community.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. **Spoilers contained** I'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. What I didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. What starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. They then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the ending. After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. I didn't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought negatively of the movie.
