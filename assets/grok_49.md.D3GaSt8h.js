Think like you are answering to a five year old. The United States has brought Abu Anas al Libi -- an alleged al Qaeda operative whom U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers captured in Libya this month -- to New York, a U.S. attorney's office said Monday. He was transferred to law enforcement custody and brought to the United States on Saturday, according to a letter from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to a federal judge. Al Libi is expected to appear before a judicial officer on Tuesday, Bharara's office said. His family in Tripoli said they were shocked that he was in the United States. They had received no details of his whereabouts from the U.S. or Libyan governments, family members told CNN. His son, Abdullah, said the family hoped to get him a lawyer that would \\"work with him, for him.\\" It was unclear if al Libi already has a lawyer. \\"We don't want him talking to just anyone,\\" Abdullah said. \\"We don't want just any lawyer asking him questions.\\" A U.S. official said al Libi received care at a medical facility in New York for a pre-existing medical condition and is \\"doing better.\\" The official did not detail the medical issue. His wife told CNN this month that al Libi has a severe case of hepatitis C and that she was worried about his health. U.S. special operations forces captured al Libi in Tripoli more than a week ago. The 49-year-old native of Libya is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The United States had been holding him aboard a Navy ship, U.S. officials said. He was questioned there by members of a high-value detainee interrogation team, the officials said. American officials have described him as \\"one of the world's most wanted terrorists.\\" He was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. Some terrorism experts have questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide for his captors. A former jihadist associate told CNN last week that it was unlikely that he was still playing an active role with the terrorist network. His wife said he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry. Al Libi was captured October 5 on the street in front of his home as he returned in his car from morning prayers. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as al Libi in American courts. Trying such suspects on American soil has been a controversial topic in the past. In 2009, Holder said five detainees with alleged ties to the September 11, 2001, attacks would be transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to New York for trial in civilian court. Later Holder reversed course, announcing that accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others would be tried in a military commission at Guantanamo instead. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week that there was no chance that al Libi would end up at Guantanamo. \\"The administration's position on Guantanamo is clear. Our goal is not to add to the population, it's to reduce it, which we've done. ... Our policy is not to send any new detainees to Guantanamo,\\" she said. Still, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was \\"unfortunate that al Libi is on American soil, ending the interrogation process.\\" \\"It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try (terror suspects) in the U.S. because once you arrive on U.S. soil, that ends the interrogation of these high value detainees,\\" Kind said, said, adding would not have happened if al Libi had been sent to Guantanamo Bay and faced a military commission there. King, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, credited the government with giving advance notice of al Libi's arrival to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelley, which allowed them to have security measures in place.

Answer for Question 2: To group similar but not exact product names, follow these steps: 1. Start by collecting all the product names in a list. 2. Develop an algorithm that can measure the similarity of the names (for example, using similarity metrics like Jaccard, Levenshtein distance, or Cosine similarity). 3. Based on the similarity metric, identify a threshold to determine if two product names should be considered 'similar.' 4. Use a clustering algorithm, like hierarchical clustering or k-means, to group similar product names based on the similarity metric and threshold. Alternatively, you can also use fuzzy matching or supervised/unsupervised machine learning techniques to group similar products. 5. Review and fine-tune the algorithm if needed to ensure accurate grouping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area? ? Almost 250 different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed \\"Black Saturday\\", more than 150,000 acres (610 km2) were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings, Montana, 60 miles (97 km) to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6 km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61 m) high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) a day, and there were even occasions when more than 2 miles (3.2 km) in one hour were recorded.One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the southern section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and like the Shoshone fire, advanced little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19, and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village...

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

A plunger is a tool we use to help clear a blocked drain, like when you can't flush your toilet or water goes down so slowly in your sink. It looks like a rubber cup on a stick. Here's a simple way to use a plunger: 1. Pick the best plunger: Make sure to choose a plunger that has a big rubber cup. For toilets, use a plunger with a flange, which looks like a little extra bit sticking out from the bottom of the cup. 2. Get a good seal: Put the rubber part of the plunger (the cup) right over the hole where the water goes down. You want to make sure that all the sides of the rubber cup touch the surface around the hole, creating a tight seal. 3. Fill with water: The plunger needs water inside the cup to work well. Add some water into the blocked sink or toilet if the water level is too low, so that it covers the rubber cup. 4. Push and pull: Hold the stick part of the plunger with both hands and push down gently. Then, pull up with a quick, strong motion. You might need to do this a few times. 5. Check the results: After pushing and pulling a few times, quickly lift the plunger up. If you see the water going down quickly, hooray! You've cleared the blockage! If not, repeat steps 4 and 5 until the water flows easily. And that's it! Now you know how to use a plunger to fix your blocked drain like a superhero!

Despite his apparent success and dedication to his community, he faces tough competition from his opponent, Vikram Singh. They both want to win the upcoming election to become the head of the municipal council. As the campaigning heats up, Tiwari Bhaisaab learns of an unlikely endorsement from a mysterious and feared outlaw, Raghav \\"Raghu\\" Yadav. Raghu is a Robin Hood-esque figure, a modern bandit who steals from the rich and helps the poor. Despite his criminal actions, Raghu is popular amongst the lower class in the town. Tiwari Bhaisaab, initially reluctant to accept the support of a criminal, has a change of heart when he learns about Raghu's good deeds and intentions. This newly formed alliance strengthens Tiwari Bhaisaab's chances of winning the election, but it also catches the attention of the local police and intelligence agencies, who have long been trying to track down and apprehend Raghu. Unbeknownst to Tiwari Bhaisaab, Vikram Singh has another card up his sleeve - Kishore Srivastava, a corrupt police officer who has personal vendetta against both Tiwari Bhaisaab and Raghu. Kishore collaborates with Vikram, aiming to bring down Tiwari Bhaisaab's campaign and reputation, while also settling his scores with Raghu. As the election inches closer, Tiwari Bhaisaab and Raghu must work together to not only secure a victory in the election but also thwart the sinister plans of Vikram Singh and Kishore Srivastava. Their bond deepens when both men reveal dark secrets from their past, uniting them against their common enemies.

When the sandpaper is rubbed across the glass table, there is less friction between the two surfaces due to the relatively smooth nature of the glass. On the other hand, gravel consists of small pieces of rock and other materials, which inherently makes it a rough and irregular surface. When the sandpaper is rubbed against the gravel, the rough surface of the sandpaper interacts with the rough surface of the gravel. As a result, there is increased contact between the small, abrasive particles in both surfaces, leading to a much higher amount of friction. Therefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph and the nature of the surfaces in question, the friction will be less between the sandpaper and the glass table compared to the sandpaper and the gravel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Blood In Blood Out The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews. On IMDb it holds an 8/10. The TV Guide review stated \`\`similarity to Edward James Olmos' American Me, in which a tormented drug dealer travels the same route through prison society as Miklo. The principal difference between the two films is that Bound By Honor is by far the glossier effort, relentlessly picturesque in the seamlessly anesthetized manner of mainstream Hollywood films.'' Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum for the Chicago Reader wrote that this \`\`ugly three-hour snoozefest is apparently supposed to do for East Los Angeles Chicanos what the Godfather movies did for New York mafiosi...'' Roger Ebert wrote \`\`The East Los Angeles milieu and some of the characters seem familiar, because some of the same ground was covered by American Me... Bound by Honor covers similar material in a less passionate and finally less meaningful way.'' Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4. A critic from Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave Bound By Honor a B-, falling on the high end of the movie spectrum. He states \`\`Bound By Honor comes fully alive when it moves behind bars. There's an exploitative thrill built into the genre...'' This film critic was definitely more interested in the second half of the movie once Miklo was in jail running La Onda. Vincent Canby from the New York Times wrote \`\`The film is big and long, passionate and flat. It's full of heroic and tragic incident, but skimpy about the details of quotidian lives.'' Giving a very detailed review on the plot of the story he later exalts some of the characters in the movie one in particular, Enrique Castillo. Although Vincent Canby does not give an official rating for the film, he concludes \`\`Though it's not the epic it means to be, it is not a failure.''

Although both movies share a similar theme of Chicano gang life and explore the world of East Los Angeles, they are not the same film. American Me, directed by Edward James Olmos, focuses on a tormented drug dealer navigating prison society, while Blood In Blood Out (also known as Bound By Honor), directed by Taylor Hackford, follows the lives of three Chicano cousins and their diverging paths in crime, prison, and redemption.

Our goal is to find out what the value of \\"o\\" is. Here is the original equation: -11*o - 7*o - 145 = 11*o Now, let's start by adding the two terms on the left side that have an \\"o\\" in them. In easier words, let's combine -11*o and -7*o: (-11 - 7) * o - 145 = 11*o (-18) * o - 145 = 11*o Now we have: -18*o - 145 = 11*o Next, we want to get all the \\"o\\" terms together on one side of the equation and the number terms on the other side. To do this, let's add 18*o to both sides of the equation: -18*o + 18*o - 145 = 11*o + 18*o This simplifies to: -145 = 29*o Now we just have to find what \\"o\\" is! To do that, let's divide both sides of the equation by 29: -145 / 29 = 29*o / 29 This gives us the answer: o = -5 So, the value of \\"o\\" that solves this equation is -5!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the context and implications slightly differ in each example. In the sentence \\"The Boy Scouts were going to accept him as a member,\\" the word \\"accept\\" refers to the process of approving or welcoming someone into a group or organization, in this case, the Boy Scouts. Here, \\"accept\\" implies that the boy has met certain requirements or criteria, and the Boy Scouts acknowledge that he is an appropriate candidate for inclusion in their group. The underlying message in this context is that membership is contingent on meeting certain standards or expectations, and acceptance into the group is a form of social validation. In the sentence \\"Accept students for graduate study,\\" the word \\"accept\\" refers to the process of admitting students into an academic program, specifically at the graduate level. While the fundamental meaning is still about allowing someone to join or participate, the context here is educational. This implies that the students have met the necessary academic requirements and demonstrated the potential to succeed in a graduate program. In this context, acceptance relates not only to social validation but also to academic aptitude and the potential for intellectual and professional development. Although the word \\"accept\\" has a similar core meaning in both examples, the context, nuances, and implications surrounding its usage differ.

Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Options: A: An effective way to identity Dyslexia at an early stage. B: A learning disorder involving one's intelligence. C: Dyslexia -- a problem affecting one's reading and writing.

Answer the following question: Answer the question below: A person with a high fever will have narrowing or widening of the blood vessels in the skin? Assuming that: When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. Answer:","completion":"A person with a high fever will typically experience widening of the blood vessels in the skin, also known as vasodilation. When the body's temperature increases due to fever, the hypothalamus, which acts as the body's thermostat, senses this change and initiates a response to help regulate the temperature. The hypothalamus releases chemicals which act as messengers and are carried by the blood to various parts of the body, including the blood vessels in the skin. These messengers signal the blood vessels to increase in diameter, allowing more blood to flow near the surface of the skin. This is a vital process because when the blood vessels widen, they increase the amount of heat that can be lost from the body through the skin, thereby helping to cool the body down. The increased blood flow to the skin's surface may make a person with a fever appear flushed or feel warmer to the touch. Additionally, this process may be accompanied by other mechanisms that the body uses to dissipate excess heat, such as sweating. Sweating is a cooling mechanism wherein the body releases water through the skin, which evaporates and takes away heat energy from the body as it changes from liquid to vapor. This further aids in reducing the body's temperature. It is essential to note that while vasodilation in response to fever can be an effective way for the body to manage increased temperatures, it is not always sufficient to bring the body temperature back to normal levels. In some cases, medical intervention may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of the fever and help the person’s body effectively regulate temperature. In summary, a person with a high fever will generally experience vasodilation or widening of blood vessels in the skin as the body's response to increased temperature. This process, along with other mechanisms such as sweating, allows the body to release excess heat and helps regulate the overall body temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement. The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\". The interiors of the rotunda and the dome are inscribed with a quote from William Penn made upon the foundation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: There may be room there for such a holy experiment.

Susan Keating Glaspell (July 1, 1876 - July 28, 1948) was an American playwright, novelist, journalist and actress. With her husband George Cram Cook she founded the Provincetown Players, the first modern American theatre company. During the Great Depression, she served in the Works Progress Administration as Midwest Bureau Director of the Federal Theater Project. Glaspell is known to have composed nine novels, fifteen plays, over fifty short stories, and one biography. Glaspell was highly regarded in her time, and was well known as a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. Her short stories were regularly printed in the era's top periodicals, and her New York Times obituary states that she was \\"one of the nation's most widely-read novelists.\\" However, Glaspell's idealistic tales of strong and independent female protagonists were less popular in the post-war era that stressed female domesticity, and her novels fell out of print after her death. In 1940 a new generation of influential Broadway-based critics began publishing derogatory reviews of her plays, having a sizable effect on her long-term standing. Exacerbating the issue was Glaspell's reluctance to seek publicity and her tendency to downplay her own accomplishments, perhaps a result of her modest Midwestern upbringing. Accordingly, in the United States her work was seriously neglected for many years. Internationally, she received some attention by scholars who were primarily interested in her more experimental work from the Provincetown years. In the late 1970s feminist critics began to reevaluate Glaspell's career, and interest in her work has grown steadily ever since. Today, Glaspell scholarship is a \\"burgeoning\\" field, with several book-length biographies and analyses of her writing being published by university presses in recent years. After a century of being out of print, a large portion of her work has been republished. With major achievements in drama, novel, and short fiction, Glaspell is often cited as a \\"prime example\\" of an overlooked female writer deserving canonization. Perhaps the originator of modern American theater, Glaspell has been called \\"the First Lady of American Drama\\" and \\"the Mother of American Drama.\\" In 2003 the International Susan Glaspell Society was founded, with the aim of promoting \\"the recognition of Susan Glaspell as a major American dramatist and fiction writer.\\" Her plays are frequently performed by college and university theater departments, but she has become more widely known for her often-anthologized works: the one-act play Trifles, and its short-story adaptation, \\"A Jury of Her Peers\\". Since the late 20th century, these two pieces have become staples of theatre and Women's Studies curricula across the United States and the world.

The Maple Leafs announced on Monday that Andersen will be sidelined for three to four weeks because of an upper-body injury he suffered in a pre-Olympic qualifier. Another addition to the squad. Welcome to goaltender Philipp Grubauer! #TeamEUR #WCH2016 pic.twitter.com/ryjnxzGrFb — Team Europe (@TeamEUR_WCH) September 6, 2016 Grubauer’s addition to Team Europe makes him the ninth Capitals player named to a World Cup roster, as the German joins Nicklas Backstrom (Sweden), John Carlson (United States), Braden Holtby (Canada), Evgeny Kuznetsov (Russia), Matt Niskanen (United States), Dmitry Orlov (Russia), T.J. Oshie (United States) and Alex Ovechkin (Russia) at the tournament. Capitals Coach Barry Trotz will also serve as an assistant coach for Team Canada. The 2016 World Cup of Hockey will be held in Toronto from Sept. 17 through Oct. 1, meaning that players competing in it are expected to miss the start of NHL training camp. With Washington’s top two goaltenders in Holtby and Grubauer both participating, there will be more preseason opportunities for the organization’s other goalies, including prospects Adam Carlson and Vitek Vanecek. Joe Cannata, who Washington signed in free agency, is expected to enter training camp as the top goalie while Holtby and Grubauer are absent. Grubauer, 24, represented Germany in international competition at the 2014 world championship, two world junior championships (2009 and 2011) and the 2008 world U-18 championship. Most recently, Grubauer stopped 26 of 28 shots on Sunday in Germany’s 3-2 victory over Latvia to earn Germany a berth in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Grubauer posted a 3-0-0 record with two shutouts, a 0.67 goals-against average and a .970 save percentage in three games at the final Olympic qualification tournament. With the addition of Grubauer, the Capitals are one of four NHL teams with two goaltenders playing in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Grubauer had an 8-9-1 record in 2015-16 with a 2.32 goals-against average and a .918 save percentage, and he has posted a 15-15-6 record with a 2.38 goals-against average and a .921 save percentage in 42 career NHL games. Team Sweden, featuring Backstrom, will face Team Europe, featuring Grubauer, on Sept. 14 in an exhibition game at the Verizon Center.

Harris was appointed the university's president in 1921. He was the first BYU president to have a doctoral degree. Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true university, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was eventually replaced by Howard S. McDonald, who received his doctorate from the University of California. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah and rebuilt it to house some of the students. The next president, Ernest L. Wilkinson, also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand. During his tenure, the student body increased six times, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school. Finally, Wilkinson reorganized the LDS Church units on campus, with ten stakes and over 100 wards being added during his administration.

Ask at the seafood counter whether or not the scallops being sold are wet or dry. If they're wet, they've been treated with a chemical (sodium tripolyphosphate) that helps the scallops absorb moisture. Dry scallops haven't been treated so they're fresher, easier to sear, and have a sweeter, brinier taste. Avoid wet scallops since the chemical can make it hard to sear the scallops and the chemical leaves a fishy aftertaste. If you're unable to talk with someone at the seafood counter and are purchasing pre-packaged scallops, you will still need to find out if the scallops are wet or dry. Most labels will clearly state if the scallops are wet or dry. But, if the label doesn't say, check the package for milky white liquid in the bottom. If you see this liquid and the scallops look opaque or really white, they're probably wet scallops. If you don't see any liquid and the scallops plump and clearer, they're most likely dry scallops. While some markets will remove the little flap of muscle that connects the scallop to its shell, others won't. Check over your muscles to make sure these little flaps are all removed since they can be tough. To remove the side muscle, simply pinch it and pull it away. You can throw away the side muscles or save them to make a fish stock. If you accidentally miss a side muscle, it's safe to eat. Take a paper towel and blot any excess moisture from the scallops. Season the scallops with a little salt before you're ready to start pan frying them. The salt can also help draw out extra moisture from the scallops. Try to get the scallops as dry as possible since this will help create a golden brown sear.","completion":"When buying scallops, ensure they are dry and not treated with sodium tripolyphosphate for better taste, easier searing, and freshness; check labels and packaging for signs of wet scallops and remove side muscles before cooking for best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Catalan language With the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon (1479), the use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature experienced a decline, the language came under the influence of Spanish, and the urban and literary classes became bilingual. Q: When were Castille and Aragon united?","completion":"The crowns of Castille and Aragon were united on October 19, 1469, through the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castille. This crucial event ultimately led to the formation of the Kingdom of Spain. The union became official when Ferdinand and Isabella were jointly crowned as monarchs of Castille and Aragon in 1479, following the death of John II of Aragon, Ferdinand's father. The union of these two powerful kingdoms had a profound impact on the development of the Catalan language and its literature. Although both crowns maintained their separate institutions, laws, and customs, the rise of Spanish as a common and prestigious language began to overshadow the use of Catalan, particularly among the noble and ruling classes. Throughout the 16th century, Catalan literature faced a decline, and the influence of the Spanish language in administration, education, and public life grew stronger. As the literary and urban classes in the territories of the Crown of Aragon (including Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands) became bilingual, the cultural, social, and political importance of the Catalan language diminished. This decline in the status of Catalan persisted over the centuries, even in the face of various efforts to revive its importance. Although Catalan has experienced periods of resurgence in modern times, particularly in the early 20th century and during the transition to democracy in Spain, the historical effects of the union of Castille and Aragon continue to be felt in the linguistic landscape and cultural identity of the Catalan-speaking regions. Today, Catalan is still spoken by millions of people across various regions in Spain, as well as in parts of France and Italy. Moreover, it has been recognized as an official language in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia, where it maintains a rich and diverse literary and cultural tradition. Efforts to promote and preserve the Catalan language and its cultural heritage continue, both within these regions and among Catalan-speaking communities around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What are the names of the two archipelagos of India? is inside the article: India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The two archipelagos of India mentioned in the provided text are the Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Lakshadweep archipelago consists of coral atolls off India's southwestern coast, while the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a volcanic chain located in the Andaman Sea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question In February 1865 Brahmss mother died, and he began to compose his large choral work A German Requiem Op. 45, of which six movements were completed by 1866. Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo \\"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahmss arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms), (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46–49). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (cantata) (1863–1868), his Two String Quartets, Op. 51 (Brahms) Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his Symphony No. 1 (Brahms) which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855. How many years did it take Brahm to complete A German Requiem Op. 45?","completion":"To find the number of years it took Brahms to complete A German Requiem Op. 45, we need to identify the starting and ending years of its composition. According to the article: 1. Brahms began composing A German Requiem Op. 45 after his mother's death in February 1865. 2. Six movements were completed by 1866. 3. A seventh movement was added for the Leipzig premiere in February 1869. Since Brahms started composing A German Requiem Op. 45 in 1865 and added the last movement in 1869, it took him 4 years to complete the piece (1869 - 1865 = 4)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What country of origin does Yu Ying-shih and Asian studies have in common? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The country of origin that Yu Ying-shih and Asian studies have in common is China. Yu Ying-shih (1930-2021) was a renowned Chinese-born American historian and scholar, recognized for his expertise in Chinese intellectual history and historiography. Born in the Anhui Province of China, Yu Ying-shih's early life was spent in China before he eventually moved to the United States to continue his academic pursuits. His keen understanding of Chinese history, society, culture, and classical literature allowed him to contribute significantly to the field of Asian studies, particularly in the realm of Chinese history. Asian studies, as an interdisciplinary academic field, encompasses the history, culture, politics, religion, and literature of various Asian countries, among which China is a particularly significant contributor. China, being one of the world's oldest civilizations with a rich cultural heritage and historical legacy, has long been a significant focus area within Asian studies. Chinese history and culture have been an essential part of understanding not only Asian societies but also the global impact of such an influential civilization. In summary, the country of origin that connects both Yu Ying-shih and Asian studies is China, owing to Yu Ying-shih's Chinese birth and his extensive scholarly contributions to the understanding of Chinese history and culture, which in turn contributes towards the broader field of Asian studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to buy a hotel, you'll need to put together as much money as you can for a down payment. In addition, you'll need money to close the sale and run the hotel until it begins returning profits to you.","completion":"1. Determine your budget and financial capabilities: Before you start looking at hotel businesses to buy, you should first determine how much money you have available for investment. This includes not just the initial acquisition cost, but also any necessary renovations, updates, and working capital to run the business until it starts generating a profit. Keep in mind that hotel businesses can be quite expensive, especially if you're looking at larger or more upscale properties. You may wish to consider a combination of personal savings, loans, and investment from outside partners to fund your purchase. 2. Research the hotel industry and market: Having a clear understanding of the hotel industry and the market in your targeted area is crucial when looking to buy a hotel business. Research the market trends, demographics, economic conditions, and competition in the desired location. This information will help you decide the best type of hotel to buy, and it will give you a better idea of the long-term viability and potential profitability of the business. 3. Find hotel properties for sale: Use various methods to identify potential hotel businesses for sale. You can search online real estate and business listing websites, contact hotel brokers (who specialize in these types of transactions), or network with other professionals in the industry for leads. It's important to consider multiple options so you can find a hotel that best fits your budget, goals, and location preferences. 4. Perform a thorough due diligence: Once you have identified hotel properties of interest, you need to evaluate them comprehensively and determine if they meet your investment criteria. This includes reviewing the hotel's financial statements, occupancy rates, profit margin, and condition of the property. You should also investigate whether there are any liens, pending lawsuits, or outstanding tax issues associated with the property. Hiring a professional, such as a hotel consultant, a commercial real estate attorney, and an accountant, can help in this process by providing expert insights and legal guidance. 5. Develop a business and marketing plan: Before you make any decisions, you should create a detailed business and marketing plan for the hotel you wish to buy. This plan should outline your strategy for improving operations, increasing revenue, attracting and retaining guests, and achieving long-term success. Consider factors like room pricing, customer service, amenities that will differentiate you from competitors, and your ideal target market. Additionally, explore various marketing channels and strategies to maximize your exposure to potential guests. 6. Negotiate and finalize the deal: Once you have found a hotel that satisfies your criteria and completed due diligence, the next step is to make an offer and negotiate the terms of the sale with the seller. Work with your attorney and accountant to prepare an offer that protects your interests and still remains attractive to the seller. During this negotiation phase, you can request concessions, such as a price reduction or favorable payment terms. 7. Arrange financing: With the deal under contract, you must now secure any necessary financing to complete the acquisition. Traditional banks, specialized hotel lenders, and private investors are all potential sources of funding. Make sure you have a robust financial plan and a strong credit score to make your financing application more appealing to lenders. 8. Close the deal and assume ownership: After settling the financing, you will need to close the transaction. Work with your attorney and other professionals to ensure all the required documentation is properly completed. Once everything is in order, you will take ownership of the hotel, obtain the necessary licenses and insurance, and begin running the business. 9. Implement your business and marketing plan: With the hotel business now under your control, it's time to implement your strategies as outlined in your business and marketing plan. This could include renovating the facilities, improving the quality of service, and launching marketing campaigns. It's essential to monitor the results of your efforts and be prepared to adapt your strategies as needed. 10. Continuously improve and grow your hotel business: Finally, continuously look for ways to improve your hotel business and increase profitability. Keep up with industry trends, invest in staff training and development, and frequently review your business and marketing plans to ensure you remain competitive in your market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chloe's rusting blue Vespa was tucked away beside the house, in the narrow space separating it from the neighbors. To anyone walking by outside, everything looked quiet and peaceful. Inside, Chloe was pissed. Everything had been going great and then those stupid fuckers had decided to show up a week early, forcing her to scramble to pack a week's work into a single day. She wore a black bandana wrapped around her head, covering her buzz cut pink hair. Numerous smudges of dirt on her cheeks and the tip of her nose testified to the heavy-duty cleaning she'd been doing for the past five hours. She wore loose fitting shorts and a tight-fitting tank top that had once been white. In her bare feet she pushed a mop across the hardwood floors, grumbling to herself. She heard the door open and looked up to see Paul standing in the doorway. Even though it wasn't his fault, she glared at him as he came in. As much as Chloe liked a clean house, she hated housework, and this wasn't even her house. This particular space was sparsely decorated with just a few worn pieces of furniture and some bad condo art on the walls. After six months of being sealed up tight with the air conditioner off, it smelled of dust and mildew and needed a good airing out. \\"What are you doing?\\" asked Paul, closing the door behind him. \\"Mopping,\\" she said, her voice flat. \\"Right.

Menachem Begin ( listen ; Hebrew: m@nakhem be'giyn Menahem Begin, Polish: Mieczyslaw Biegun; Russian: Menakhem Vol'fovich Begin Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 - 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. In 1978 Begin, aided by Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, came to Washington and Camp David to negotiate the Camp David Accords, leading to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty with Egyptian President, Anwar Sadat. Before going to Washington to meet President Carter, Begin visited Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson for his advice. Under the terms of the treaty, brokered by US President, Jimmy Carter, Israel was to hand over the Sinai Peninsula in its entirety to Egypt. The peace treaty with Egypt was a watershed moment in Middle Eastern history, as it was the first time an Arab state recognized Israel's legitimacy whereas Israel effectively accepted the land for peace principle as blueprint for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Given Egypt's prominent position within the Arab World, especially as Israel's biggest and most powerful enemy, the treaty had far reaching strategic and geopolitical implications. Almost overnight, Begin's public image of an irresponsible nationalist radical was transformed into that of a statesman of historic proportions. This image was reinforced by international recognition which culminated with him being awarded, together with Sadat, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. Yet while establishing Begin as a leader with broad public appeal, the peace treaty with Egypt was met with fierce criticism within his own Likud party. His devout followers found it difficult to reconcile Begin's history as a keen promoter of the Greater Israel agenda with his willingness to relinquish occupied territory. Agreeing to the removal of Israeli settlements from the Sinai was perceived by many as a clear departure from Likud's Revisionist ideology. Several prominent Likud members, most notably Yitzhak Shamir, objected to the treaty and abstained when it was ratified with an overwhelming majority in the Knesset, achieved only thanks to support from the opposition. A small group of hardliners within Likud, associated with Gush Emunim Jewish settlement movement, eventually decided to split and form the Tehiya party in 1979. They led the Movement for Stopping the Withdrawal from Sinai, violently clashing with IDF soldiers during the forceful eviction of Yamit settlement in April 1982. Despite the traumatic scenes from Yamit, political support for the treaty did not diminish and the Sinai was handed over to Egypt in 1982. Begin was less resolute in implementing the section of the Camp David Accord calling for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He appointed Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon to implement a large scale expansion of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, a policy intended to make future territorial concessions in these areas effectively impossible. Begin refocused Israeli settlement strategy from populating peripheral areas in accordance with the Allon Plan, to building Jewish settlements in areas of Biblical and historic significance. When the settlement of Elon Moreh was established on the outskirts of Nablus in 1979, following years of campaigning by Gush Emunim, Begin declared that there are \\"many more Elon Morehs to come.\\" During his term dozens of new settlements were built, and Jewish population in the West Bank and Gaza more than quadrupled.

Since taking office, he has sought to reduce the 72 billion (Â£49 billion) debt burden that Puerto Rico owes its creditors. In June 2015, the governor publicly declared that the island was unable to pay all of its obligations. Unlike municipalities on the US mainland, Puerto Rico cannot legally file for bankruptcy, as American cities like Detroit have done when faced with similar crises. In September 2015, the government unveiled what it called an economic recovery programme. Mr Padilla Garcia has worked with the island's development bank to restructure its debt burden.

Generate a question that has the following answer: He asks for money to keep his identity secret. for the following movie plot: Nick Parsons (Bruce Greenwood) and his wife Elizabeth (Ashley Judd), known as Libby, are wealthy residents of Whidbey Island, Washington. He buys her a yacht and they set off sailing for the weekend. After a session of love making, Libby falls asleep. She wakes to find her husband missing and blood all over her hands, clothes, legs, and the boat's floors. A Coast Guard vessel appears and Libby is spotted holding a bloody knife she found lying on the deck. She is arrested, humiliated in the media, tried, and convicted of her husband's murder. Libby asks her best friend, Angela Green (Annabeth Gish), to look after her 4-year-old son, Matty (Benjamin Weir), for the duration of her prison sentence. On a phone call with Matty from prison, Libby hears a door open in the background, then Matty exclaims, \\"Daddy!\\" right before the line goes dead. Libby realizes that Nick possibly faked his death and framed her, leaving their son as the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy, as people convicted for murder are not allowed to collect the life insurance on their victims. After attempting (unsuccessfully) to get investigative help, she is told by a fellow inmate named Margaret (Roma Maffia) that if she were to get paroled for good behavior, she could kill Nick with impunity due to the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Libby is paroled after six years and begins searching for Nick and Matty, while living in a halfway house under the supervision of parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones). Libby violates her curfew and is caught breaking into Matty's school on Whidbey Island to try to get Angela's records, but manages to escape from Lehman and continue her search. After discovering Angela has recently died in Colorado, Libby recognizes a Kandinsky painting in a newspaper photo. Tracing it through a dealer's database (which nearly again allows her capture by Lehman) leads her to New Orleans, where she finds Nick living a luxurious lifestyle under an assumed name, Jonathan...

We'll pretend that the letter 'b' is a toy. Let's figure out how to solve the math problem! The problem is: b - 6*b + 77 = 2*b First, let's focus on the toys (b's) on the left side. We have 1 b and then we take away 6 b's. So, 1 b - 6 b = -5 b. Now our problem looks like this: -5*b + 77 = 2*b Now, we want to bring all the toys (b's) together. To do that, we will add 5 b's to both sides of the equation: -5*b + 5*b + 77 = 2*b + 5*b This simplifies to: 77 = 7*b Now, we want to know how many toys (b's) there are in total. To find that, we can share these 77 equally among the 7 b's. So, we will divide 77 by 7: 77 ÷ 7 = 11 That means there are 11 toys (b's) in total! So, the solution is b equal to 11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Answer the question based on the following text. Question: If Mary is running and race and begins to breathe hard, what happens to the air pressure in her lungs as she expands her chest increases or decreases? Text: Exhaling, or breathing out, decreases the size of the chest, which increases air pressure inside the lungs. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided text, we can infer that when Mary is running a race and begins to breathe hard, the air pressure in her lungs undergoes changes. Specifically, as she expands her chest while inhaling, the reverse process of the described scenario for exhaling would occur. The text states that exhaling decreases the size of the chest and subsequently increases the air pressure inside the lungs. This suggests that when Mary inhales and expands her chest, it allows for more air to enter her lungs, which causes the chest cavity to increase in size. Consequently, the air pressure inside her lungs decreases. In summary, as Mary takes deeper breaths and expands her chest while running a race and breathing hard, the air pressure in her lungs decreases in response to the chest cavity's expansion and increased air intake. This contrasting relationship between chest size and air pressure in the lungs helps maintain efficient respiratory function, enabling her to continue running and meet the increased oxygen demands of her body during the race."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Penelope decides to disguise herself as an old woman and rob her husband's bank. While the police, including Lieutenant Horatio Bixbee (Peter Falk), rush to get to the bank, Penelope escapes in a red wig and yellow suit. She donates some of the stolen money to a Salvation Army worker and donates the suit to a second-hand thrift shop.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who is jailed?, using the article: Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is able to finally convince Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man. Shortly before the wedding, Kelly arrives at Grant's mansion, only to find him on the verge of molesting a small girl.

(), is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor. In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. In August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series One Night Stand. Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped in front of a studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. He appeared in three films in 2008: Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and Role Models. C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, Chewed Up, which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy or Variety Special. C.K. and his wife Alix Bailey divorced in 2008, with C.K. and Bailey sharing joint custody of their children. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, \\"well, there goes my act.\\" He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realize \\"I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling.\\" One element in his preparation for stand-up was training at the same boxing gym as Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to \\"learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating.\\" On April 18, 2009, C.K. recorded a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials--which had all been produced for television networks--Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film The Invention of Lying, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009.

With autumn in full swing, the sight of trees shedding their golden leaves and the faint scent of chimney smoke in the air brought about a sense of serenity that was hard to come by in their bustling city lives. Rachel cherished these walks with her four-legged companion, Max, as it gave her a chance to unwind, clear her head, and reflect on her thoughts and feelings. Max, an energetic Golden Retriever, eagerly bounded through the crunchy leaves, his wagging tail showing just how much he enjoyed these walks as well. As they walked along the winding path through the park, Rachel couldn't help but be grateful for the strong bond that had formed between her and Max over the years. Whenever she felt down or anxious, merely spending a few moments with Max seemed to have a therapeutic effect on her emotions, and she often wondered if he too could sense her gratitude. Meanwhile, back at their home, Lindsey was actively engaged in a playful game of fetch with their feisty Corgi named Daisy. Lindsey, who had always been a fan of calmer indoor activities, found playing with Daisy to be both exciting and soothing. Although they had initially gotten Daisy to keep Max company, she had become an integral part of Lindsey's routine, providing the perfect dose of lightheartedness and comfort that helped her break away from her daily stresses. As the crimson sun dipped below the horizon, the sky painted with a myriad of colors slowly began transforming into a soft blanket of twinkling stars. Rachel and Max, having completed their walk, returned home to the waiting warmth of their small abode. The moment the door opened, Daisy, sensing her canine companion's return, eagerly scampered over and enthusiastically greeted Max with a series of playful barks and nuzzles. Lindsey looked up from her book, her face breaking into a contented smile as she watched the two dogs banter lovingly. The simple bond between these four souls was truly a beautiful sight to behold. They all settled down in the living room, where a crackling fire roared within the hearth. The scent of burning wood mingled with the comforting aromas of freshly brewed herbal tea that Lindsey had prepared to be shared between the two of them. As they sat down on the comfortable sofa, Rachel began recounting her walk with Max while Lindsey shared stories about their playtime with Daisy. The hours passed by peacefully, with laughter and lighthearted conversation filling the air. As the night grew increasingly darker, the two shared stories about life, love, and their dreams for the future. At one point, Max and Daisy tucked by their side, the two realized just how lucky they were to have found a companion in each other, and how their world had become even brighter with the addition of their beloved pets. With full hearts and a sense of gratitude, the night passed as they continued talking, occasionally sharing knowing glances, and pausing to stroke the soft fur of their sleeping dogs. In these moments, time seemed almost to stand still, making room for the simple yet profound joy that comes from sharing life with those you love the most.

Mortimer was born in Hampstead, London, the only child of Kathleen May (nee Smith) and Clifford Mortimer, a barrister who became blind in 1936 when he hit his head on the door frame of a London taxi but still pursued his career. Clifford's loss of sight was not acknowledged openly by the family. John Mortimer was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford and Harrow School, where he joined the Communist Party, forming a one-member cell. Originally Mortimer intended to be an actor (his lead role in the Dragon's 1937 production of Richard II gained glowing reviews in The Draconian) and then a writer, but his father persuaded him against it, advising: \\"My dear boy, have some consideration for your unfortunate wife... With weak eyes and doubtful lungs, Mortimer was classified as medically unfit for military service in World War II. He worked for the Crown Film Unit under Laurie Lee, writing scripts for propaganda documentaries. I lived in London and went on journeys in blacked-out trains to factories and coal-mines and military and air force installations. For the first and, in fact, the only time in my life I was, thanks to Laurie Lee, earning my living entirely as a writer. If I have knocked the documentary ideal, I would not wish to sound ungrateful to the Crown Film Unit. I was given great and welcome opportunities to write dialogue, construct scenes and try and turn ideas into some kind of visual drama. He based his first novel, Charade, on his experiences with the Crown Film Unit. Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955 with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio's Third Programme, later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline? at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958 before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. It was revived by Christopher Morahan in 2007 as part of a touring double bill, Legal Fictions. His play A Voyage Round My Father, given its first radio broadcast in 1963, is autobiographical, recounting his experiences as a young barrister and his relationship with his blind father. It was memorably televised by BBC Television in 1969 with Mark Dignam in the title role. In a slightly longer version the play later became a stage success (first at Greenwich Theatre in 1979 with Dignam, then a year later at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, now starring Alec Guinness). In 1981 it was remade by Thames Television with Laurence Olivier as the father and Alan Bates as young Mortimer. In 1965, he and his wife wrote the screenplay for the Otto Preminger film Bunny Lake is Missing, which also starred Olivier.

Given the question: Information: - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ariidae or ariid catfish are a family of catfish that mainly live in marine waters with many freshwater and brackish water species . They are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones . The family includes about 143 species . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms). - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. What is the relationship between 'ariidae' and 'siluriformes'? The answer is:","completion":"Ariidae is a family of catfish that is part of the order Siluriformes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information: - Cartmel Priory church serves as the parish church of Cartmel , Cumbria ( formerly in Lancashire ) . The priory was founded in 1190 by William Marshal , created 1st Earl of Pembroke , intended for the Augustinian Canons and dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin and Saint Michael . To support the new house William granted it the whole fief of the district of Cartmel . It was first colonised by a prior and twelve monks from Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire . The only other surviving monastic building is the gatehouse which faces the village square . The church is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere , the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness , and the diocese of Carlisle . Its benefice is united with those of St Mary , Allithwiate , St Peter , Field Broughton , St John the Baptist , Flookburgh , St Paul , Grange - over - Sands , Grange Fell Church , Grange - Over - Sands , and St Paul , Lindale , to form the benefice of Cartmel Peninsula . The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. - The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi. These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. Theses orders adheres to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary, among many others. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is abbess. - The Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel by synecdoche) is a Roman Catholic religious order founded, probably in the 12th century, on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States, hence the name Carmelites. However, historical records about its origin remain uncertain. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived, and this is likely to be a later extrapolation by hagiographers. - The Peerage of England comprises all peerages created in the Kingdom of England before the Act of Union in 1707. In that year, the Peerages of England and Scotland were replaced by one Peerage of Great Britain. - The River Eea is a small river in the Lake District, Cumbria, England running through the Furness region, which was once part of Lancashire. The River Eea is a relatively short system that arises from numerous small becks and streams throughout the Cartmel Valley. Its course is approximately 10 km long and the mouth is on Sand Gate marshes near Flookburgh, between Barrow and Kendal. It principally flows in a south-westerly direction. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - A monk (from , \\"monachos\\", \\"single, solitary\\" and Latin \\"monachus\\") is a person who practices religious asceticism, living either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy. - A priory is a monastery of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a prior or prioress. Priories may be houses of mendicant friars or religious sisters (as the Dominicans, Augustinians, Franciscans, and Carmelites, for instance), or monasteries of monks or nuns (as the Benedictines). Houses of canons regular and canonesses regular also use this term, the alternative being \\"canonry\\". - The Local Government Act 1972 (c 70) is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom that reformed local government in England and Wales on 1 April 1974. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London. - Furness is an area of Cumbria in northwestern England. Together with Cartmel it forms North Lonsdale, which was historically an exclave of Lancashire. The region may be split into two areas: Low Furness and High Furness. The former consists of the headland bounded on west by the Duddon estuary and on the east by Morecambe Bay, while the latter extends inland into the Lake District and contains the Furness Fells. Off the southern tip of Low Furness is Walney Island, eighteen kilometers in length, as well as several smaller islands. - Cumbria County Council is the county council of Cumbria, a county in the North West of England. Established in 1974, following its first elections held a year before that, it is an elected local government body responsible for the most significant local services in the county, including county schools, county roads, and social services. - Cartmel is a village in Cumbria, England, north-west of Grange-over-Sands and close to the River Eea. The village was once known as Kirkby in Cartmel, as it was the location of the church for the large parish of Cartmel. It is the location of the 12th century Cartmel Priory. Historically in Lancashire, boundary changes brought it into the newly created county of Cumbria in 1974. - A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - A nun is a member of a religious community of women, typically one living under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. She may have decided to dedicate her life to serving all other living beings, or she might be an ascetic who voluntarily chose to leave mainstream society and live her life in prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent. The term \\"nun\\" is applicable to Catholics (eastern and western traditions), Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus and some other religious traditions. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Prior, derived from the Latin for \\"earlier, first\\", (or prioress for nuns) is an ecclesiastical title for a superior, usually lower in rank than an abbot or abbess. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior. - Cumbria (; locally ) is a non-metropolitan county in North West England. The county and Cumbria County Council, its local government, came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. Cumbria's county town is Carlisle, in the north of the county, and the only other major urban area is Barrow-in-Furness on the southwestern tip of the county. - In Christianity, an abbess (Latin \\"abbatissa\\", feminine form of \\"abbas,\\" abbot) is the female superior of a community of nuns, which is often an abbey. - Grange-over-Sands is a town and civil parish on Morecambe Bay with a wide tidal range, hence the \\"sands\\" name roughly midway between Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in Cumbria, England. Grange-over-Sands was created as an urban district in 1894 and lies historically within Lancashire. In 1974 Cumbria was created under Local Government re-organisation which absorbed the area referred to as \\"Lancashire North of the Sands\\" or North Lonsdale. Grange is now in South Lakeland District. The town remains part of the County Palatine of Lancashire and is part of the Duchy of Lancaster. It had a population of 4,042 in 2001, increasing to 4,114 at the 2011 Census. - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era. - Barrow-in-Furness (; commonly known as Barrow) is a town and borough in Cumbria, North West England. Historically part of Lancashire, it was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867 and merged with adjacent districts in 1974 to form the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness. At the tip of the Furness peninsula, close to the Lake District, it is bordered by Morecambe Bay, the Duddon Estuary and the Irish Sea. In 2011, Barrow's population was 57,000, the second largest urban area in Cumbria after Carlisle. Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as Barrovian. - Lancashire (; archaically the County Palatine of Lancaster; abbreviated Lancs.) is a non-metropolitan ceremonial county in north west England. The county town is Lancaster although the county's administrative centre is Preston. The county has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of . People from Lancashire are known as Lancastrians. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - West Wales is the western region of Wales. Some definitions of West Wales include only Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, which historically comprised the Welsh principality of \\"Deheubarth\\" and was called \\"South West Wales\\" in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). Other definitions include Swansea and Neath Port Talbot but exclude Ceredigion. The \\"West Wales and the Valleys\\" NUTS area includes more westerly parts of North Wales. The preserved county of Dyfed covers what is generally considered to be West Wales, which, between 1974 and 1996, was also a county, with a county council and six district councils. - A mendicant (from , \\"begging\\") is one who practices mendicancy (begging) and relies chiefly or exclusively on charitable donations to survive. In principle, mendicant religious orders do not own property, either individually or collectively, and members have taken a vow of poverty, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on practicing or preaching and serving the poor. It is a form of asceticism. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - Pembrokeshire (, or ) is a county in the south west of Wales. It borders Carmarthenshire to the east and Ceredigion to the north east. Pembrokeshire County Council's headquarters are in the county town of Haverfordwest. - Pembroke Castle is a medieval castle in Pembroke, West Wales. Standing beside the Pembroke River, it underwent major restoration work in the early 20th century. The castle was the original seat of the Earldom of Pembroke. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Pembroke is a historic settlement and former county town of Pembrokeshire in West Wales. The town features a number of historic buildings and complexes and is one of the major population centres in the county. It was the birthplace of Henry Tudor, later Henry VII of England. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The Earldom of Pembroke is a title in the Peerage of England that was first created in the 12th century by King Stephen of England. The title, which is associated with Pembroke, Pembrokeshire in West Wales, has been recreated ten times from its original inception. With each creation beginning with a new first Earl, the original seat of Pembroke Castle is no longer attached to the title.

There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process described is Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the breakdown of glucose. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). This process produces a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the cell's primary energy currency, and NADH, a high-energy electron carrier molecule. Since glycolysis does not require oxygen, it can take place in both aerobic (oxygen-rich) and anaerobic (oxygen-poor) environments. After glycolysis, the fate of the pyruvate molecules depends on the availability of oxygen in the cell. If there is sufficient oxygen, the cell proceeds with the aerobic respiration process, which includes the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, to produce a significantly larger amount of energy. If oxygen is scarce, as described in your statement, anaerobic respiration or fermentation occurs, which generates far less ATP than aerobic respiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Map that named America is a puzzle for researchers WASHINGTON | Mon Dec 3, 2007 1:47pm EST WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The only surviving copy of the 500-year-old map that first used the name America goes on permanent display this month at the Library of Congress, but even as it prepares for its debut, the 1507 Waldseemuller map remains a puzzle for researchers. Why did the mapmaker name the territory America and then change his mind later? How was he able to draw South America so accurately? Why did he put a huge ocean west of America years before European explorers discovered the Pacific? \\"That's the kind of conundrum, the question, that is still out there,\\" said John Hebert, chief of the geography and map division of the Library of Congress. The 12 sheets that make up the map, purchased from German Prince Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg for 10 million in 2003, were mounted on Monday in a huge 6-foot by 9.5-foot (1.85 meter by 2.95 meter) display case machined from a single block of aluminum. The case will be flooded with inert argon gas to prevent deterioration when it goes on public display December 13. Researchers are hopeful that putting the rarely shown map on permanent display for the first time since it was discovered in the Waldburg-Wolfegg castle archives in 1901 may stimulate interest in finding out more about the documents used to produce it. The map was created by the German monk Martin Waldseemuller. Thirteen years after Christopher Columbus first landed in the Western Hemisphere, the Duke of Lorraine brought Waldseemuller and a group of scholars together at a monastery in Saint-Die in France to create a new map of the world. The result, published two years later, is stunningly accurate and surprisingly modern. \\"The actual shape of South America is correct,\\" said Hebert. \\"The width of South America at certain key points is correct within 70 miles of accuracy.\\" Given what Europeans are believed to have known about the world at the time, it should not have been possible for the mapmakers to produce it, he said. The map gives a reasonably correct depiction of the west coast of South America. But according to history, Vasco Nunez de Balboa did not reach the Pacific by land until 1513, and Ferdinand Magellan did not round the southern tip of the continent until 1520. \\"So this is a rather compelling map to say, 'How did they come to that conclusion,'\\" Hebert said. The mapmakers say they based it on the 1,300-year-old works of the Egyptian geographer Ptolemy as well as letters Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci wrote describing his voyages to the new world. But Hebert said there must have been something more. \\"From the writings of Vespucci you couldn't have prepared the map,\\" Hebert said. \\"There had to be something cartographic with it.\\" Waldseemuller made it clear he was naming the new land after Vespucci, describing how he came up with the name America based on the navigator's first name. But he soon had misgivings about what he had done. An atlas Waldseemuller produced six years later shows only part of the east coast of the Americas, and refers to it as Terra Incognita -- unknown land. \\"America has gone out of his lexicon,\\" Hebert said. \\"(No) place in the atlas -- in the text or in the maps -- does the name America appear.\\" His 1516 mariner's map, on the same scale as the 1507 map, steps back even further, showing only parts of the new continents and reconnecting the north to Asia. South America is labeled Terra Nova -- New World -- and North America is labeled Terra de Cuba -- Land of Cuba. \\"Essentially he's reconnecting North America to the Asian mainland, suggesting a continual world of land mass rather than separated by those bodies of water that separate us from Europe and Asia,\\" Hebert said. Why the rollback? No one knows. In writings accompanying the 1516 map, Waldseemuller comes across as if he \\"has seen the better of his error and is now correcting it,\\" Hebert said. He speculated that power politics played a role. Spain and Portugal divided the globe between them in 1494, two years after Columbus, with territory to the east going to Portugal and land to the west to Spain. That demarcation line is oddly absent from the 1507 Waldseemuller map, and flags marking territorial claims in South America suggest Portugal controls the region's southernmost land, even though it is in Spain's area of influence. On the later map, the southernmost flag is Spanish, Hebert said. \\"It is possible one could say the 1507 map is influenced strongly by Portuguese sources and conceivably the 1516 map may be influenced more by Spanish sources,\\" he said. Although the map conceals many mysteries, one thing is clear: it represents a revolutionary shift in the way Europe viewed the world. \\"This is ... essentially the beginning or first map of the modern age, and it's one that everything builds on from that point forward,\\" Hebert said. \\"It becomes a keystone map.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The 1507 Waldseemüller map, the only surviving copy of the 500-year-old map that first used the name America, is going on permanent display at the Library of Congress. 2.

Question: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" 69. After watching the gestures of speakers of the three different languages, Dr. Kita concluded that _ .

Choose your answer from: [i] yes; [ii] no;","completion":"[i] yes; The statement \\"The new constitutions read, 'Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity', the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out.\\" is the correct answer. This is because, in the revised Freemasonry constitution, the mention of \\"the existence of God\\" and \\"the immortality of the soul\\" were indeed removed. The new constitutions emphasized \\"absolute liberty of conscience\\" and \\"human solidarity\\" as its main principles.

Check account settings: Review your Gmail settings, including filters, forwarding, and the \\"Send mail as\\" option, to ensure that the hacker has not made any unauthorized changes. 5. Revoke unauthorized access: Go to the \\"Security\\" section in your Google account settings and check for any unfamiliar devices, apps, or services that have access to your account. Revoke access to anything suspicious. 6. Notify contacts: If the hacker sent emails on your behalf or accessed your contacts, notify your contacts about the situation and advise them to ignore any suspicious emails from your account. 7. Check associated accounts: Review any accounts linked to your Gmail, such as social media or online banking, and ensure they have not been compromised. 8. Update security questions and recovery information: Ensure that your security questions and recovery email or phone number are up-to-date and not manipulated by the hacker. 9.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Summarize this article: Before putting your shoes in a washing machine, remove any harsh stains via spot cleaning. Dissolve a small amount of mild laundry detergent in a bowl of hot water. Dip a rag or sponge in the water. Wipe off any dirt, mud, or other noticeable stains. Hot water should only be used on Sanuks in small amounts. Do not submerge your Sanuks in hot water as this can cause damage. Before placing your Sanuks in a washing machine, wrap them up in some old towels. This will prevent them from banging around inside of the machine too much, preventing damage. It will also lead to a more quiet wash. Use cold water and a color safe detergent to wash your Sanuks. Use a gentle wash if one is offered on your machine. A cup of white vinegar or a few tablespoons of baking soda can help remove bacteria from your shoes. Make sure you're using the cold water setting. Hot water can cause serious damage to Sanuks, causing them to shrink or lose their shape. Never put Sanuks in a machine dryer. Set them somewhere to dry where they will not be disturbed. Within 24 hours, your Sanuks should be dry and ready to wear again. Leather Sanuks should not be washed in a machine. Purchase a leather cleaner online or at a department store to clean leather Sanuks. Spot treat the Sanuks for stains by dabbing or rubbing the leather cleaner onto soiled or dirty areas. Leather cleaners have different precise instructions depending on the type you get. Make sure to read the label carefully to make sure you use your leather cleaner correctly.

Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts above, when an animal perspires, its bodily water decreases. Perspiration, also known as sweating, is a process through which animals regulate their body temperature. When the body temperature rises, the sweat glands produce sweat, which then evaporates from the skin's surface and helps cool the body down. Fact 1 states that when an animal sweats, its bodily water decreases. This is because the water in sweat comes from the body's internal fluids, primarily blood plasma and extracellular fluid. As the animal perspires, these fluids are drawn out to the skin's surface, leading to a reduction in the animal's bodily water content.

Q:Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What do the KGB agents use the plutonium shipment for ? Movie plot title: The Soldier Movie plot: Renegade KGB agents hijack a plutonium shipment inside the United States and use it to plant a nuclear device in the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oilfield. They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson). Meanwhile, the president authorizes military action against Israel. Given the unpleasant options of the KGB destroying a large part of the world's oil supply or the United States having to invoke a military response to force Israel to remove its settlements from the West Bank, the title character decides to take a third option. His team infiltrates and captures a US nuclear missile silo in Smith Center, Kansas, and obtains independent launch capability. As the American military launches their air strikes toward Israel, The Soldier and Susan break into East Berlin by launching their car over the Berlin Wall, confronting the KGB agents and informing them that if their nuke in Saudi Arabia is detonated, his team in Smith Center will nuke Moscow.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean. Question: We can know from the passage that many scientists think that the noise limit of one hundred twenty decibels would _ .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Process: - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body - Question: suppose the lungs expand more happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The lung expansion is primarily related to the volume of air being pulled into the body and does not directly influence the amount of oxygen getting transferred to the red blood cells, which subsequently distribute oxygen throughout the body. The amount of oxygen that is absorbed in the lungs is dependent on various factors including the concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air, the diffusion capacity of the lungs, the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood, and the cardiac output. If the lungs were to expand more, this would likely initially increase the volume of air being inhaled. However, this doesn't necessarily mean more oxygen would reach the body. The efficacy of oxygen transfer in the lungs depends on a delicate balance of many physiological variables. If lung expansion were to increase substantially, it might actually alter this balance and could potentially even lead to less efficient oxygen transfer. For example, excessively large breaths might distend the lung tissues and disrupt the normal architecture of the alveoli (the microscopic air sacs responsible for oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange), thus impairing gas exchange. Moreover, larger lung volumes may also cause changes in airway resistance and alter the mechanics of breathing, which could lead to faster, more superficial breathing. This can result in an increase in dead space ventilation (i.e. areas of the lung where air is ventilated but doesn't participate in gas exchange), reducing the fraction of each breath that is effectively used for oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange. Therefore, if the lungs expand more, it could possibly result in less oxygen reaching the body, considering potential negative impacts on the efficiency of lung function, oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, and breathing mechanics. So, there might be a negative or \\"less\\" impact on oxygen distribution throughout the body if lungs were to expand more than they functionally should. However, this would highly depend on the specifics of the individual case and additional body's compensatory mechanisms. Please note also that these predictions would best be confirmed empirically, with tests that can directly measure lung function and oxygenation levels. It is advisable to consult a healthcare provider to understand the specifics of lung physiology and pathophysiology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. What process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of nitrogen clouds?","completion":"The given text does not provide information specifically about nitrogen clouds undergoing heat and pressure due to gravitational collapse.

Keypoint: Celibacy is outdated Step 2: Analyze the argument in the context of the topic. The argument is stating that celibacy may be unnatural for most people, and it uses the example of scandals involving sexual predators in the catholic church as evidence to support its point. This argument implies that the vow of celibacy might be an outdated practice because it might lead to issues, like those that have occurred within the catholic church.

(CNN) -- In the shadows of Mount Redoubt, Alaskans are calmly waiting for the volcano to erupt -- an event that could occur at any time. Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano spews ash and steam during an eruption in 1989. \\"The level of seismic activity\\" has \\"increased markedly\\" in recent days at the 10,197-foot peak located about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, the state's most populous city, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. \\"We don't have a crystal ball,\\" said Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist with the observatory, which is aggressively monitoring the volcano. But \\"we expect based on the past behavior of this volcano that this activity is going to culminate in an eruption.\\" \\"It's not the closest volcano to Anchorage,\\" Cervelli said, but \\"it has the potential to disrupt air traffic at OPTIONS: - Alaska.\\" - Alaska Volcano Observatory.\\" - Alaskans.\\" - Anchorage.\\" - CNN.\\" - Mount Redoubt.\\" - Peter Cervelli.\\" - Volcano.\\"","completion":"\\"Anchorage.\\" The potential interruption stems from the ash clouds that can result from volcanic eruptions. Volcanic ash poses a severe risk to aviation, as the fine particulate matter can clog aircraft engines, leading to potential engine failure. Given the proximity of Mount Redoubt to Anchorage, which houses a significant airport hub, any major eruption could lead to flight cancellations and reroutes. These decisions would inevitably be driven by prevailing winds and the altitude to which the volcanic ash reaches. Besides, Anchorage was already affected by the 1989 eruption of Mount Redoubt, which caused hundreds of flight cancellations and reroutes. The city also experienced ashfall, which irritated eyes and respiratory systems, damaged cars and buildings, and incurred cleanup costs. Hence, there is a considerable concern about the disruptive potential of another eruption. Peter Cervelli and his team at the Alaska Volcano Observatory are closely monitoring the seismic activity of Mount Redoubt. The use of state-of-the-art equipment, including seismometers and GPS instruments, enables scientists to track the volcano's movements and detect signs of imminent eruption accurately. Their efforts are critical to providing as much warning as possible to communities potentially affected by an eruption. While the unpredictability of volcanic activity means that the exact timing and scale of an eruption cannot be pinpointed, the heightened seismic activity under Mount Redoubt is a clear indication that magma is moving beneath the volcano. This perception raises the alarm for a potential eruption, a reality with possibly significant impacts for the residents of Anchorage and all Alaskans who may be in the path of volcanic ash plume or its downstream effects.

Guilt can be productive; it can help us grow and mature and, most importantly, learn from our behavior when we offend or hurt others or ourselves. This type of guilt serves a purpose and encourages us to redirect our moral and/or behavioral compass. For example, if you said something offensive to a close friend over which you feel guilty because it upset them, you will learn not to say those types of things or else you risk losing friends. In other words, you will learn from your mistake. In this sense, then, the guilt has worked productively to positively reshape your behavior. To give another example, if you feel guilty because you ate an entire bag of chips, that's your brain's way of reminding you about a behavior you probably already know is unhealthy and can adversely affect your well-being. Thus, the rational feeling of guilt motivates you to reflect on and change your behavior for the better. Guilt can also be unproductive, in the sense that you feel guilt even when your behavior doesn't need reflection or transformation. This is irrational guilt that can devolve into a cycle where you begin to feel guilty when there is nothing to feel guilty about and you then ruminate on that guilt. For example, many first-time parents worry about going back to work because they think leaving their child with a nanny or in daycare will cause unknown damage to their child's mental and physical development. In reality, however, that's just not the case; in fact, most children develop normally irrespective of whether one or both parents work. There's nothing to really feel guilty about in this situation, but many people do, nevertheless. Put differently, this feeling of guilt doesn't produce anything but more irrational guilt. Unproductive guilt can have adverse effects on your cognitive well-being. For example, you may become overly self-critical, experience low self-esteem, and doubt your self-worth. It is important to recognize that sometimes we feel guilty for things over which we had no control, such as a car crash or not arriving in time to say goodbye to a loved one before he passed. Sometimes people involved in such traumatic events overestimate their knowledge of the event and what they could have done. In other words, these individuals think they could or should have done something but, in reality, could not have. These intense feelings of guilt can produce feelings of helplessness and a feeling of having lost control. For example, perhaps you feel guilty that you survived a car accident, while your friend was killed. This is known as survivor's guilt, which often emerges when we try to explain and make sense of traumatic events that we experience. In the case of serious guilt, you may want to seek professional help from a therapist who can help you work through your feelings of guilt. Engage in self-exploration to really get in touch with your feelings and to determine that it is guilt that you are experiencing and not another emotion. Studies using MRI scans of the brain have shown that guilt is an emotion that is distinct from shame or sadness. At the same time, these studies show that shame and sadness were often also present and correlate with guilt. Thus, it is important that you spend some time reflecting on your feelings in order to precisely pinpoint what you need to address. Define your thoughts, feelings, surroundings, and body sensations. You can do this cognitively, through the practice of mindfulness, meaning that you just focus on what you're feeling in that moment without judgement or reaction. Alternatively, you can write your feelings down in a journal. Writing out what you're experiencing can help you clarify those emotions as you try to put them into words. Example: I am feeling overwhelmed today with guilt, and I also feel sad. I can't stop thinking about it. I can tell that I’m stressed because I have a tension headache, tension in my shoulders, and a nervous feeling in my stomach. Think about what is causing these guilty feelings. Again, consider writing everything down to begin the process of working through the feeling of guilt. Here are some examples: \\"I let Fido out and he got run over by a car. I feel guilty that Fido is now dead because our whole family loved him so much.\\" \\"I didn't study for the exam and I got an F. I feel guilty that I let my parents down because they pay so much for me to go to school.\\" \\"I broke up with Bobby. I feel guilty that he hurts so much.\\" \\"My friend's mom passed away, and my mom is still alive and healthy. I feel guilty because my friend's life is in pieces and mine is perfect.\\" You will have to accept that you cannot change the past or what has happened. Acceptance also involves acknowledging difficulty and recognizing that you are able to withstand painful feelings in the present moment. This is the first stage in dealing appropriately with your guilt and moving forward. It is helpful to tell yourself affirming statements that emphasize acceptance and tolerance. Examples of these statements are: \\"I know dealing with guilt is hard, but for now I know I can endure.\\" \\"This is difficult, but I can accept what has happened and not fight or avoid this feeling - it is what it is.\\" Summary:","completion":"Guilt can be both productive and unproductive, depending on the situation and how it influences our behavior. Productive guilt helps us learn from our mistakes and redirects our moral and behavioral compass, leading to personal growth. Unproductive guilt, on the other hand, is irrational and can lead to negative psychological effects. To address feelings of guilt, it is important to engage in self-exploration and reflection to accurately identify the emotions being experienced. Defining thoughts, feelings, and body sensations can help in understanding the situation. Mindfulness or journaling may be useful tools in this process. Once the cause of the guilt is understood, acceptance of the situation and the inability to change the past is crucial. Affirming statements emphasizing acceptance and tolerance can help in coping with the difficult feelings related to guilt. If guilt becomes too overwhelming, seeking professional help from a therapist may be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987.

Adrian Sinbad is a wealthy owner of an oil company, and the descendant of a long-line of great mariners. He and a small group of people sail to the Bay of Bengal after learning that his oil rig had been sunk by a band of pirates.

Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house. Keep supplies in your car trunk or an outside storage shed if possible. Pack whatever your family is likely to need, enough for three days to a week, including food, water, medication, first aid and personal hygiene supplies, flashlights, a portable radio, blankets, clothes and shoes, cash, or camp stove, candles, matches or lighters, and a whistle.

For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.

Removing yourself from the possibility of running into the bully can help avoid their insults altogether. Take a new route when leaving class, increase your privacy online and make sure you're never alone with the bully unless necessary. If you're in a class together, ask if your teacher can sit you away from them. You can also ask to leave a few minutes early so you can avoid them when walking out. If the bullying occurs in the breakroom or on your walk to class, go with a friend. The bully is less likely to be mean to you in the presence of someone else. If you want, you can tell your friend what's going on with the bully or you can just simply ask them to walk with you. Tune that bully out by listening to that new album you like or watching videos on YouTube. This will drown out any insults they might be hurling at you while giving you an opportunity to do something fun. Killing two birds with one stone! Maybe you're in your room or at work when the bully begins going off. Do something else! Fold up clothes when your big sister is being mean or tidy up your desk if your coworker is at it again.

We have the equation -4693*i + 144988 = -8680 + 23987 - 29881. First, let's add and subtract the numbers on the right side of the equation. We have: -8680 + 23987 - 29881 = -578 Now the equation looks like this: -4693*i + 144988 = -578. We want to find the value of i. So, we need to get i alone on one side of the equation. Let's move 144988 to the right side. To do that, we'll subtract 144988 from both sides. Here's what that looks like: -4693*i = -144988 - 578 Now let's add the numbers on the right side: -144988 - 578 = -145566 So now we have -4693*i = -145566. The last step to find the value of i is to divide both sides of the equation by -4693: i = -145566 / -4693 And when we divide those numbers, we get: i = 31 So the answer is i = 31.

The question is related to the Watergate scandal that took place during the presidency of Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. It seeks to identify the press secretary who, in an attempt to minimize the political impact of the scandal, downplayed the seriousness of the Watergate break-in. The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex led to revelations of widespread corruption in the Nixon administration and ultimately culminated in his resignation in 1974.

A £25million-a-year deal is expected to be finalised by Christmas. The negotiations with the big spending airline, famous for its Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant TV adverts, were first revealed by Sports Agenda last September. The money would be a significant advance on the £18m-a-year Samsung currently pay to have their name on Chelsea shirts and would propel the club above Liverpool and Arsenal in the PL shirt sponsorship table.

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich wants his club — hot favourites to be crowned champions — to be as dominant on football’s commercial side as they are on the pitch. But the west London club, already deep in talks with Turkish Airlines before former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow was brought in to revamp the commercial operation, still lag well behind Manchester United. The Old Trafford shirt sponsorship with Chevrolet, that began this season, is worth £53m annually. Barcelona have had their shirts sponsored by Turkish Airlines in the past. Spreading their wings: Turkish Airlines linked up with Manchester United.

Lessons of New York’s Prison Escape It’s a good thing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a corruption inquiry at the maximum security prison in northern New York where prison workers smuggled in tools, including hacksaw blades, that helped two convicted murderers to escape last month. The escape, from the Clinton Correctional Facility, shows how easy it is for guards and workers to bypass screening systems that are supposed to keep drugs, weapons and other contraband out of jails and prisons. This problem goes far beyond one horribly mismanaged prison in New York. Controlling smuggling by corrections officers is difficult, because other officers either turn a blind eye to it or fail to enforce security protocols that are meant to prevent it. This problem was underscored in an alarming report issued last fall on New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex by the city’s Department of Investigation. The report revealed that an investigator posing as a guard was able to smuggle large quantities of drugs, along with alcohol and a razor blade, into the Rikers complex. The undercover investigator was able to walk into all six of the Rikers jails he attempted to enter with the pockets of his cargo pants bulging with heroin, pain killers and marijuana. In reviewing videotape of shift changes, investigators saw uniformed guards walking through metal detectors carrying plastic bags that had not been scanned with the X-ray machine. The report said that weapons and narcotics remained easily available to any inmate with enough money to pay for them. Mark Peters, the commissioner for the Department of Investigation, added that officers and civilian staff members often did not sell the drugs directly to inmates but served as couriers, shuttling contraband between people on the outside and the inmates for a fee. The department recommended more measures to prevent illegal conduct by guards, like placing drug sniffing dogs at staff entrances and putting employee lockers outside the gates, to prevent civilian clothing and other items from ever entering the jail. The problem at Rikers was also the case at the Clinton prison, where two prison employees have been criminally charged with smuggling in chisels, hacksaw blades and other tools to the inmates without any difficulty. So far, a dozen Clinton prison workers have been placed on administrative leave, the superintendent has been replaced and tighter security measures like weekly cell inspections imposed. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also ordered the state inspector general to investigate what happened at Clinton. The F.B.I. is on the right track in focusing on possible criminal conduct by employees and inmates, including drug trafficking. If the prison was so porous that it could allow in tools, more lucrative contraband could find its way in as well. It makes sense for officials to look beyond the circumstances that led to the Clinton escape and beyond Clinton itself to other prisons in the system. These kinds of failures are not limited to New York. After all, it has often been shown nationally that when jails and prisons are awash in drugs, it’s because corrections officers are at the root of the problem.

The design is outdated and could significantly benefit from an update to align with modern app standards. Issues with the app's speed and responsiveness compounded the issue, leading to an overall frustrating experience. Additionally, the app touts its ability to provide extensive information through log-reading, but I was disappointed with the actual depth of the features offered. The log filters appeared to be quite limited and were not customizable to fit my needs.

Police investigator Knud Hvass says it is too early to say whether the perpetrator of the theft at the Cafe 33 bar had broken in or had used a key. Nothing else was stolen. Hvass said Wednesday police were notified of the theft on Tuesday. Denmark's TV2 says the bottle of Russo-Baltique is made of 3 kilograms (6.6. pounds) of gold and the equivalent amount of silver with a diamond-encrusted cap. Bar owner Brian Ingberg whose bar has 1,200 vodka bottles, told Denmark's Ekstra Bladet tabloid that the bottle resembles a vintage car front.

Answer the following question: The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon. Which area experiences less soil erosion? Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Answer:","completion":"The Valley experiences less soil erosion compared to the Gorge. The Valley has fertile soil, abundant trees and bushes, and increased productivity over the past decade. It also has higher biodiversity, which makes the ecosystem more adaptable and able to withstand disasters. In contrast, the Gorge has suffered negative effects due to deforestation, leading to poor soil quality, a decline in biodiversity, and increased susceptibility to soil erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Due to being an irresponsible adult who doesn’t understand the concept of saving money, my brother doesn’t have a car at the moment. He’s currently struggling getting to and from work, because his job (which is near where I live) is a 20 minute drive from his home. On public transportation, that’s about an hour and a half commute. At first I didn’t mind helping him out, because despite his flaws that have led him to this situation, he’s my brother and I want to be there for him. But it’s turned into a weekly thing, where at least twice a week he’s either asking me for rides, asking to borrow my car for days, or asking if I can lend him money. Sometimes I’m busy, and sometimes I just really don’t feel like it. I’m currently on break from school, so it’s not like I have an excuse to not want to let him borrow my car, I just don’t want to. I want to be able to know that it’s in my possession ready for me to use if I need it for whatever reason, even if it’s just to go to a friends house.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what makes food for themselves and other organisms?\\" is \\"honeybees\\", given that most plants make food for themselves and other organisms? A:","completion":"No, \\"honeybees\\" would not be the correct answer to the question \\"what makes food for themselves and other organisms?\\" While honeybees do produce honey, which serves as a food source for themselves and other organisms, they are not the primary organisms responsible for making food for themselves and others. Instead, you are right to point out that most plants are the main organisms that make food for themselves, as well as providing a foundation of energy and nutrients for other living organisms within ecosystems. This process is called photosynthesis. Plants, being autotrophs, can convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose – a type of sugar that can be used as an energy source – and oxygen as a byproduct. This glucose serves as the primary source of energy for the plants themselves, allowing them to grow and reproduce. In addition, the glucose they produce also serves as a crucial energy source for heterotrophs (organisms that cannot produce their own food), like animals and insects, including honeybees. So, a more accurate answer to the question would be \\"plants,\\" given their ability to produce food for themselves and a wide range of other organisms through the process of photosynthesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks during the Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Oct. 24, 2018. (Handout ./Reuters) The Saudi government has come under intense criticism for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some Saudi social media users have come up with a way to fight back: boycotting Amazon.com. Over the past few days, Saudi Twitter users have used hashtags such as #BoycottAmazon and #مقاطعة_امازون_وسوق_دوت_كوم to encourage their compatriots and allies to stop using Amazon as well as Souq, an online retailer bought by Amazon last year. According to Bloomberg News, the calls for a boycott topped Twitter’s trending topics in Saudi Arabia for several hours Sunday. The boycott effort appears to be linked to The Washington Post’s coverage of the killing of Khashoggi, who was a contributing columnist to the newspaper. Post owner Jeffrey P. Bezos is the founder and chief executive of Amazon. Some of the tweets justified a boycott by saying that Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, are under attack.

He was killed Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to get a document he needed for his planned marriage. The journalist’s disappearance — and the kingdom’s belated admission that he was killed at the consulate — caused a global publicity crisis for Saudi Arabia and Mohammed. Riyadh has repeatedly denied that the crown prince had any knowledge of a plan to kill Khashoggi, but many observers find that claim unlikely. Still, many Saudis still support Mohammed: “What happened to Khashoggi is terrible and goes against Islam,\\" one Saudi citizen in the town of Ad Dilam said to The Post last week. \\"Our crown prince did not do that. We trust him, and we feel the changes he has made for us.” It’s unclear how much the Amazon boycott drive represents popular opinion in Saudi Arabia. The country has one of the most active Twitter user bases in the Arab world, but analysts say the use of pro-government bots is widespread and often designed to get certain messages onto trending lists. Many of the tweets calling for a boycott of Amazon used similar if not identical language, suggesting some degree of coordination. Some users also used the hashtags to criticize the call for boycott, saying it would not make a difference. #مقاطعه_امازون_وسوق_دوت_كوم who ever created this hashtag clearly knows nothin about world economics, you really think not buying headphone with ur 20 riyals would bring Jeff bezos to his knees! — Dr. Hamoud Somaily (@HamoudSomaily) November 5, 2018 Amazon had been looking toward Saudi Arabia as an area of potential growth. The retailer began hiring for new positions in Riyadh this year after Bezos met with Mohammed in Seattle in March. It also used Souq, which is widely used in Saudi Arabia, to offer access to Amazon.

The boycott call is one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter in Saudi Arabia. ADVERTISEMENT Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Saudi journalist, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October. Saudi Arabia's explanations for his death have shifted several times. The kingdom first denied any role in Khashoggi's disappearance, saying he left the consulate on his own. Saudi officials later said his death was a premeditated murder. The Post's coverage of Khashoggi's death has highlighted the lack of accountability regarding the alleged perpetrators. On Friday, the Post published an op-ed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said there were still unanswered questions about Khashoggi's death. \\"Where is Khashoggi’s body?\\" Erdogan wrote. \\"Who gave the order to kill this kind soul?\\" \\"Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions,\\" he added.

Updated at 2:35 p.m. ||||| Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia at the Pentagon in March. (Cliff Owen/AP) Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the president of Turkey. [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: Suudi Arabistan’ın, Cemal Kaşıkçı’nın öldürülmesi hakkında hâlâ cevaplaması gereken birçok soru var] The story is all too familiar: Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a family man, entered Saudi Arabia’s Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 for marriage formalities. No one – not even his fiancee, who was waiting outside the compound — has ever seen him again. Over the course of the past month, Turkey has moved heaven and earth to shed light on all aspects of this case. As a result of our efforts, the world has learned that Khashoggi was killed in cold blood by a death squad, and it has been established that his murder was premeditated. Yet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act. Where is Khashoggi’s body? Who is the “local collaborator” to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi’s remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions. We know the perpetrators are among the 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia. We also know those individuals came to carry out their orders: Kill Khashoggi and leave. Finally, we know the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government. Some seem to hope this “problem” will go away in time. But we will keep asking those questions, which are crucial to the criminal investigation in Turkey, but also to Khashoggi’s family and loved ones. A month after his killing, we still do not know where his body is. At the very least, he deserves a proper burial in line with Islamic customs. We owe it to his family and friends, including his former colleagues at The Post, to give them an opportunity to say their goodbyes and pay their respects to this honorable man. To ensure that the world will keep asking the same questions, we have shared the evidence with our friends and allies, including the United States. As we continue to look for answers, I would like to stress that Turkey and Saudi Arabia enjoy friendly relations. I do not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit on Khashoggi. Therefore, I have no reason to believe that his murder reflected Saudi Arabia’s official policy. In this sense, it would be wrong to view the Khashoggi slaying as a “problem” between two countries. Nonetheless, I must add that our friendship with Riyadh, which goes back a long time, doesn’t mean we will turn a blind eye to the premeditated murder that unfolded in front of our very eyes. The killing of Khashoggi is inexplicable. Had this atrocity taken place in the United States or elsewhere, authorities in those countries would have gotten to the bottom of what happened. It would be out of the question for us to act any other way. No one should dare to commit such acts on the soil of a NATO ally again. If anyone chooses to ignore that warning, they will face severe consequences. The Khashoggi murder was a clear violation and a blatant abuse of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Failure to punish the perpetrators could set a very dangerous precedent. This is another reason we were shocked and saddened by the efforts of certain Saudi officials to cover up Khashoggi’s premeditated murder rather than serve the cause of justice, as our friendship would require. Though Riyadh has detained 18 suspects, it is deeply concerning that no action has been taken against the Saudi consul general, who lied through his teeth to the media and fled Turkey shortly afterward. Likewise, the refusal of the Saudi public prosecutor — who recently visited his counterpart in Istanbul — to cooperate with the investigation and answer even simple questions is very frustrating. His invitation of Turkish investigators to Saudi Arabia for more talks about the case felt like a desperate and deliberate stalling tactic. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi involves a lot more than a group of security officials, just as the Watergate scandal was bigger than a break-in and the 9/11 terror attacks went beyond the hijackers. As responsible members of the international community, we must reveal the identities of the puppetmasters behind Khashoggi’s killing and discover those in whom Saudi officials — still trying to cover up the murder — have placed their trust.

Blue/Bloomberg Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg Saudis who are angry at The Washington Post’s coverage of the kingdom in the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder are calling for a boycott of Amazon.com Inc. because of its shared ownership by U.S. billionaire Jeff Bezos. \\"Boycott Amazon\\" was the top trending hashtag on Twitter in Saudi Arabia for several hours on Sunday, as users circulated images showing the deletion of the Amazon smartphone app. They also called for a boycott of regional subsidiary Souq.com, acquired by Amazon last year. Neither Amazon nor The Washington Post were immediately available for comment. Many citizens have felt that their country is under attack since Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, a Post columnist and insider turned critic, at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. They’ve been particularly upset by an op-ed article by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently published in the Post, and by the newspaper’s coverage -- along with other international media -- of gruesome information about the murder obtained from anonymous Turkish officials. ‘Media War’ “It became clear before our eyes that this is an organized media war,\\" said Bandar Otyf, a Saudi journalist with more than 100,000 Twitter followers who was among those calling for the boycott. “As Twitter users and activists and citizens, we don’t have power abroad, but we have simple things like boycotting.\\" Many Saudis are learning for the first time that Bezos, the founder and chairman of Amazon, separately owns the Washington Post, Otyf said, adding that “if we affect even a portion of their business, we’re satisfied.\\" While few in Saudi Arabia use Amazon directly, Souq.com is popular. Last year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund invested in a competing e-commerce firm called Noon, which was founded by the chairman of Emaar Properties. Some tweets about the boycott appeared to be automated or copied and pasted. \\"I was so excited for Black Friday! But unfortunately since #Washingtonpost is double standards against my country #saudiArabia and support propaganda of Erdogan I decide to stop any plans to buy anything in @amazon,\\" one such tweet read. It was repeated eight times on different accounts with the same spelling errors.

Thousands of social media users in Saudi Arabia backed calls for a boycott of Amazon ( AMZN ) and its regional subsidiary on Monday. Bezos owns the Washington Post and is still by far the biggest shareholder in Amazon. Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Saudi officials first denied all knowledge of his fate before admitting later that his killing was premeditated murder. The Post has been demanding information about Khashoggi's death and justice for his killers. It described Saudi Arabia's version of events as a \\"coverup\\" last month. On Friday, the Post published an op-ed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan where he wrote : \\"The order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\\" Saudis have used Twitter and local media outlets to denounce what they described as a \\"media campaign\\" aimed at tarnishing Saudi Arabia's image and undermining efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernize the country.

Amazon doesn't have a big presence in the Middle East but the company last year bought Souq.com , the region's leading e-commerce platform based in Dubai, to extend its reach. \\"Boycott Amazon and Souq.com\\" was one of the top trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia on Monday. By 4:30 pm in Riyadh (8:30 am ET), it had been mentioned in over 8,000 tweets. \\"It's not acceptable, the [Amazon] owner is the same owner of the paper that attacks our nation and its leaders,\\" said another Twitter user. Bezos has so far not spoken out about the killing, but the Post's publisher Fred Ryan has kept up the pressure on the Saudi authorities. Ryan said on Thursday Khashoggi was \\"lured into a death trap.\\" He also announced an initiative — the Press Freedom Partnership — to \\"increase awareness of the importance of an independent press.\\" One Twitter user said he was not going to join the boycott. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In response to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some Saudi social media users have started a boycott campaign against Amazon.com and its regional subsidiary, Souq.com.

A Cambridge University educated research scientist is so desperate to live the life of a wheelchair-bound person she is prepared to pay a doctor help her become disabled. Since childhood, Chloe Jennings-White has made several attempts at injuring herself so she can finally climb into her own wheelchair. In 2010 she even found a doctor overseas willing to help her become disabled by cutting her sciatic. and femoral nerves, but she could not afford the £16,000 costs. Scroll down for video. Chloe Jennings-White adjusting her leg braces at her home on May 16, 2013, in Salt Lake City, Utah. She uses a wheelchair, even though her legs are fine, and has chosen to live as a disabled person, due to a rare condition. 'I might never be able to afford it, but I know, truly and deeply, I won't regret it if I ever can,' she said, referring to the doctor who might be able to help her become disabled. Chloe, 58, from Salt Lake City, Utah, suffers from a rare condition called Body Integrity Identity Disorder, or BIID. Sufferers do not accept one of their own limb or limbs and seek to amputate them or become paraplegic. Able to stand: Chloe, 58, pictured out hiking in May this year in Salt Lake City, Utah. She wears leg braces and uses a wheelchair, even though her legs are healthy. Some experts believe it is caused by a neurological fault, in which the brain's mapping system cannot see a certain body part. The Cambridge graduate believes both of her legs do not belong to her and dreams of being paralysed from the waist down. 'Something in my brain tells me my legs are not supposed to work,' she said. 'Having any sensation in them just feels wrong.' For years she bandaged herself secretly, but now lives openly with her condition despite facing intolerance, insults, and sometimes online threats. Chloe first realised she was different at the age of four, after visiting her Aunt Olive, who was using leg braces after a bike accident. 'I wanted them too,' she said. 'I wondered why I wasn't born needing them and felt something was wrong with me because I didn't have them.' At the age of nine, Chloe even took action and pedalled her bike off a four-foot high acting stage on Hampstead Heath, north London, landing on her neck. 'I only wanted to stop my legs working but could have broken my neck or died,' she added. From then on, Chloe lived out her fantasy in secret, pretending to be disabled when alone, playing risky sports and climbing trees in the hope of hurting her legs. Without her leg brace on in her bathroom in Salt Lake City, US. Her distorted body image causes her to sit in a wheelchair even though she can stand and ski. Now, as an adult, Chloe enjoys the. excitement of downhill skiing and the possibility she might fall and. suffer serious leg fractures. 'I ski extremely fast, and aim for the most dangerous runs,' she said. BIID occurs when a person's idea of how they should look does not match their actual physical form. The condition affects just a small percentage of the population. The sufferer wants to have an amputation. In most cases, the limb that the person would like removed is healthy. Many psychologists and neurologists have tried to understand what the root cause of the condition is. The theory is that BIID occurs when the brain is not able to provide an accurate plan of the body. Some experts believe the cause to be psychological. One. theory is that a person with BIID may have seen an amputee at an. earlier age and this image has replaced their own thoughts about what. constitutes the ideal person. To become a better person they feel that a certain limb will have to be amputated. In severe cases, a person with BIID may harm the limb they wish to be removed or force doctors into removing it. Others manage to cope with the illness by using canes and prosthetic attachments to help them feel complete. 'Doing. any activity that brings a chance of me becoming paraplegic gives me a. sense of relief from the anxiety caused by the BIID. 'My. friends and family can get a little worried about me skiing, as they. know I ski very aggressively and they know that in the back of my mind I. actually want to get paralysed.' Chloe had a real skiing accident seven years ago, which left her with a minor back injury and a reason to get leg braces. She researched the braces online and came across BIID for the first time. She discovered there were others like her. 'It was a huge relief,' she said. 'I wasn't a freak - there were hundreds of others like me.' She took part in a BIID research study. with psychiatrist Michael First, from New York, who diagnosed her in. Spring 2008 and recommending she use a wheelchair. At first, she used the chair in private, but eventually gained the courage to reveal her secret to friends and work colleagues. 'The. chair gives me psychological relief, instead of physical,' she said. 'I. know it can be difficult for people without BIID to understand, but. it's what we feel.' In 2009 she was involved in a serious. 75mph car crash and suffered pre-concussion amnesia and cannot remember. the 15 minutes before the impact. It was not a deliberate act, according to police. reports, but she worries she might have subconsciously wanted it to happen. Now,. Chloe spends most of her time in a wheelchair, but has to get out for. various household tasks and walk down the steps to her car. With her doctor, Dr Mark Malan. He is helping her with her condition Body Integrity Identity Disorder, or BIID. Chloe is a research scientist and graduate from Cambridge University. 'I can't afford to convert my home for disabled access so I just use the chair as much as I can,' she said. She fantasises about having a car crash without hurting anyone else just so she can damage her own legs. 'Any time when I'm driving I sort of conjure up accident scenarios in my mind where I will become paraplegic,' she admitted. Psychiatrist Dr Mark Malan, who treats Chloe, said: 'The question I often ask is, is it better to have somebody pretending to use a wheelchair, or to commit suicide? Chloe Jennings-White pictured hiking with her friend David Allen earlier this year in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she now lives. She is rarely seen out of her wheelchair. Chloe sitting with her friend Clover and her baby boy Randi (pictured right) back in May at her home in Salt Lake City, Utah. Friends and family worry about her as they know she wants to self harm. Cambridge graduate Chloe outside her workplace, the University of Utah, US. She sometimes has to get out of her chair to walk up stairs or get into a car. 'One possibility could be to do some sort of nerve blocking so that that limb could not actually be used for a period of time, to let the patient test the reality of being physically disabled temporarily. 'It would give BIID sufferers a chance to change their minds if they wanted to.'

Write an article based on this summary: – The conservative response to Occupy Wall Street is here, in the form of a Tumblr called \\"We Are the 53%.\\" Referring to the 53% of Americans who pay federal income taxes, the blog is a direct counter to the Occupiers' similar \\"We Are the 99%\\" site and operates on the assumption that the Occupiers are among the other 46%. Conceived by RedState.org founder and CNN correspondent Erick Erickson, the Tumblr frequently features messages like, \\"Suck it up you whiners,\\" and conveys a sense of pride in paying taxes—an interesting message coming from conservatives, who are traditionally not fans of forking over money to Uncle Sam, notes the Washington Post. But a co-founder of the Tumblr says that paying taxes is simply \\"the responsible thing to do,\\" and that whether or not taxes are too high is another question entirely. Over on Gawker, Max Read finds the whole thing depressing. \\"What makes 'We Are the 53%' so heartbreaking isn't that its contributors are enormous jerks—it's that so many of them could just as easily be writing in to 'We Are the 99%,'\\" he writes. Contributors post stories about having no health insurance and barely affording rent, \\"but not as a cry for help or an indictment of a broken system. Here, it's a badge of pride. ... And if any of those problems are directly attributable to reckless, self-serving behavior on the part of enormous banking conglomerates, for God's sake don't blame them! You are the 53%!\\"","completion":"Title: The Conservative Counter to Occupy Wall Street: We Are the 53% Introduction Following the Occupy Wall Street movement's \\"We Are the 99%\\" campaign, conservatives have launched a counter-narrative: \\"We Are the 53%.\\" This grassroots initiative is a direct challenge to the Occupy Wall Street narrative that speaks from the perspective of the 53% of Americans who pay federal income tax. Conceived by Erick Erickson, founder of RedState.org and a CNN correspondent, the blog features messages such as \\"Suck it up you whiners\\" and takes pride in paying taxes. The Emphasis on Taxpaying One of the most noteworthy aspects of the \\"We Are the 53%\\" movement is the pride in paying federal income taxes. This is an unusual message from conservatives, who have traditionally expressed disdain for contributing money to the federal government. However, the founders of the Tumblr blog argue that their focus on tax-paying isn't contradictory. They believe that paying taxes is the responsible thing to do, but this doesn't mean they support high tax rates. The issue of tax rates, they argue, should be separate from the broader discussion surrounding social responsibility. The Depressing Nature of \\"We Are the 53%\\" Max Read, a contributor at Gawker, has described the 53% initiative as depressing. What makes the movement disheartening, Read writes, is that many of the contributors could just as easily be members of the Occupy Wall Street's \\"99%.\\" Rather than seeing their stories as a call for help, the 53% view their financial struggles as a badge of pride. This mindset prevents people from holding accountable the large banking conglomerates whose reckless and self-serving behavior has caused widespread hardship. Instead, the 53% claim responsibility for their own financial situations and place blame squarely on their own shoulders. A Complex Narrative: Pride vs. Advocacy The rise of \\"We Are the 53%\\" reveals a complicated conflict within the conservative camp. On one hand, these individuals express pride in their contributions to society by paying taxes and taking responsibility for their lives. They argue that government handouts only serve to undermine individual work ethic and encourage dependency. On the other side, Occupy Wall Street's 99% movement seeks to expose the massive wealth inequality and corporate greed that has left so many struggling to make ends meet.

Select from the following. 1. no; 2. yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Is {a,a} equal to {a}? To answer this question, we need to understand the concept and definition of a set in mathematics. A set is defined as a collection of distinct objects, called elements, which are neither ordered nor repeated. In a set, each element can only appear once. With this definition in mind, we can analyze the given sets. In the first set, {a,a}, \\"a\\" is repeated twice. However, as we just learned, a set cannot have duplicate elements. Therefore, the set {a,a}, when simplified, becomes {a}. Now, comparing the simplified version of the first set to the second set {a}, we find that they are equal, as both sets only consist of a single element 'a'. So, the answer to Question 1 is \\"yes\\", {a,a} is equal to {a}. Question 2: What is [math]sqrt{x^2}[/math] equal to? For this question, we need to understand the concept of square roots and exponentiation. When we square a number or variable (raise it to the power of 2), it is denoted as x^2. The process of finding the square root is essentially the inverse of squaring. Mathematically, the square root of a number squared (x^2) would be written as √(x^2). In this case, the square of any real number x is equal to x^2, and the square root of x^2 is equal to the absolute value of x, denoted as |x|. This is because the square of both a positive and a negative number x will be positive, and their square roots will return the non-negative value of x. Hence, the answer to Question 2 is that [math]sqrt{x^2}[/math] is equal to |x|, the absolute value of x. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? Given the information discussed above, it is clear that Questions 1 and 2 are addressing different concepts. While Question 1 is focusing on set theory and understanding the simplification of sets containing duplicate elements, Question 2 is dealing with mathematical operations involving square roots and exponentiation. So, the answer is \\"no\\", Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, as they explore different mathematical concepts and principles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Jimbo and Jedd are both farmers who have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. Jimbo's products have been in high demand recently, so he has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town. But I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. What is an answer for this question: Who will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes? The answer is:","completion":"Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes due to his decreased use of fertilizers on his farm. The background information provided explains that large amounts of chemicals such as fertilizers can be picked up by rainwater, and runoff then carries these chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. When dissolved fertilizer enters water bodies, it can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, which ultimately can result in dead zones where marine life cannot survive. In the present situation, Jimbo and Jedd both have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. However, the demand for Jimbo's products has increased significantly, causing him to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his crops. This could result in substantial chemical runoff entering the lake downstream from Jimbo's farm, thereby increasing the likelihood of a dead zone forming due to excessive growth of water plants and algae. On the other hand, Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm because the demand for his products has decreased in his town. With less fertilizer being used on Jedd's crops, the amount of chemical runoff entering the lake downstream from Jedd's farm will be significantly reduced. Consequently, the risk of a dead zone forming in Jedd's lake is lower compared to Jimbo's lake. Moreover, the potential for groundwater contamination from these fertilizers is also an important consideration. The background information highlighted that chemicals can infiltrate groundwater, and this contaminated water may then come up in water wells, posing a risk to human health if ingested. While both Jimbo and Jedd have wells downstream from their farms, Jedd's reduced fertilizer usage will mean there is a lower risk of groundwater contamination and hence, a lower risk to human health, considering the relationship between contaminated water and adverse health effects. In conclusion, Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes due to his decreased use of fertilizers compared to Jimbo, who has increased his fertilizer usage. Additionally, Jedd's reduced fertilizer use will result in a lower risk of groundwater contamination and minimize potential harm to human health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A ceremony was also held as the hall's South Steps were renamed the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Steps. On Sunday, there will be remembrance services and on Monday a two-minute silence to mark Armistice Day. In the Middle East, more than 100 RAF service personnel from the 83 Expeditionary Air Group were among the first to mark the commemoration, with a sunset ceremony at their base. At noon on Saturday, Afghan war widows marched with widows from World War Two, the Korean War and the Gulf War to the Cenotaph in Whitehall for a 30-minute service. And football grounds across the country paused shortly before the afternoon fixtures as a minute's silence was observed. This year's Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance also marked the 70th anniversaries of the Battle of the Atlantic and the Dambuster raids. A television audience of 5.2 million is expected to watch the event on BBC One which featured performances by singer James Blunt, Katie Melua, the tenor Alfie Boe and new group, the Poppy Girls. As well as the Queen and Prince Philip, other members of the Royal Family attended, including the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The event saw tributes from performers interspersed with real-life stories from former and serving forces personnel, including the last Dambuster. Squadron Leader Johnny Johnson was given a standing ovation and applauded for more than a minute as he stood with the Torch of Remembrance. There was also a standing ovation for the Chelsea Pensioners, with the Queen and duke rising to their feet as the men marched into the hall. The Poppy Girls, an all-girl group picked from a search for talent among forces families, performed their new single The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye) which is raising money for the Poppy Appeal. The Queen seemed particularly pleased to witness an emotional reunion for one of the young members of the group. Megan Adams, 10, from Stirling, was not expecting to see her father, Lieutenant Commander Billy Adams, for another three months as he has been serving with the Royal Navy in the Seychelles as part of an anti-piracy task force.

They may have failed to officially set a new record because they were a man down when they finished but later, as they gathered in Downing Street, David Cameron wondered whether the record keepers could be persuaded to let their better time stand. Ahead of this weekend's events Prince Harry and Prince Philip visited the Field of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey to pay their respects and observe a two-minute silence. On Saturday morning, Commando 999 raised money for the \\"Royal Marines Family\\" by attempting to break the world speed march record. They tried to carry kit and weapons weighing over 40lbs (18kg) 26.2 miles (42km) through central London in under four hours 19 minutes to commemorate the Royal Marines' 350th birthday. The Royal Marines were quicker than previous attempts but did not beat the record as one man had to pull out half a mile before the end. They completed the race around London in four hours, 17 minutes and 21 seconds. They raised more than Â£20,000 to help Royal Marines who have been affected mentally and physically by war.

Under her influence, schools were built and children were formally instructed in reading and Christian doctrine. Between 1770 and 1813 some 7,300 ha (18,000 acres) of land on the hills were enclosed, mainly with dry stone walls that today form a key part of the landscape.

Richard Barlow, 24, from Big Arowry, North Wales, enticed ‘naive’ youngsters by posing as the 19-year-old American megastar in online chat-rooms and music sites. A court heard Barlow, who has been jailed for three years, also pretended to be a teenage boy and even a young girl to meet children where he encouraged them to strip and perform sex acts over Skype. Richard Barlow (left), 24, posed as pop star Justin Bieber to groom girls as young as seven over the internet. He groomed children aged between seven and 11 for his own sexual gratification and even used headphones and cameras to record them. Barlow blackmailed some victims by threatening to upload films he had already made of them for family and friends to see if they did not do as he said. When police raided his home and seized his computer they found a shocking video of him enticing a seven-year-old girl to perform a sex act on herself via a webcam. He was arrested and charged with inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, three charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child over the Internet and 12 charges of making indecent images. On Wednesday at Mold Crown Court he pleaded guilty to all charges and was jailed for three years. Barlow was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life. Sentencing Judge Peter Heywood said: ‘It is clear that for a significant period of time you have had an unhealthy interest in this sort of activity. ‘You engaged in conversation with young girls to encourage them to engage in sexual activity with them. ‘Heaven knows how they will be affected in their future lives. They may seem to be only images but they are young children being exploited by others. ‘Huge sums of money are made by people who have a prurient interest in this sort of material. ‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did anything other than pass an immediate custodial sentence.’ On Wednesday at Mold Crown Court Barlow pleaded guilty to all charges and was jailed for three years. Prosecutor Jonathan Austin told the court police seized computer equipment when they executed a search warrant at the address in September 2012. He said Barlow, who lived with his parents, also had a fetish for feet and persuaded other girls to show their feet via his webcam.

Save your money for something better! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The review provided clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. There are several reasons why this is the case, as detailed below: 1. The reviewer's initial impression of the product is negative, indicated by the title \\"Absolute junk.\\" This strong choice of words sets the tone for the rest of the review, making it clear that the product did not live up to their expectations. 2. The reviewer goes on to explain that the product was broken right out of the box, which further contributes to the negative perception of the product. A product that is damaged or non-functional upon purchase can lead to a frustrating experience for the consumer, further contributing to an unflattering review. 3. The mention of the lost receipt and the inability to return or exchange the product adds to the reviewer's dissatisfaction. It suggests that the customer felt stuck with a useless product, which may have amplified their negative emotions towards the item. 4. In line with this, the reviewer compares purchasing the product to \\"flushing 6.00 down the toilet.\\" This metaphor conveys a strong sense of regret and waste, implying that the product is not only disappointing but also not worth the money spent on it. 5. The review concludes with a recommendation for potential buyers to save their money for something better. This conclusive statement implies that the product is not worth anyone's time or investment, discouraging others from considering it as a viable option. In summary, the review portrays the product in a highly unflattering light, highlighting various negative aspects such as poor quality, broken condition upon purchase, frustration with the inability to return the item, wasted investment, and a recommendation against purchasing it altogether. This negative depiction may have a significant impact on potential buyers and their decision-making process, potentially steering them away from the product in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","completion":"The sentence with all lower case letters would be as follows: \\"this pagoda festival is held for more than one month from the second week of june to the third of july (nayone to waso).\\" While the task requested seems simple, modifications in text like this could impact various factors. In written English, capitalization plays an integral role as it's not just a matter of style but also can affect the meaning of sentences. Here are several ways capitalization is essential and why we usually use it: 1. To start a sentence: The first letter of the first word in a sentence should always be capitalized. For example, the sentence \\"This pagoda festival is held for more than one month from the second week of June to the third of July (Nayone to Waso)\\" starts with a capital 'T' in 'This'. 2. Capitalizing proper nouns: A proper noun denotes a specific person, place, or thing that has a name and is unique. 'June' and 'July' are the names of specific months; thus they are proper nouns and need to be capitalized. 3. Title Capitalization: It is used in the title of books, movies, articles, etc. Each major word in the title is capitalized. 4. Capitalizing acronyms and abbreviations: It is usually done to form an abbreviation or acronym. 5. Honorifics and names: Words used in front of names like 'Dr.', 'Mrs.', 'President' are capitalized. In the sentence provided, the real reason 'This,' 'June,' and 'July' are capitalized is that the first is the starter of the sentence, and the other two are proper nouns. Changing them to lower case could potentially make it harder to understand the sentence depending on the context it is used in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In transipration, at warmer temperatures water molecules move faster, and the rate of evaporation from stomata is therefore much faster. Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are cooler or warmer ): Donna wants to have her water molecules move faster through transpiration, so she will make the temperature cooler or warmer? A:","completion":"Donna wants to have her water molecules move faster through transpiration, so she will make the temperature warmer. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water in the form of vapor through tiny pores called stomata, mainly found on the surfaces of leaves. This process is essential for plants, as it helps in cooling the plant, facilitates the uptake and transportation of essential nutrients, and maintains the turgor pressure in plant cells, among other functions. As mentioned in the passage, at warmer temperatures, water molecules move at a faster rate, leading to increased evaporation from the stomata. This means that the rate of transpiration will be higher in warmer conditions compared to cooler conditions. When the temperature is warmer, more kinetic energy is available for the water molecules, causing them to move more rapidly and evaporate more quickly from the stomata. As a result, the entire process of transpiration is accelerated. Therefore, if Donna wants to increase the rate at which water molecules move through transpiration, she should aim to create a warmer environment for her plants. This will enhance the movement of water molecules and promote faster evaporation, leading to an increased transpiration rate. However, it is important to note that excessively high temperatures may lead to negative effects on the plant's overall health and productivity, so a balance should be maintained to ensure the optimal growth and functioning of the plant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\" quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health. Question: What can we learn from the text? Options: A: Eating fatty food has immediate effects on your heart. B: The EPA conducted many studies on air quality. C: Moderate air quality is more harmful than smoking, D: Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made. Answer:","completion":"D: Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made. Step-by-step justification: 1. The article discusses the effects of environmental pollution on heart problems. 2. It mentions that even moderate air quality, which is considered relatively safe by the EPA, can raise the risk of stroke within hours of exposure. 3.

I heard the fans chant and I thought 'Is that my name?'\\" He joked: \\"I always dreamed of having my own chant but didn't think it would happen so soon.\\" The highly-rated England Under-20 international admits that his rise to prominence has been rapid, significantly aided by his development on loan under Mike Jackson at Shrewsbury over the final seven weeks of last season. Shrewsbury were bound for relegation to League Two, but Iorfa learnt a lot, playing in the then unaccustomed role of right-back, having come through Wolves' system as a central defender. \\"I've been playing centre-back longer,\\" he said. \\"But, when I went on loan to Shrewsbury, it was at right-back and it was a big step for me. You don't realise the tempo of it and playing in front of fans too.

But the manager has shown great faith in me,\\" he added. Since that defeat, Wolves have turned the corner, having not lost in the league since - and only on penalties in the FA Cup third-round replay with Fulham.

When they reach Vienna, Jesse convinces CÃ©line to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her marriage and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked another guy, and this is a chance to realize that he himself is not that different from the rest; in his words, he is \\"the same boring, unmotivated guy.\\" Jesse has to catch a flight early in the morning and does not have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they decide to roam around in Vienna. After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of the city. CÃ©line tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she \\"loved him too much\\". When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in Madrid, but they had broken up when she was avoiding him while he was there. He decided to take a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a Eurail pass and traveled around Europe. When they are walking alongside the Donaukanal (Danube canal) they are approached by a man who, instead of begging, offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice in it. Jesse and CÃ©line decide on the word \\"milkshake\\", and are soon presented with the poem Delusion Angel (written for the film by the poet David Jewell). In a traditional Viennese cafÃ©, Jesse and CÃ©line stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing...

Asphalt The terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In American English, asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen. Geologists often prefer the term bitumen. Common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt/bitumen as \\"tar\\", such as at the La Brea Tar Pits.

In return for promises of support against the British and the French, the Russian Empire took large chunks of territory in the Northeast in 1860. The period of cooperation between the reformers and the European powers ended with the Tientsin Massacre of 1870, which was incited by the murder of French nuns set off by the belligerence of local French diplomats.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more steam is produced happens, how will it affect MORE snow. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to the addition of more steam to the atmosphere. To determine whether this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process of snow formation, let us first analyze the different steps involved in the process: 1. The air is cold - Necessary for ice crystal and snowflake formation. 2. Water is in the air - The presence of moisture or humidity in the air is essential for the snowfall process. 3. The water forms tiny ice crystals - As the temperature is cold, water vapor in the air condenses and forms ice crystals. 4. The ice crystals collide with each other - This is a crucial step in snowflake formation, as individual ice crystals need to come into contact to form larger structures. 5. The ice crystals stick to each other - The bonding between ice crystals creates snowflakes. 6. The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The accumulation of ice crystals causes the snowflakes to increase in size. 7. The ice crystals become too heavy to be in the air - This determines when the snowflakes will fall to the ground. 8. The snowflakes fall to the ground as snow - The culmination of the entire process. Now, let's examine the effect of adding more steam (essentially water vapor) to the atmosphere: When more steam is added to the atmosphere, it leads to an increase in humidity or moisture content in the air. This additional moisture has the potential to affect the snow formation process indirectly by altering some of the steps involved. Higher humidity can increase the number of tiny ice crystals formed in the atmosphere. With more ice crystals available, there is an increased likelihood of these crystals colliding and sticking together, leading to the formation of larger snowflakes. This could increase the overall amount of snowfall. However, several factors need to be considered for this perturbation to have a substantial effect on snow formation: 1. Temperature: If the temperature is not sufficiently cold, the additional steam will not cause an increase in snowfall, as the ice crystals may not form or may melt before reaching the ground. 2. Atmospheric conditions: The presence of other atmospheric conditions, such as winds or air pressure, may also influence the snow formation process and counteract the effects of additional steam. In conclusion, the addition of more steam to the atmosphere can indirectly affect the process of snow formation by increasing the moisture content of the air. This could lead to higher concentrations of ice crystals and consequently more snowfall. However, this effect is dependent on other factors such as temperature and atmospheric conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a breakdown of each option and why \\"natural habitat\\" is the most appropriate answer: - Back yard: While a fox might occasionally be seen in someone's backyard, this is not the primary location where they spend the majority of their time. They may venture into residential areas when searching for food or shelter, but this is not their preferred environment. - Hen house: A fox might attempt to enter a hen house to access a source of food, but it is not where they live or spend most of their time. This option refers to a situation where the fox may cause problems for humans, but it is not an accurate representation of their overall behavior. - Storybook: While foxes appear in many artworks, literature, and mythologies, a storybook is a work of fiction and not a real-life location where a fox would be found. Thus, this option is not relevant to answering the question. - Natural habitat: This option is the most suitable answer because foxes spend most of their time in their natural habitat, which can include a variety of environments such as forests, grasslands, deserts, and even some urban areas. Foxes are highly adaptable animals and can be found in different parts of the world, where they reside primarily in these natural settings. - Bathroom: This option is not relevant to the actual location where a fox would live or spend its time. A bathroom is an indoor space within human constructions, and foxes are not commonly found in such places.

Article: Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Answer: Available choices: 1.

With its help, I have significantly improved my time management skills and productivity. I am rating this app with 4 stars, and here's why: First of all, the app's interface is clean and user-friendly, which makes for a seamless experience. The variety of timers and settings available provide full customization according to my daily schedule. I really appreciate the option to set unique profiles for weekdays and weekends, helping me to distinguish between my work and personal life. Additionally, the notifications feature makes it incredibly easy to stay on track and adhere to my planned activities. They are non-intrusive and blend perfectly into my daily routine. However, there are a few areas in which I believe the app could improve, which is why I couldn't rate it 5 stars. For instance, it would be nice if there was an option to sync data across devices. I often switch between my phone and tablet, and having my settings available on all my devices would be quite helpful.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: From what song, did a Czech rock group take its name? , can you please find it? In a 1991 interview, Zappa reported that he was a registered Democrat but added \\"that might not last long—I'm going to shred that\\". Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a \\"practical conservative\\". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, \\"A system that doesn't allow ownership ... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw.\\" He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.Zappa was an atheist. He recalled his parents being \\"pretty religious\\" and trying to make him go to Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a \\"fascist theocracy\\".In early 1990, Zappa visited Czechoslovakia at the request of President Václav Havel. Havel designated him as Czechoslovakia's \\"Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism\\". Havel was a lifelong fan of Zappa, who had great influence in the avant-garde and underground scene in Central Europe in the 1970s and 1980s (a Czech rock group that was imprisoned in 1976 took its name from Zappa's 1968 song \\"Plastic People\\").

However, they do not convey the exact same meaning. 1. The first sentence is quite clear in its structure and meaning: \\"Düzce is a village in the District of Yüreğir, Adana Province, Turkey.\\" This sentence conveys that Düzce is a village located in the District of Yüreğir, and that the District of Yüreğir is part of Adana Province in Turkey. 2.

How to do squats and lunges Stand erect with your feet approximately one shoulder width apart. From there, you can widen or narrow your stance depending on which muscles you are targeting-a wider stance works the hamstrings and glutes, while a narrower stance works the quads. Point your toes slightly outwards, as this helps to stabilize your stance.","completion":"Now let's move onto the steps of doing squats and lunges. Squats: Step 1: With the comfortable stance as described, stand erect with your feet shoulder-width apart. Having your toes pointed outwards, this seems a stable position to start from. Step 2: Extend your hands out in front of you to keep your balance. You can also bend the elbows or clasp the fingers. Step 3: Lower your body as much as you can by pushing the hips back and bending the knees. You'll feel stretching in your thighs and your hamstrings. Step 4: Pause when your thighs are parallel with the ground, this should look like you're about to sit on a chair. Step 5: Push your body up to the original position, through your heels lifting yourself up back with proper spinal control. Step 6: Make sure you inhale as you lower yourself down and exhale when you push back up. Each round of this is considered as one squat. Justifying steps 1-6: Proper posture and technique in performing squats are crucial, both to achieve the desired results and to avoid injury. It’s also important to control the breath to maintain balance and coordination. Now, for Lunges: Step 1: Maintaining the same starting posture, standing straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, extend one foot forward, while keeping your back foot in its original position. Step 2: Lower your body until the front knee is at 90-degree angle, almost touching the ground. Your back knee should also be dropping towards the ground, but should not touch the ground. Step 3: Pause in this position for a moment, you'll feel the stretch in your front thigh and your back leg’s calf muscle. Step 4: Push back up to the original standing position, moving your feet back to their original position. Make sure to push through your heels to stand back up. Step 5: Repeat the steps with the opposite leg moving forward this time. This makes one complete round of a lunge. Justifying steps 1-5: Lunges are a quad-dominant exercise. They specifically target the largest muscle in your body with the goal to strengthen and tone the legs, and also develop core strength. The breathing technique for lunges is the same as squats; inhale as you drop the knee down, and exhale as you stand back up. Be cautious about keeping your spine neutral during all these movements, avoid hunching or extending your lower back."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steeleye Span are an English folk rock band formed in 1969. Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles \\"Gaudete\\" and \\"All Around My Hat\\". They had four Top 40 albums and achieved a certified gold record with sales of \\"All Around My Hat\\". Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes. With their star now conspicuously ascendant, the band brought in producer Mike Batt (best known for his musical association with the Wombles and, more recently, Katie Melua) to work on their eighth album, All Around My Hat, and their biggest success would come with the release of the title track as a single - it reached number 5 in the UK Charts in late 1975. The single was also released in other European countries and gave them a breakthrough in the Netherlands and Germany. Other well-known tracks on the album included \\"Black Jack Davy\\" (sampled by rappers Goldie Lookin Chain on their track \\"The Maggot\\") and the rocky \\"Hard Times of Old England\\". But while All Around My Hat was the height of the band's commercial success, the good times were not to last long. Despite touring almost every year since 1975, they have not had another hit single, nor any success in the album chart since the late 1970s. The follow-up album Rocket Cottage (1976), also produced by Batt, proved to be a commercial flop, despite having much in common musically with its immediate predecessor. The opening track, \\"London\\", was penned by Rick Kemp as a follow-up to \\"All Around My Hat\\", in response to a request from the record label that Kemp describes as \\"we'll have another one of those, please\\", and released as a single. The song failed to make the UK Chart, in complete contrast to \\"All Around My Hat\\", despite having much in common with its predecessor - a 12/8 time signature, upbeat tempo, solo verses and full harmony chorus. Rocket Cottage also included experimental tracks \\"Fighting for Strangers\\" (with sparse vocals singing concurrently in a variety of keys) and, on the final track, excerpts of studio banter between the band members and a seemingly impromptu rendition of \\"Camptown Races\\", in which Prior gets the lyrics wrong. But while their seventh album, Commoners Crown, was one of their most interesting and varied, including the epic \\"Long Lankin\\", the advent of punk saw the mainstream market turning away from folk rock almost overnight, heralding a downturn in commercial fortunes for the band. However, as a thank you to their committed fans (and also to possibly to garner some publicity for their underperforming album), Steeleye Span showered attendees of a November 1976 concert in London, England, with the then-equivalent of US13,600 in British pound notes. The unannounced idea was Maddy Prior's, and--remarkably--no-one was injured in the rush to grab the falling bills. Indeed, contemporary press reports indicated that it took some time for the crowd to even realise what was happening. Thanks to their connection with Mike Batt, band members appeared in Womble costumes on Top of the Pops, performing the Wombles hit \\"Superwomble\\".

Edwin Lee Wells won a championship in 1932 between the American League (AL) champion team and whom? Answer:","completion":"Edwin Lee \\"Eddie\\" Wells was an American Major League Baseball player, a left-handed pitcher who won the 1932 World Series Championship with the New York Yankees. The Yankees were the American League (AL) champion team during the 1932 season. To answer the question about whom the AL champion, New York Yankees, played against to win the championship in 1932, we need to identify the National League (NL) champion team from that same year. The 1932 World Series saw the New York Yankees face off against the Chicago Cubs. The Chicago Cubs were the NL champions in the 1932 season. The 1932 World Series took place from September 28 to October 1, consisting of four games in total. The New York Yankees, including Eddie Wells, emerged victorious in all four games, achieving a sweeping (4-0) win against the Chicago Cubs. It is also noteworthy that the 1932 World Series was the stage for one of the most iconic moments in baseball history, when Babe Ruth of the Yankees famously called his home run shot, known as the \\"Called Shot,\\" in the fifth inning of Game 3 at Wrigley Field in Chicago. In conclusion, Edwin Lee Wells won the 1932 World Series Championship with the American League champion team, the New York Yankees, against the National League champion team, the Chicago Cubs. The Yankees' four-game sweep in the 1932 World Series solidified their status as one of the dominant teams of that era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: There's no doubt it was chloral? Hypothesis: Are we certain that it was chloral? Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The concept of entailment in logic refers to a fundamental relationship between statements. If a premise entails a hypothesis, it means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this particular context, the premise states \\"There's no doubt it was chloral\\". Essentially, this is expressing a high degree of certainty or total confidence that the substance under discussion was indeed chloral. Float to the hypothesis, \\"Are we certain that it was chloral?\\" This clearly implies a question seeking confirmation or certainty about the identity of the same substance - chloral. So, if we break it down, the certainty expressed in the premise undeniably guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Because the premise leaves no room for doubt about it being chloral, it definitely ensures the truth of the question posed in the hypothesis regarding certainty about it being chloral. In other words, since we are certain in the premise that it was chloral (There's no doubt it was chloral), therefore, the hypothesis that questions that certainty (Are we certain that it was chloral?) can also be valid or true. Hence, the premise does entail the hypothesis. This is based on the logical and syntactical structure of the premise and hypothesis. However, it's important to note that the entailment doesn't depend on real-world certainty or physical validation of the substance being chloral. Entailment, in this context, is purely a relationship between the meanings of the two sentences irrespective of the actual-world truth of the substance's identity."},{"prompt":"A cat is a carnivore which means they don't do what?

I dined here last Friday evening with my family and we all left feeling frustrated and disappointed by our experience. Although I usually have had a fantastic time visiting this establishment, this time, it was a completely different story. The moment we walked in, we noticed that the ambiance had taken quite a nosedive. There were dirty plates piled up on a nearby table and floors desperately in need of sweeping. Even though the decor was still elegant, the untidy appearance overshadowed everything else. What followed was an excruciatingly long waiting time just to be seated, despite having a reservation. We could see that the place was not packed, and several tables remained empty the entire time. The hostess seemed overwhelmed, seemingly unable to efficiently manage the seating. Our bad luck continued when it was time to place our orders. We had to flag down our server multiple times before they could take our order, and it appeared that they were not familiar with the menu items. Explaining dietary restrictions and asking for recommendations was an arduous task that required all our patience. The food, usually the saving grace at any restaurant, just did not measure up this time. My once-favorite dish lacked seasoning and was served lukewarm. My partner's entree was missing a key ingredient, and others at the table experienced similar missteps. It was truly disheartening to see what was once a beloved eatery take such a turn. To top it all off, our dedicated server seemed to have disappeared into thin air. We waited a lengthy amount of time for our check, only to have it delivered by a different server who appeared to be just as confused and overwhelmed. The overall lack of organization and attentiveness ultimately made our dinner experience tedious and tiresome. It is my hope that this review will be taken as constructive criticism because this restaurant used to hold a special place in my heart. In order for me to return, I would need to see significant improvements in cleanliness, service, and food quality. It really was a letdown to see a once-thriving business falter, and I sincerely hope there will be positive changes in the future. Rating: 1.5/5 stars"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited. - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. Maastricht was a key city in order to capture the Belgian Fort Eben - Emael and split the allied armies in half . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million.

This ‘point in time’ relation could also specifically point to the year 1940, when the Battle of Maastricht took place, a direct part of the major expansive conflict known as World War II which lasted from 1939 to 1945. It's important to note that the 'point in time' relation implies a temporal connection between the Battle of Maastricht and World War II. That is, the Battle of Maastricht did not just occur during the period of World War II; it was an integral component of the broader military actions of that global conflict, and represents a significant moment within that specific historical context. The events and outcomes of this battle directly influenced and were influenced by the sequential developments within World War II. This battle was part of Germany's strategic plan to neutralize the significant defenses of the Allies and pave the way for their further advancement into Belgium and other occupied territories. Furthermore, understanding this 'point in time' relation contributes to our understanding of the broader political, military, and social impacts of World War II."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known for his work with the rock band Toto. A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013. The 1989 album Lukather came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years, and the consensus among the band members was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise--counting off on various tracks, for instance--is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album. The single \\"Swear Your Love\\" came from the album. Candyman, recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Pena, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song \\"Red House\\". The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as \\"Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys\\" and sometimes as just \\"Los Lobotomys\\". The song \\"Borrowed Time\\" was released as a single in Europe and included \\"Red House\\" as a B-side. Lukather describes 1997's Luke as a much different and more \\"introspective\\" album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album. Luke is an experimental album, and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, Harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of Luke includes a version of the Jeff Beck song \\"The Pump\\". The song \\"Hate Everything About U\\" was released as a single.","completion":"This text is about Steven Lee Lukather, an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger, and record producer.

Solve this instance: Meryl Streep tells the Hollywood Reporter âwe are on the way to something betterâ in the aftermath of the deluge of sex assault scandals but the actress remains silent about one thing; Her support for child rapist and multiple time sex abuser Roman Polanski. Streep appears on the front cover of this monthâs Hollywood Reporter magazine with Steven Spielberg alongside the words âSpielbergâs post-feminismâ and a blurb about how their new movie is perfectly timed âamid todayâs attacks on womenâ. Does \\" feminist\\" Meryl Streep still support Roman Polanski who raped a 13-year-old girl & now faces 7 new accusations of sexual assault against women & children? pic.twitter.com/BL4LSXLFrt â Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) December 5 2017 Itâs somewhat odd that Streep sees herself as a feminist champion of powerful women in the face of an army of male sexual abusers given that she has vehemently supported and failed to disavow one of the biggest abusers of them all â pedophile Roman Polanski. And what does Meryl Streep have to say about all this? She was part of a Hollywood movement that repeatedly campaigned for Polanskiâs release and for his ability to return to the United States over the past 15 years. Streep along with numerous other members of the Hollywood elite gave Polanksi a standing ovation at the Academy Awards in 2003 after Polanski was awarded an Oscar for The Pianist. Thereâs no plausible deniability here. Unlike with Weinstein Streep canât claim she didnât know Polanski was a child rapist. Everybody knew. Every time she has been asked about Roman Polanski Streep has defended him. She has not disavowed the admitted child rapist and accused serial sex abuser of women and children in the two months since the Hollywood and political sex abuse scandal broke. How can Streep legitimately call herself a âfeministâ and say she is standing up for female victims of sexual assault given this refusal to disavow? Meryl Streep herself referred to Harvey Weinstein as âGodâ during a 2012 speech labeling him âthe punisherâ. Meryl Streep 2017: Weinstein is \\"disgraceful\\".

It suggests that the individual (in this case, \\"you\\") has expressed a desire or has demonstrated a behavior that indicates they are interested in being skilled or helpful in various tasks or situations. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis in question is \\"I know you want to repair everything\\". This statement means that the individual (again, \\"you\\") is believed to have the desire or intent to fix or mend any and all things. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis Now, we will compare the information given in the premise to the information expressed in the hypothesis. The premise states that the individual wants to be \\"handy like\\", while the hypothesis assumes that this \\"handiness\\" translates into wanting to repair everything. This is an extrapolation, and it is important to examine whether or not it is a logical leap. Step 4: Assessing the validity of the hypothesis given the premise While wanting to be \\"handy like\\" may involve fixing or repairing objects, it does not exclusively mean wanting to \\"repair everything\\". Being handy can include a wide range of skills such as fixing objects, assembling furniture, or helping out with various tasks. The premise does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the individual wants to repair everything specifically. Step 5: Conclusion Given the premise \\"Know you want to be handy like\\", it does not logically entail the hypothesis \\"I know you want to repair everything\\". While being handy may encompass repairing things, the premise only suggests a more general interest in being skilled or helpful and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand the whole situation and the reasons behind her decision, let's delve deeper into the story. Susan, an aspiring artist, loved working with different types of materials to create beautiful and unique pieces. One fine day, she decided to try her hand at pottery, a skill she'd always wanted to learn. After attending a few pottery classes and learning the necessary techniques, she started working on her very first project - a beautiful clay pot for her home. While working on her project, Susan was extremely excited and wanted to make the clay pot a conspicuous and impressive piece. She spent hours envisioning the perfect shape, size, and artistic design for her pot. However, as Susan passionately crafted her masterpiece, she lost track of its proportions. Her enthusiasm got the better of her, and she wound up making an enormously large pot, much bigger than initially intended. Upon completing her clay pot, Susan proudly admired her handiwork. She was eager to take it home and find the perfect spot in her house. However, she soon realized that the pot's immense size posed a significant problem. Her home, being a modest one, simply didn't have the space required to accommodate this unexpectedly colossal pot. She attempted to place the pot in various corners of her house, but it always seemed to be in the way, obstructing movement and functionality in the room. Disappointed but not defeated, Susan finally made a difficult decision. She decided that keeping the massive clay pot in her home wasn't a feasible option. Instead, she had to find an alternative solution to ensure that her masterpiece wouldn't go to waste. Eventually, Susan chose to gift the huge clay pot to her friend, who owned a spacious garden. Her friend was thrilled with this unexpected gift and found a beautiful, well-suited spot for it in her garden. It served as an eye-catching, artistic centerpiece, drawing admiration from all who saw it. Even though Susan had to let go of her creation, she didn't feel disheartened. She focused on the positives that came from the experience - she'd learned the valuable skill of pottery and gained the experience necessary to keep proportions in check for her next project. Moreover, Susan's giant clay pot had found a home where it was admired and appreciated, and that brought immense satisfaction to her as an artist. The lesson she learned also inspired her to continue honing her pottery skills and create even more beautiful, well-sized pieces to display proudly in her home."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What collection did the money Gregory put in a safe deposit box come from?, using the article: Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins.

The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are commonly known to implement additional metal and alternative rock elements into their sound, as well as several other genres. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much skepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, \\"They Liked You Better When You Were Dead\\" (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their four studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise. - McFly is an English pop rock band formed in London in 2003. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, ukulele, guitar and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar and vocals), and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Son of Dork were a British pop punk band formed by James Bourne after his previous band, Busted, split in January 2005. The name of the band came from a scene in the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\" where the chant \\"Son of Dork\\" is used. Their debut single, \\"Ticket Outta Loserville\\", was released in November 2005, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Their second single, \\"Eddie's Song\\", reached No. 10 in January 2006. - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - James Elliot Bourne (born 13 September 1983 in Rochford, Essex, England) is an English singer-songwriter and co-founder of pop rock bands Busted and Son of Dork as well as a solo electronic project, Future Boy. From 2013-2015 he was a member of supergroup McBusted, which consisted of himself, Busted bandmate Matt Willis, and McFly. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - \`\` You Said No '' ( also known by its original title , \`\` Crash and Burn '' ) is a song by English pop punk band Busted . It was released on 21 April 2003 as the third single from their debut studio album Busted ( 2002 ) . The song was written by band members James Bourne , Matt Willis and Charlie Simpson , along with Steve Robson and John McLaughlin , and produced by Robson and Graham Stewart . \`\` You Said No '' became Busted 's first song to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart . With previous singles \`\` What I Go to School For '' and \`\` Year 3000 '' having peaked at number three and number two , respectively , Busted also became the first band ever to enter the UK charts 3 - 2 - 1 with their first three singles . - Charles Robert \\"Charlie\\" Simpson (born 7 June 1985) is an English singer, songwriter and musician.

Off late, they've realized that their bosses, Captain Samuel Nolan and Lieutenant Patricia Stone, adopt a rather reserved approach when it comes to solving critical cases. The duo often discuss these tactics, discredited as a result of it affecting their ground process. The detectives receive a new case involving the murder of a prominent city councilman with strong ties to the influential business tycoons. Their superiors instruct them to tread carefully, emphasizing to settle it discreetly. While they begin their investigation, Dave and George sense an unseen force manipulating the narrative, pulling strings from the background. Act 2: During their investigation, Dave and George stumble upon the involvement of a powerful organized crime syndicate. The more they delve into the case, digging out more dubious cooperation between politicians and the business circle, the more their bosses attempt to derail their progress. Captain Nolan and Lieutenant Stone caution the detectives against diving deeper. Undeterred, Dave and George follow the leads, only to realize that their superiors have ties to the same people they are investigating. Confronting their bosses, they demand an explanation, only to be reprimanded and threatened with demotion. The detectives realize there's a massive cover-up happening within their department. Act 3: Disobeying their bosses, Dave and George pursue the case. They realize that the politicians, business magnates, and crime syndicates are conspiring to control the city's resources and exploit the citizens. Their bosses are part of it, ensuring the law enforcement cowers down before these powerful individuals. The detectives struggle to prove this without any support. Eventually, they gather enough evidence and confessions from lower-ranking mobsters. In a thrilling climax, Dave and George present their findings to the District Attorney's office, resulting in their bosses' arrest and dismantling of the syndicate-politician nexus. Epilogue: Captain Nolan and Lieutenant Stone are held accountable, along with several other high-ranking law enforcement officers, politicians, and criminal masterminds. Dave Moss and George Aaronow are commended and promoted for their outstanding work, acting as an example for other officers. The city slowly recovers from the ordeal, restoring faith in its law enforcement institutions. Veiled Intentions explores the intricate world of understanding the influence of the law and criminal underworld intertwining with politics and how it simultaneously affects the citizens. While uncovering the veils of deception, Dave Moss and George Aaronow show resilience and courage, ensuring justice is served, challenging their own personal and professional boundaries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.

While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Answer the following question: Question: how much sulfur dioxide is in propane I found the following answer on Google: Sulfur dioxide (also sulphur dioxide) is the chemical compound with the formula . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found is not correct. The question asks about the presence of sulfur dioxide in propane, and the provided answer only gives the chemical formula for sulfur dioxide without addressing its presence in propane. To better answer the question, let's first understand what propane and sulfur dioxide are and their respective compositions. Propane (C3H8) is a hydrocarbon belonging to the alkane series, and it consists of three carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms. It is mainly used as a fuel for heating, cooking, and powering engines. Propane is a clean-burning fuel, and it is a byproduct of both petroleum refining and natural gas processing. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a chemical compound comprised of one sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms. It is a colorless gas with a pungent odor and is commonly associated with the burning of fossil fuels like coal and crude oil. Sulfur dioxide can be produced during some volcanic eruptions and by industrial processes that involve oxidizing sulfur-containing compounds. Now coming back to the question at hand: The molecular composition of propane does not contain any sulfur atoms, so it does not have any sulfur dioxide in its pure form. Natural gas, which propane is a component of, may contain very small amounts of sulfur-containing impurities like hydrogen sulfide (H2S). However, these impurities are typically very low in concentration and are removed during gas processing to meet safety and environmental requirements. Thus, the purified propane available for consumer use contains negligible to no sulfur dioxide. Therefore, to answer the question, the amount of sulfur dioxide in propane is practically nil or insignificant, as propane does not contain sulfur in its chemical structure and is processed to remove any impurities prior to consumer use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"indirectly impacting a step of the process. An increase in the domestic budget can have a positive effect on improved safety from flooding, though it may not directly impact the specific steps of the process mentioned. The additional funds, if allocated towards flood management and infrastructure projects, can support efforts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the flood management systems in place. Indirect ways in which an increased domestic budget can improve safety from flooding include: 1. Enhancing Dam Infrastructure: Additional funds can be used to improve the design, construction, and maintenance of dams. This could involve reinforcing the dam structure, incorporating advanced technologies to monitor water levels, and implementing an efficient control system to regulate the flow of water through floodgates. 2. Investing in Research and Development: The domestic budget may allocate resources towards research and development to discover and implement innovative solutions for flood management. This can lead to better understanding of flood risks, improved modeling of potential flood scenarios, and the development of more effective flood prevention and mitigation strategies. 3. Flood Forecasting and Early Warning Systems: The increased budget can support the establishment or improvement of flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems contribute to better preparedness and timely response in the event of a potential flooding situation. They help communities and authorities to evacuate or take preventive actions, thus minimizing the impact of flooding events. 4. Capacity Building and Training: Investment in capacity building and training programs for personnel involved in flood management, such as engineers, technicians, and emergency responders, can help enhance the overall efficiency of the flood management process and boost safety standards. 5. Land-use Planning and Floodplain Management: The additional funds can be used to develop and enforce better land-use planning and floodplain management guidelines. This ensures that vulnerable areas are not subjected to inappropriate development, thereby reducing the overall risk of flooding in the region. 6. Flood Mitigation Measures: Increased financial resources can support the implementation of various flood mitigation measures, such as constructing levees, floodwalls, and channel improvements. These measures help reduce the risk and impact of flooding events by redirecting excessive water away from vulnerable areas. In conclusion, while an increase in the domestic budget does not directly impact any step of the process specified, it can indirectly contribute to improved safety from flooding by providing the necessary financial resources to support various flood management initiatives. These initiatives, in turn, can lead to better infrastructure, advanced technologies, and efficient strategies for managing flood risks, ultimately providing enhanced protection against flood damage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. Senator Max Baucus said the U.S. and China must collaborate on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, including projects on energy efficiency, transportation and carbon limits. Close U.S. Senator Max Baucus said the U.S. and China must collaborate on curbing greenhouse... Read More Senator Max Baucus, nominated to become U.S. ambassador to China, told lawmakers he would place top priority on boosting trade while also pressing that nation over computer breaches and crackdowns on dissidents. “The U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world,” Baucus, a Montana Democrat, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today at his confirmation hearing. “It will shape global affairs for generations to come. We must get it right.” Baucus said he’ll take aim at breaches in computer security affecting U.S. companies. He said both nations must collaborate on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, including projects on energy efficiency, transportation and carbon limits. He said he would cooperate with China on threats by North Korea’s nuclear program, and would address China’s Nov. 23 declaration of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, covering areas claimed by Japan and South Korea. That action sparked a rebuke by Secretary of State John Kerry. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said China’s “aggressive behavior” is “part of a pattern of their ambition to dominate that part of the world.” “We are seeing a time of rising tensions in Asia” and the U.S. must keep a close alliance with other countries in the region, McCain said. “I don’t disagree with you,” Baucus responded. No Opposition There was no sign of opposition from Baucus’s fellow senators. “I am sure you will be confirmed,” committee Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, told Baucus as the hearing began in Washington. The chairman scheduled a committee vote on the nomination for Feb. 4. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the foreign relations panel, said Baucus has a strong track record on free trade and urged him to keep “Western values front and center.” “I look forward to seeing you on the ground there,” Corker said. Baucus was nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed Gary Locke as ambassador. He would enter the post at a time of tension and prospects in the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies. His departure also would shake up the leadership of the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is chairman, potentially slowing tax-law revisions and free-trade deals. Retirement Planned Baucus had planned to retire from Congress at the end of this year, his sixth term. In his testimony to the committee, Baucus stressed his free-trade background in Congress, working on deals with Chile, Australia, Panama, Peru and other nations. He said he has traveled extensively to markets for U.S. goods, including Russia, Japan, Spain and Belgium. “I have learned some core lessons along the way,” he said. “Among the most important, I have become a firm believer that a strong geopolitical relationship can be born out of a strong economic relationship, which often begins with trade.” China has been flexing its power in Asia as it asserts claims to disputed territories and resources. It has been involved in tense disputes with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, and expanded national military spending by 10.7 percent to 740.6 billion yuan (122 billion) in 2013. Dissident Crackdown China’s crackdown on dissenters included the jailing this month of legal scholar Xu Zhiyong. Xu, the most prominent activist jailed since Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in 2009 was sentenced by a Beijing court to four years in prison on charges of gathering a crowd to disturb public order. Other issues include cyber-attacks and efforts to gain trade secrets of U.S. firms. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China are running high. Since Obama took office in 2009, the two nations have sparred over trade in goods and services including autos, poultry, clean-energy manufacturing, tires, rare-earth elements and credit-card payments. China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and the U.S. has filed 15 disputes against the Asian nation, more than any other country, according to a report from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office in December. The agency on Jan. 13 said China wasn’t adhering to a WTO ruling involving trade in steel, the first time U.S. officials challenged China’s claim of compliance. Intertwined Economies The nations’ economies are becoming more intertwined, with U.S. trade in goods with China almost quadrupling, to 512 billion, from 2003 through 2013, according to Commerce Department data. The U.S. trade deficit with China declined about 7 percent last year, to 294 billion, after increasing for four years. Baucus’s confirmation would begin a series of changes in Senate committee leadership, which may in turn lead to shifts in policy areas. His departure from the Finance panel would probably elevate Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden to lead the committee, which determines tax, trade and health policy. Wyden, who now leads the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would be replaced by Senator Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat with close ties to the oil and natural gas industries. The shift in leadership would make it tougher, if not impossible, to enact major changes in the U.S. tax code this year. Baucus and his House Republican counterpart, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan, have traveled the U.S. to promote a tax-code overhaul and released discussion drafts on four areas of tax policy. To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Litvan in Washington at llitvan@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net; Jodi Schneider at jschneider50@bloomberg.net ||||| Several tough questions and suggestions from Republicans interrupted a mostly placid confirmation hearing for Sen. Max Baucus to be the next U.S. Ambassador to China. Testifying on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Baucus (D-Mont.) brushed aside questions from Republicans about whether Democrats orchestrated his move to China. Some have suggested President Barack Obama made the appointment so Montana Lt. Gov. John Walsh could be installed in the Senate, giving him a boost ahead of the November election in which he hopes to win Baucus’ seat for a full term. Text Size - + reset Walsh said Monday that an interim appointment could help his prospects for keeping the key Senate seat under Democratic control. When asked whether he ever spoke with Montana’s governor or his former chief of staff, Jim Messina, about who will succeed him in the Senate, Baucus simply responded “no.” Baucus, one of the most senior members of the Senate and chairman of the powerful Finance committee, faced mostly friendly questions from members of both parties. Still, he stumbled into a gaffe, at one point telling Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that he is “no real expert on China.” Johnson asked Baucus what motivated the Chinese to recently form the Air Defense Identification Zone that overlaps disputed territories with Japan, a move widely viewed as further souring relations between the rival Asian powers. “I’m no real expert on China. But it’s my strong belief that Chinese people are just as proud as we Americans are proud,” Baucus said. After the hearing, an aide emphasized that Baucus’s answer was simply an example of his humility as he prepares to move into the new position. “The Senator was being humble, that is the Montana way,” the aide said. After hearing Baucus’s answer to Johnson, McCain said he was “concerned” over the Montana senator’s answers and warned him to be skeptical when dealing with the country’s leadership. “This isn’t a matter of if they’re proud as we are proud,” McCain said. “This is a matter of a rising threat or challenge to peace and security in Asia because of the profound belief in Chinese leadership that China will regain the dominant role” in Asia. “I don’t base my comments to you on John McCain’s opinion. I base it on the opinion of every expert I know of China. And that is … there is a growing threat of another ‘Guns of August,’” McCain added, referring to a book documenting how escalations between bordering countries can provoked World War I. McCain then recommended Baucus consult with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on how to deal with China. Baucus said he intends to do so soon and did not push back against the Arizona senator’s comments. “I don’t disagree with you,” Baucus said. “The whole thing in life is hope for the best and assume for the worst.” Despite the misstep when answering Johnson, Baucus still appears a lock for eventual Senate confirmation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will advance his nomination to the Senate floor possibly as soon as next Tuesday. “I am sure you will be confirmed,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) told Baucus, one of several assurances he gave the six-term senator throughout the hearing. Baucus made clear that while he will work to implement and enforce the policy of President Barack Obama, he will also offer a measure of independence from the administration and avoid “just parroting the talking points.” Those comments confirmed what many in the Senate already know: Despite his likely confirmation into the Obama administration later this year, Baucus will remain his own man in China, a trait that cheered his colleagues. “I don’t think you’re the type of person to take direction from some 25-year old at the White House,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I think you’ve shown independence.” ||||| Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) is set to be confirmed as the nation’s next ambassador to the People’s Republic of China. “For more than two decades, Max Baucus has worked to deepen the relationship between the United States and China,” President Barack Obama said when announcing is nomination. Baucus was, perhaps, being more modest about his qualifications when he told Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) during confirmation hearings recently that he is “no expert” on China. Johnson asked Baucus for his thoughts on why the PRC unilaterally declared an air defense zone recently around a series of Pacific islands under Japanese control. “Senator, I’m no real expert on China,” Baucus replied. “It’s my strong belief that Chinese people are just as proud as we Americans.” Watch the clip below via Senate Foreign Relations Committee: h/t Benny Johnson [Photo via screen grab ] — — > >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com |||||","completion":"A big important man named Senator Max Baucus spoke about the United States and China.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process might be a volcanic eruption. Step by step thinking: - The pressure beneath the Earth's surface has been increasing due to the trapped gases. - These gases have already pushed molten magma towards the surface, and the magma has been cooling. - As the pressure continues to build up over time, it eventually reaches a critical point. - At this critical point, the pressure becomes too high to be contained any longer. Justification: The volcanic eruption serves as a release for the built-up pressure caused by the gases and molten magma. This eruption can result in the expulsion of magma, ash, and other volcanic materials, which can cool and harden into new rock formations on the Earth's surface. This final step is a natural consequence of the increasing pressure beneath the Earth's surface and provides a balance to the geological processes occurring below."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"The movie featuring the song \\"Days in the Sun\\" is \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" released in 2017. This film, directed by Bill Condon, is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1991 animated feature film of the same name. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is based on the French fairy tale \\"La Belle et la Bête,\\" written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and later abridged and modified by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" stars Emma Watson as Belle, a young woman who becomes a prisoner in an enchanted castle ruled by a cursed beast, played by Dan Stevens. The film also features an impressive supporting cast, including Luke Evans as Gaston, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Josh Gad as LeFou, and a talented ensemble providing the voices for the animated objects in the castle, such as Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, and Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is a song from the 2017 adaptation, composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Tim Rice. This new song was created specifically for the live-action film, and it is not present in the original 1991 animated movie. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is a beautiful ballad that highlights the emotions and memories of the characters, offering insights into their lives before the enchantment that transformed the prince into the beast and the castle's staff into household objects. In the song, the characters, led by Mrs. Potts, reminisce about their past lives before the curse, yearning for the joy and warmth they once knew. The song also emphasizes the theme of time passing, as the characters recall their lost humanity and hope for the enchantment to be broken so they can be free to live as they once did. The lyrics poignantly express their longing for the idyllic days they once knew and the importance of love and connection in breaking the spell. The live-action adaptation of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" received a positive reception from critics and audiences alike, praised for its loyalty to the original animated film while also providing new depth to the story and characters with additional songs, new story elements, and visually stunning special effects. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is just one example of how the 2017 film enhanced the narrative, proving that the magic of the original can be reimagined and appreciated in a new light."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP Photo/Michelle Rindels) (Associated Press) Thousands of people gather at the Paris casino in Las Vegas for the Nevada State Democratic Convention on Saturday, May 14, 2016. They are picking delegates to send to the national convention in July.... (Associated Press) LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Nevada Democratic Convention turned into an unruly and unpredictable event, after tension with organizers led to some Bernie Sanders supporters throwing chairs and to security clearing the room, organizers said. Friction between Bernie Sanders' supporters and state Democratic Party leaders had flared throughout the day on Saturday. The convention was scheduled to end by 7 p.m. and when it hadn't wrapped up by 10 p.m., authorities at the Paris Las Vegas casino informed party organizers they could no longer provide the security necessary to handle the crowd. Sanders national communications director Michael Briggs didn't have immediate comment on the events in Nevada when reached by phone on Sunday morning. The hostilities began when Sanders supporters accused state party leaders of putting them at a disadvantage, and they objected to procedural votes to approve the rules of the event on Saturday. They also questioned a credentials committee's disqualification of 58 would-be Sanders delegates. State party officials said the would-be delegates didn't provide acceptable identification and did not meet the May 1 deadline to register as Democrats. State party officials said some Clinton-supporting delegates were ruled ineligible too, although in lower numbers. Clinton has a five-delegate advantage over Sanders in Nevada, 20 to his 15, and is expected to win a majority of the state's eight unpledged superdelegates — party officials who can vote for the candidate they choose. Going into Tuesday's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon, Clinton has 1,716 pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses, compared with 1,433 for Sanders. Some Sanders supporters upset with Saturday's proceedings protested against state party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, outside the Nevada State Democratic Party headquarters on Sunday. Her cellphone number was posted on social media and officials said Lange had received hundreds of phone calls and text messages, including death threats. Sanders tried to tamp down the tensions roiling even before the convention. He issued a statement on Friday, reminding supporters that all Democrats shared the common goals of defeating Donald Trump and electing Democrats to office. \\"Working together respectfully and constructively on Saturday at the Nevada Democratic convention will move us closer to those essential goals,\\" he said. ||||| The Nevada State Democratic Party ended its state convention late Saturday amid security concerns about unruliness, the state party said Sunday. The state convention heated up Saturday night as supporters of presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., became upset over procedural issues and the delegate seating process. The convention’s main purpose was to pick delegates who will go in July to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. In the state’s Feb. 20 Democratic presidential caucuses, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat Sanders. Saturday’s event ended at 10 p.m. at Paris Las Vegas, three hours after its scheduled end time, after the hotel-casino’s security director told party and campaign officials that “the property could no longer provide the necessary security under conditions made unruly and unpredictable,” the Nevada State Democratic Party said, adding that the hotel-casino had requested a “prompt conclusion.” Unrest continued after the convention. A protest unfolded Sunday outside the Nevada State Democratic Party’s headquarters, at 6233 Dean Martin Drive in Las Vegas, where, the state party said in a statement, Sanders backers defaced the building’s exterior walls. A report was filed with the Metropolitan Police Department. Some of the graffiti was aimed at state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange, who presided over Saturday’s convention. “Fire Roberta,” said one message scrawled in sidewalk chalk on the wall next to the party’s door. Another message said: “#FREETHE64,” a reference to a dispute over 64 Sanders supporters who didn’t qualify to be delegates at the convention. The party called the issue a “false controversy” created by Sanders national staff members who were at the convention to incite an uproar. Party officials have said those people didn’t meet the criteria for various reasons, including not registering as Democrats by a deadline, or having incomplete or wrong information on file and not responding to prior requests to correct it. Eight potential delegates for Clinton also were turned away. Separately, the state party said Lange’s cellphone number was posted on social media, and she received thousands of text messages, phone calls and emails, including death threats. The Sanders campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment Sunday. Saturday’s event ended with Lange accepting a motion to appoint delegates preapproved by the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, organizers said. She also accepted a motion to elect the state central committee according to rules submitted by county party chairs. A security guard went with Lange off the stage and stayed with her because of the rising unruliness. At one point, police officers stood at the front of the stage, and lights were dimmed to encourage protesting convention attendees to leave, according to attendees and YouTube video posted on social media. Sanders supporters had conflicts with party leaders before the convention, too. They had sued the state party and lost in court Friday after alleging that deadlines were improperly changed to prevent some from running for party leadership posts. “We were just trying to force the democratic process,” said Angie Morelli, an attendee elected to be a national delegate representing Sanders. “This party is supposed to be the party of unity and inclusion.” Morelli criticized how the event was handled. “That’s not how you unite a party. … They didn’t care about giving us any voice whatsoever.” Before the convention, Democratic leaders including Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., had issued calls encouraging all to work together respectfully at the convention. The Nevada State Democratic Party will send 43 delegates to the national convention. Clinton received seven of the 12 national delegate slots up for grabs at the state convention after narrowly turning out more supporters than the Sanders camp. Out of nearly 3,400 qualified state-level delegates who showed up, Clinton had 33 more than Sanders. Clinton had 1,695 delegates seated at the state convention. Sanders had 1,662. Clinton went into the state convention with a delegate lead in Nevada after winning the Feb. 20 caucuses, but Sanders supporters outnumbered Clinton’s backers at the April county conventions, where results are not tied to any national delegates. After the convention, Clinton has a 20-15 delegate advantage over Sanders. She is also expected to win a majority of Nevada’s eight unpledged superdelegates.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com/AP) — A Los Angeles judge has ordered the release of a man who spent more than three decades in prison for murder after prosecutors conceded he did not get a fair trial. The district attorney’s office said during a hearing Wednesday in Superior Court that there were errors in the case against 62-year-old Andrew Wilson. Judge Laura Priver granted a motion to dismiss the case. Wilson quietly said “Thank you” to the judge, who replied, “You are welcome Mr. Wilson.” Outside the courthouse, Wilson’s attorney’s were jubilant. “I’m so happy!” Paula Mitchell with the Loyola Law School Innocence Project said. “I believe strongly in Mr. Wilson’s innocence and I know we’re going to help him get the rest of the way with the innocence finding. He did not do this crime and I’ll do everything I can to help the LAPD find who did it.” He has maintained his innocence since his arrest in 1984 for the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Christopher Hanson in Los Angeles. A bailiff released Wilson immediately from handcuffs, but he’s not expected to be processed out of custody until later Wednesday or Thursday. Another hearing will be held to determine whether he is factually innocent. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office has said it will not re-try Wilson. Wilson says he plans to return to St. Louis to spend time with his mother, Margie Davis, who will turn 97 on May 1. (© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Earlier this week a judge allowed a woman to give evidence in court wearing a burqa for the first time.","completion":"Title: Schools and the Niqab: A Discussion on Women's Visibility Hello kids! Today, we are going to talk about a lady named Dr. Sarah Wollaston. She works in a place called Totnes, Devon, and she has something to say about schools and a special piece of clothing called the niqab. Now, you might be wondering, what is a niqab? A niqab is a type of clothing worn by some women, which covers their face, except for their eyes. It is a part of their culture and religion. Dr. Sarah Wollaston is worried that some schools might not be treating women fairly if they allow them to wear the niqab. She thinks that when women wear this special clothing, they become \\"invisible.\\" That means that people might not notice them or think they are important. Recently, a school called Birmingham Metropolitan College decided not to ban the niqab. That means students can wear the niqab if they want to. This decision came after students expressed that wearing the niqab is important to them. Oh, and guess what happened earlier this week? A judge allowed a woman to wear a burqa in court. A burqa is like a niqab, but it covers the whole body and face, with just a small opening for the eyes. This is a big deal because it's the first time a woman has been allowed to wear a burqa in court. It shows that people are trying to understand and respect different cultures and clothing choices. So, that's the story about Dr. Sarah Wollaston and her thoughts on schools and the niqab.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

To find the value of b, we need to isolate b on one side of the equation by performing the inverse operation. Since b is currently being multiplied by 6, we perform the inverse operation by dividing both sides of the equation by 6. (6*b) / 6 = -6 / 6 By performing this operation, we are left with: b = -1 The variable b has now been isolated, and the solution to the equation 6*b = 7 - 13 is b = -1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, we need to subtract 192 from -2: -2 - 192 = -194. So now our equation becomes -194 = -97 * v. To solve for v, we need to get rid of the -97 that is being multiplied to v. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -97: -194 / -97 = v. Now, let's complete the division: 194 divided by 97 is equal to 2 (remember we've divided a negative number by a negative number, that's why the result is positive). So, v = 2.

Write a title: The Palestinian Fatah Movement threatened to boycott the upcoming presidential elections unless the cause of Yasser Arafat #39;s is revealed.","completion":"Title: Palestinian Fatah Movement Demands Revelation of Yasser Arafat's Cause of Death as a Condition for Participation in the Upcoming Presidential Elections The ongoing political tensions within the Palestinian territories have taken a new turn, as the Palestinian Fatah Movement has recently issued an ultimatum, demanding that the truth surrounding the cause of Yasser Arafat's mysterious death be revealed before they agree to participate in the forthcoming presidential elections. The Palestinian Fatah Movement, a historic political and military faction that played a vital role in the Palestinian struggle for independence and nationhood, has expressed its strong reservations and skepticism regarding the incomplete knowledge of the late leader’s demise as a significant obstacle to their engagement in the upcoming political process. Yasser Arafat, the iconic figurehead of the Palestinian resistance and the founding father of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), died suddenly on November 11, 2004, while being treated in French military hospital Le Val-de-Grâce. Arafat's unexpected passing has been a subject of speculation and controversy ever since, with many theories suggesting that he may have been poisoned, thereby making his death an act of assassination. Despite numerous investigations, however, the precise cause of Arafat's death has not been conclusively determined, much to the frustration of Palestinians and the international community. The Palestinian Fatah Movement's decision to withhold its participation in the forthcoming Palestinian Authority (PA) presidential elections unless the truth behind Arafat's death is uncovered, can be seen as a reflection of the movement's commitment to safeguarding the historical legacy and political legitimacy of its founding leader. The organization aims to hold those responsible for the alleged assassination accountable and to ensure that justice is served for its revered leader and the entire Palestinian nation, who continue to struggle under the ongoing Israeli occupation and political fragmentation. This demand by the Fatah movement may also be viewed in the context of internal Palestinian politics. With leaders inside the Fatah movement feeling marginalized or discontented with the recent political developments, revealing the cause of Arafat's death could provide new opportunities for regaining influence within the Palestinian political arena. Moreover, it may provide a rallying point for the various Palestinian factions to foster a sense of unity and shared objectives in the protracted quest for self-determination and statehood. The repercussions of Fatah's potential election boycott could be dramatic, as the movement remains a significant political force in Palestinian politics and society. Its absence from the electoral process might lead to a decreased voter turnout, tarnish the overall credibility of the election results, or exacerbate the fragile political climate in the Palestinian territories due to the delicate balance of power among various factions. Given the profound consequences of Fatah's ultimatum, it is in the best interest of both the Palestinian territories and the international community to address this long-standing issue. Doing so would not only honor Arafat’s memory but also pave the way for the inclusion of all Palestinians in a fair and transparent political process, ultimately contributing to lasting peace, stability, and prosperity in the region."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Lee received every threat that was sent to him from his stalker.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a drought in progress happens, how will it affect LESS snow. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a drought in progress can have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. A drought is characterized by a prolonged period of below-average precipitation, which can result in a reduced availability of water on the ground. This can affect the process of snow formation in the following ways: 1. Direct effect: Since water availability is lower during a drought, there will be less water evaporating from the ground and rising into the atmosphere. This will lead to a reduced amount of water vapor available to form clouds, making it less likely for the cloud formation process to reach the stage where water droplets become ice crystals and eventually snowflakes. 2. Indirect effect: Droughts can also lead to higher temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Warmer air is capable of holding more water vapor, making it harder for the water droplets in clouds to cool and condense into ice crystals. This can further reduce the possibility of snowflake formation. In summary, a drought in progress can directly and indirectly affect the process of snow formation by reducing the availability of water vapor in the atmosphere, as well as changing the temperature and circulation patterns, making it less likely for snowflakes to form.

Answer based on context: Coming off their home win over the Vikings, the Bears flew to Sun Life Stadium for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night. Chicago delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould. The Bears added onto their lead in the second quarter with Gould's 24-yard field goal. Chicago went back to work in the third quarter as Gould booted a 50-yard field goal, followed by a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Matt Fort&#233;. As they had done all game, the Bears defense continued to stifle any offensive production by the Dolphins, thus completing the shutout, the first shutout recorded by the Bears since 2006. As of 2016, this remains the final shutout by the team. With the win, not only did the Bears improve to 7-3, but they also won their 700th game in franchise history (the first NFL team to do so).

And the answer is?","completion":"The Bichon Frise is a small breed of dog, known for its friendly, affectionate, and sociable temperament. They have a distinct appearance, characterized by their white, curly, and soft coat, which typically consists of hypoallergenic hair as opposed to fur. This makes them an excellent choice for individuals with allergies or sensitivities to pet dander. The Bichon Frise belongs to the non-sporting or companion dog group, and they originated from the Mediterranean region. Their ancestry can be traced back to the Barbet, a water dog, and the Standard Poodle. From these breeds, Bichons inherited their signature fluffy, curly hair and endearing personalities. The name \\"Bichon Frise\\" is comprised of two parts: \\"Bichon\\" which is a term that signifies a group of small dog breeds, and \\"Frise,\\" which is derived from the French word \\"frisé\\" meaning curly or fluffy. The Bichon Frise is closely related to other breeds in the Bichon family, which includes the Bichon Bolognese, the Bichon Havanese, the Bichon Maltese, and the Bichon Tenerife. These breeds were popular among European nobility during the Renaissance era, where they were often kept as cherished pets, lap dogs, and companions. Bichon Frises are typically small dogs, with adult males and females averaging around 9.5 to 11.5 inches in height at the withers and weighing between 12 to 18 pounds. They possess a level of intelligence that makes them quite trainable, and they enjoy participating in various dog sports, such as obedience, agility, and rally. These dogs also have a friendly and outgoing nature, allowing them to get along well with other pets, including dogs and cats, and they tend to thrive in households with children. Bichons are known for their playful, energetic demeanor, and they require regular exercise and mental stimulation to keep them healthy and content. The Bichon Frise's coat requires a fair amount of grooming to maintain its soft, fluffy appearance. Frequent brushing is necessary to prevent matting and tangling, and regular trims or professional grooming every few months will also help to ensure that their coat stays clean and healthy. In summary, the Bichon Frise is a small, friendly, and affectionate dog breed that is known for its white, curly coat and sociable temperament. They are intelligent, trainable, and make excellent companions for families with children and other pets. Their hypoallergenic hair is a bonus for those with allergies or sensitivities to pet dander, making them a popular and lovable choice for many households."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Carla Hughes met the victim's fiance at the middle school where she was a teacher. The same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of two counts of murder Tuesday for the death of Avis Banks spared her life, declining to impose the death penalty.

Carla was found guilty and the people in charge said she will have to stay in prison for her entire life. They did not give her the strictest punishment, but she will not be able to leave the prison. This happened in a place called Mississippi, where hurting a pregnant woman is considered a very, very bad thing.

Sentence 1: Can Gerth really be serious? Sentence 2: There's no way that Gerth is serious. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The first sentence, \\"Can Gerth really be serious?\\", is a question that seeks a response on the probability or likelihood of Gerth being serious. The sentence does not explicitly state whether Gerth is serious or not, but it is merely looking for confirmation or clarification. The second sentence, \\"There's no way that Gerth is serious,\\" makes a definitive assumption about Gerth's seriousness. This statement suggests that the speaker believes it impossible for Gerth to be serious. To determine if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true, there needs to be a distinction between the sentences. However, as the first sentence is a question and not an assertion, it technically cannot be true or false. Since it is impossible to evaluate the second sentence's truth based on the first sentence's truth, we cannot conclude if the second sentence is true or not based on the information given. Suppose we reframe the first sentence as an assertion like, \\"Gerth is really serious.\\" In that case, there exists an intentional contradiction between the two sentences, as the first sentence suggests that Gerth is indeed serious, while the second sentence states that it's impossible for Gerth to be serious. If we assume the revised first sentence is true, then the second sentence would naturally be false, as the statements are mutually exclusive.

However, the hypothesis presented here, \\"You can't drive along the Sunset Strip anymore but you can walk it,\\" implies a recent change has occurred in the manner in which people can experience this iconic location. It is suggested that driving is no longer possible, but walking is now the primary means to experience the Sunset Strip's unique atmosphere.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? that movie makes me want to watch the whole thing again Options: [I] negative; [II] positive;","completion":"[II] positive The sentiment of the tweet is positive because the person is saying that they liked the movie so much that they want to watch it again. If they did not like it, they would not want to see it again. The negative option is not correct because there are no words or phrases in the tweet that show the person did not like the movie."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Process: - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less receptors take over and reproduce happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have an indirect effect on the process. If there are fewer receptors taking over and reproducing, it will likely result in a slower rate of viral replication. This would, in turn, lead to a reduced number of newly produced virus particles and thus, a slower rate of cell damage. While fewer cells would be impacted overall, the infection would still spread, albeit at a slower pace. Therefore, the perturbation would indirectly affect the rate and extent of cell damage in the host organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The professor gave Nick but not Logan an A because Choose from: + Nick showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements.. + Logan showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements..","completion":"The professor gave Nick but not Logan an A because Logan showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements. This became evident during the course of the semester while they were both enrolled in the advanced chemistry class. The professor had high expectations from all the students, and aimed to ensure that everyone gained a deep understanding of the subject. At the beginning of the semester, both Nick and Logan showed enthusiasm and keen interest in learning about the periodic table of elements. They participated in class discussions, submitted assignments on time, and asked relevant questions. However, as the semester progressed, a clear distinction emerged in the performance of the two students. On one hand, Nick consistently demonstrated a strong grasp of the periodic table and its underlying concepts. He could accurately identify the atomic number, mass, and electron configurations of various elements. In addition, Nick could also describe the various trends observed across periods and groups, such as atomic radius and ionization energy, and make insightful connections that underpinned the intrinsic properties of the elements. Nick's exceptional proficiency in this area was not just limited to rote memorization, but a profound understanding of how the periodic table was organized and how the elements interacted with one another. This was particularly evident in his impressive performance in the laboratory, where he accurately predicted the outcomes of various chemical reactions based on his knowledge of the periodic table. In stark contrast, Logan struggled to demonstrate adequate knowledge of the periodic table of elements. Despite his initial interest and dedication, he consistently failed to recall basic information about the elements, such as their symbols and placement on the periodic table. Additionally, he struggled to understand and apply the general trends and patterns observed across groups and periods. Moreover, his lack of understanding made it difficult for him to make connections among the elements, which affected his ability to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions and problem-solving tasks. During lab exercises, Logan often relied on his classmates and written resources to guide him, as his limited knowledge of the periodic table hampered his capability to conduct experiments independently and effectively. As the semester concluded, the professor had no choice but to take into account the evident discrepancies in the performance of the two students. While Nick displayed a comprehensive understanding and impressive mastery of the periodic table of elements, Logan's persistent struggle to grasp its fundamental concepts and principles led to his subpar performance. Consequently, the professor felt it was only fair to award Nick an A for his achievements, while Logan was not given the same grade due to his inadequate grasp of the periodic table of elements. In conclusion, despite their initial enthusiasm and commitment, the different levels of understanding and application of the periodic table of elements led to divergent outcomes for Nick and Logan. While Nick's extensive knowledge and practical application of the concepts earned him an A, Logan's poor knowledge of the periodic table left him trailing behind, ultimately resulting in a lower grade. The professor's decision underscored the importance of a profound knowledge of the periodic table of elements, which is the foundation of chemistry."},{"prompt":"You are given a new situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. and a hint : The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. Please answer this question : Which river had a food source mostly derived from algae?","completion":"The river with a food source mostly derived from algae would likely be the Mures river, as it is slow-moving and deep. Wider streams and those that lack a canopy, such as the lowland Mures river, derive the majority of their food base from algae, while upland rivers like the fast-moving Olt would have a food base mostly derived from the trees within the riparian forests."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Tom Ford was born on August 27, 1961, in Austin, Texas, the son of realtors Shirley Burton (nee Shirley Ann Thrasher) and Thomas David Ford. He spent his early life in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, and in San Marcos, outside Austin; his family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, when he was 11. In Santa Fe, he entered St. Michael's High School and later moved to Santa Fe Preparatory School, from which he graduated in 1979. When interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended The New School's Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture, and that his work at Chloe was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: \\"I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, 'Armani and Chanel.' Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, 'Because you were wearing something Armani'. Is it any wonder he got the job?\\" Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years. In 1988, Ford moved to Perry Ellis, where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company's president, and Marc Jacobs, its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion. In a later interview with The New York Times, he commented, \\"If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It's looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style.\\" At the time, Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women's ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company's creative director, Dawn Mello said, \\"no one would dream of wearing Gucci\\". In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand's chief women's ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to Milan. \\"I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn't want the job,\\" Mello said. \\"For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky.\\" Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September. Ford's role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing menswear within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position, heading the brand's ready-to-wear, fragrances, image, advertising, and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company's chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, \\"Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black.\\" Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, Domenico De Sole insisted that he remain. Nonetheless, Ford's work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company's public face.

The word scourge - 'a cause of suffering' - is metaphorically derived from what instrument of punishment?","completion":"The word \\"scourge\\" as a metaphor for 'a cause of suffering' is derived from an ancient instrument of punishment called a scourge or a whip. A scourge is a type of whip that consists of multiple lashes or tails that are often knotted and attached to a single handle. It was used predominantly as a tool for inflicting physical punishment, pain, and suffering on people, and occasionally animals, in various societies throughout history. The scourge's reputation as a brutal and agonizing instrument of punishment can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Romans and Egyptians. The Roman flagrum, for example, was a particularly vicious version that featured several lashes with metal or bone enhancements, such as balls, hooks, or sharp points. Whipping with a scourge like this was so terrifying that it was often enough to scare people into obedience. This Roman practice of scourging was later adopted in the Medieval Europe, where it became not only a method of punishment for criminals but also a means of self-inflicted penance for religious purposes. The members of various monastic orders, such as the flagellants, would scourge themselves to display humility, atone for sins, or seek divine intervention in times of crisis. The term ‘scourge’ eventually evolved not just to represent the physical instrument itself but also to symbolize anything that caused widespread suffering, affliction, or devastation. When used metaphorically, a scourge can refer to various abstract concepts or entities, such as diseases, natural disasters, oppressive regimes, or any other force that brings about widespread misery and hardship. For instance, the rapid spread of the bubonic plague during the 14th century, which led to the death of an estimated 75-200 million people across Europe and Asia, was often referred to as the \\"Great Scourge.\\" Another example is the use of the term \\"scourge of war\\" to describe the widespread human suffering and devastation caused by military conflicts. In conclusion, the word \\"scourge\\" as a metaphor for 'a cause of suffering' is derived from the instrument of punishment called a scourge or whip. The whip's reputation as a brutal and agonizing tool for inflicting pain and suffering on people throughout history has allowed the term to become synonymous with any force or entity that causes widespread affliction and misery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[UPDATE: See One more time: The Beatles on iTunes? and Behind the Beatles-iTunes deal.] Among the threads that seem to be coming together this week: The 500,000-square-foot data center in Maiden, N.C. -- nearly five times the size of Apple's giant data center in Newark, Calif. -- which COO Tim Cook has said is on track to open this year and could very well be ready to go this week. Apple's purchase last December of Lala's streaming music service, which it shuttered five months later, presumably to replace it with a streaming version of iTunes. The high-quality live web-streams of Steve Jobs' last two performances, suggesting that Apple may have developed the capability of streaming video as well as audio. The latest version of iCal, which replaces locally stored data with calendars stored on Apple's servers. The launch of the new MacBook Airs, which Jobs described as the shape of notebook computers to come. Their relatively small storage capacity (starting at 64 GB) suggests that in the future, Apple may expect users to store their files in the cloud, rather than on their hard drives. The latest iteration of Apple TV, which replaces hard-drive storage with streaming video. In a note to clients issued Monday morning, Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster had this to say about the \\"online iTunes-related event\\" scheduled for 10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST): \\"We believe Apple could announce a cloud-based iTunes service for content streaming to connected devices. Apple is developing a data center in Maiden, NC that we believe could serve as the hub for such a service. The company has indicated that the data center is on track to be completed by the end of CY10 and it will begin using it then. With Apple's growing family of connected devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, and Macs) it only makes sense that Apple would deliver a cloud-based media service to leverage its competitive advantage in the space: devices. As part of this, the new Apple TV with limited storage, a lower price, and a focus on accessing content over the internet would fit in nicely. We see this device, and the potential iTunes cloud-based service, as a stepping stone for an all-in-one, connected Apple television.\\" See also: [Follow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter @philiped] ||||| Apple has posted a cryptic message on its Web site, teasing the world about an “exciting” iTunes announcement that’s coming tomorrow. What could it be? I saw that someone had suggested The Beatles were finally coming to iTunes, but really, who cares? If you want The Beatles on your iPhone you can grab the newly remastered albums that came out last year, “rip, mix, burn,” then off you go. Not very exciting, no. What could be exciting, though, is a streaming music service. In an instant, Apple would have killed the MP3 once and for all. You hear that? That’s the sound of the RIAA thanking Apple over and over again. A streaming music service would make all kinds of sense for Apple, and it wouldn’t be too bad for us consumers either. Streaming services have already seen much success, chiefly with Spotify in Europe and Rdio here in the U.S. But an iTunes Streaming service, probably given a slick name like “iTunes Stream,” would instantly take the idea of streaming from something only techie geeks care about to something the whole family can enjoy. Think about it. Every song ever (deals with record labels permitting, of course), right there on your iPhone, your iPad, your Apple TV, your MacBook, on-demand and always at the ready. If you can access the Internet (“the Cloud”), then you can listen to your tunes. And just like that, your MP3s are worthless. Why would you maintain a giant collection of hard drive-eating MP3 and AAC (the file format iTunes uses) files when you can access the same songs from a handy App? Let’s see… gigabytes upon gigabytes of music files versus a single App that can stream any song with the touch of a button. Well, the touch of a screen, as it were. It’s a no-brainer, and everybody wins. Apple collects 10 per month (or whatever) from you, you get access to an entire Cloud’s worth of music, and the record labels no longer have to worry about pesky kids “trading files” any more. Not because illegally trading iTunes-purchased music was ever a problem for the record labels, but that iTunes Stream would represent a very clear change in the culture of music consumption. Kids wanting to listen to Kanye West’s “Monster” won’t think to look for an “MP3,” they’ll grow up learning to fire up iTunes Stream on their iPhone. I can see audiophiles not particularly caring about any of this, complaining about the compression used in the streaming, never thinking to listen to music on a phone, but the number of people who listen to 24bit lossless vinyl rips (give me FLAC or give me death!) using Foobar2000 and 500 headphones is non-existent compared to people who are cool with listening to Nicki Minaj on YouTube (read: rubbish quality) using 10 earbuds. And now we play the waiting game, waiting for Apple to kill the MP3 once and for all. Hopefully. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Apple has teased a major iTunes-related announcement on its homepage, which has led to speculation that it may be related to a cloud-based music streaming service. The announcement could also be tied to the completion of Apple's massive data center in North Carolina, which is set to go online. A streaming music service would eliminate the need for users to maintain large collections of MP3 and AAC files on their devices, allowing them to access any song instantly via the internet. This would benefit Apple, consumers, and record labels, potentially signaling a shift in the culture of music consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. While visiting a friend, Ash got caught stealing one of their favorite toys. Given the context: What will Ash want to do next? Answer:","completion":"In the situation where Ash has been caught stealing one of their friend's favorite toys, Ash is likely experiencing a range of emotions, including guilt, embarrassment, and fear of losing the friendship. Here are some possible steps that Ash might want to take next in order to make amends and preserve the relationship: 1. Apologize sincerely: The first and foremost thing Ash should do is to genuinely apologize to their friend. They may want to express their regret for their actions, explain that they understand the impact and hurt caused, and assure their friend that it won't happen again. 2. Return the stolen item: Ash should immediately return the stolen toy to their friend. This is a necessary step to mend the situation and demonstrate their commitment to making things right. 3. Understand their friend's feelings: It is important for Ash to empathize with their friend and validate their emotions. Ash could ask their friend how they are feeling and genuinely listen to their response, acknowledging the hurt and violation of trust they have caused. 4. Make amends: In order to rebuild trust, Ash may want to do something to make up for the theft. This could be a kind gesture such as buying their friend a new toy, helping out with a chore, or spending time together doing an activity their friend enjoys. 5. Reflect on their own behavior: Ash should take some time to think about what led them to steal their friend's toy in the first place. They might want to consider the reasons behind their actions, and possibly work on addressing any personal issues that contributed to this behavior in order to prevent it from happening again in the future. 6. Seek forgiveness: After acknowledging their mistake and making amends, Ash can ask their friend for forgiveness. It is crucial that Ash demonstrates genuine remorse and is willing to make the necessary changes in their behavior to regain their friend's trust. 7. Rebuild trust: Trust is an essential component of any friendship. Ash must accept that it might take time to rebuild trust with their friend. Showing consistency, honesty, and reliability in their actions moving forward will be crucial in reestablishing a strong foundation for the friendship. 8. Learn from the experience: Lastly, Ash should take this incident as an opportunity to grow and learn. They can use this experience to become more aware of their actions, exercise self-control, and develop respect for other people's belongings. Learning from their mistakes is the best way to ensure that Ash does not repeat this behavior in the future. In conclusion, Ash's next steps should involve apologizing sincerely, returning the stolen toy, empathizing with their friend's feelings, making amends, reflecting on their own behavior, seeking forgiveness, rebuilding trust, and learning from their mistakes. By following these steps, Ash has the best chance of restoring their friendship and demonstrating that they are truly remorseful for their actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on. But when I look at that worn oak (outdated) table, that needs refinishing in the worst way - I am grateful for the evenings there, where my kiddos learned to be a family. Don’t be misled, we are not the Cleavers. We have “Fun Friday” where Mom does not get to badger them about their table manners (ugh - they revel in this), Sometimes we eat in the living room while we watch a movie, sometimes we eat in shifts because of our schedules.

They take his numbers seriously ... but they think, as [Jeb] said, that his support is all about anger, angst and theatrics.

We have this puzzle: 47 * u - 206 * u = 130 * u + 289 Let's first simplify the left side by finding the oranges (u): (47 - 206) * u = -159 * u Now our puzzle looks like: -159 * u = 130 * u + 289 Let's bring all the oranges (u) to one side of the puzzle. To do that, we add 159 * u to both sides: -159 * u + 159 * u = 130 * u + 289 + 159 * u Which simplifies to: 0 = 289 * u + 289 Now let's get rid of that 289 on the right side. We will do this by subtracting 289 from both sides: 0 - 289 = 289 * u -289 = 289 * u Now to find the value of the orange (u), we need to divide both sides by 289 so that u is all by itself: u = -289 / 289 And we get: u = -1 So the answer is -1.

Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards.

The uncertainty arose from the fact that the newly-established separate countries of Serbia and Montenegro were now required to define their own unique regulations and policies regarding citizenship, residency, and other related matters. Consequently, individuals who identified themselves as Montenegrin citizens but were living in Serbia may have had to deal with potential challenges related to obtaining necessary documentation, adjusting their legal status, accessing social services, or exercising their rights in their new host country.

Answer the following question: which country in the uk has the highest population?","completion":"England is the country in the United Kingdom that has the highest population. The United Kingdom is composed of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Among these countries, England is the largest in terms of both land area and population. Located in the southern part of Great Britain, England holds approximately 84% of the total population of the United Kingdom. According to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the population of England is estimated to be around 56.29 million people as of mid-2020. This is a significant proportion of the UK's total population, which stands at around 67.1 million. The large population in England can be attributed to a combination of factors, including its historically large land area, fertile agricultural lands, and the influence of major historic events like the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution, in particular, led to rapid urbanization and the growth of major cities such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham. Today, London serves as the capital city of both England and the United Kingdom and has become one of the most culturally diverse and populous cities in the world, with an estimated population of over 9 million people. In contrast to England, the other countries of the United Kingdom have significantly smaller populations. According to the ONS, as of mid-2020, Scotland has an estimated population of around 5.47 million, Wales has approximately 3.17 million, and Northern Ireland has around 1.89 million residents. It is worth noting that population distribution within England is quite uneven, with the major cities and surrounding regions being especially densely populated, while rural areas, especially in the north, tend to have lower population densities. Despite this, England continues to be the most populous country in the United Kingdom by a significant margin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Title: Chemistry Made Easy Review: I purchased this book to help with homework and I have found it to be very helpful. The book covers the basics of a high school chemistry course but unlike most textbooks or internet resources, it tries to break down and simplify chemistry to make it more manageable. For example, I was having a difficult time explaining Lewis Dot structures or even finding a good resource for understanding it on the web. The author did a very good job of simplifying the approach whereby the generation of these structures made sense. The periodic table that is included in the book is detachable and also helpful. I would have liked a few more problems and some additional pictures may have been helpful but it was an excellent resource especially when combined with a number of the fine websites and interactive periodic tables on the web. It certainly made my life easier helping with homework and recommend it. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a positive sentiment. The reviewer highlights several aspects of the \\"Chemistry Made Easy\\" book that they found helpful, such as its simplified approach to complex concepts like Lewis Dot structures, the detachable periodic table, and its usefulness as a complementary resource with other online materials.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is 19, engaged to be married in the fall, and aspires to someday run his own ranch, following in the footsteps of his parents, who died in a car crash and left young Ennis and his brother and sister alone to fend for themselves.

The bitter cold leads to their sleeping spooned, Jack initiates touching, and Ennis eventually responds. Over the next several days, the two increasingly give in to their attraction to one another.When the summer ends, the two men separate and continue with their lives. Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams), who soon gets pregnant and gives birth to two daughters, Alma Jr. and Jenny. Jack, by contrast, is still drawn to other men, and remains unmarried until he meets and, after a drunken one-night stand, has a son with feisty cowgirl Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway), whose father owns a profitable business selling farming machinery in Texas and openly looks down on Jack. Searching for acceptance, approval, and unconditional love, Jack writes to Ennis in 1967, when they arrange to meet again.When Jack arrives in Wyoming, both men passionately kiss.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: CHAPTER SUMMARY 36.1 Sensory Processes A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction) by a sensory receptor. Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation. Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor’s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense.

The massive tragedy claimed six lives as a Dodge Durango SUV plunged into a rain-swollen creek, and the surviving mom and dad now face the agonizing reality of losing five of their children. Adding to the devastating event, the father, who was behind the wheel, is currently hospitalized. The accident took place shortly after midnight on County Rd. 107. The area had seen significant rainfall, leading to the creek swelling beyond its usual confines. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is mourning the untimely loss of nine of its members as they desperately try to come to terms with the scale of the calamity. Local authorities and the community are rallying around the grieving family to provide support and comfort during this darkest of times. Despite the timing of the incident and the swollen creek, law enforcement authorities confirm that weather did not play a role in the occurrence. \\"This accident is not weather-related at all,\\" says the local sheriff, dismissing any connection between the rainfall and the tragedy. As the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident, the father has understandably raised questions and concerns about his potential role in the devastating event. Preliminary investigations are underway, with alcohol testing results scheduled to be released on the same day as the funeral for the six victims. The potential role that intoxication could have had in the crash will be revealed alongside the grieving family saying their final goodbyes. The incident has shaken the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to its core, as families come together to face the heartbreak. A sense of indescribable sadness has consumed the community, with friends and relatives supporting one another through the shared pain. The funeral for the six victims will be a day filled with tremendous sorrow and grief, not only for the mom and dad surviving the accident but also for the extended family and community mourning their loss. Amid continued investigations into the cause of the catastrophe, the family must also confront the possibility of fault lying with the father. As the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians come together in mourning, seeking solace and healing, it is vital that the necessary support and care are available for the bereaved family. The pain of losing five children is unimaginable, and the journey towards finding closure and peace will be a long and challenging one for the parents, siblings, grandparents, and other family members. In the wake of this tragedy, it is crucial for the community to be a source of kindness, understanding, and compassion, fostering strength in their unity and shared grief. As the investigations into the incident continue, it is imperative to find a balance between seeking answers and respecting the family's need for space and healing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A great review typically contains specific information, remains concise without any spelling or grammatical errors; it remains balanced and honest, and conveys information that is helpful to the reader. Based on these criteria, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the review in question with respect to the 1-5 scale. 1. Specificity: \\"Hate it\\" provides little information about the product or service being reviewed. It does not detail the reasons for the dissatisfaction or any particular aspect that the reviewer found objectionable. As a result, potential users cannot make an informed decision based on this review. Score: 1 2. Conciseness: While concise, the review lacks the necessary substance to provide valuable information to potential users. A brief review can still be useful if it highlights specific pros or cons, but \\"Hate it\\" offers no such insight. Score: 1 3. Spelling and grammar: The review contains only two words, and they are both spelled correctly. Grammatically, the statement is understandable, but it does not follow complete standard sentence structure. Nevertheless, it is still easy to comprehend. Score: 3 4. Balance and honesty: It is impossible to determine if the review is balanced or honest because it does not provide any context or reasoning for the strong dislike expressed. The review could be honest but is too vague to assess its balance. Score: 1 5.

Rumors have begun swirling around the fate of John Kelly the White House chief of staff who has found himself at the center of a firestorm in recent days amid allegations that a top Trump administration staffer had abused his ex-wives. Kelly expressed to Trump on Friday that he was willing to resign over the ordeal sources close to Trump told ABC News. The New York Times also reported that Kelly told West Wing officials that he was willing to resign. It's unclear whether Trump will ask for his resignation. Sources familiar with the situation told ABC they didn't believe Kelly 's departure was imminent. Rob Porter the former White House staff secretary resigned on Wednesday after news outlets published his ex-wives' allegations. But the scandal continued to build after news surfaced that Kelly and others in the White House knew for months about the accusations â and built up Porter's role within the West Wing anyway. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told CNN that Kelly has not offered his resignation. But Trump is reportedly furious with Kelly over his handling of the issue. Kelly issued a statement after the allegations were first published by the Daily Mail on Tuesday vehemently praising Porter as a \\"man of true integrity and honor.\\" \\"I was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter \\" Kelly said. \\"There is no place for domestic violence in our society.\\" Kelly is on shaky ground Trump was so infuriated by the ordeal he even phoned Reince Priebus the previous chief of staff who was ousted after he also attracted Trump's ire to vent about Kelly The New York Times reported.

Kevin McCarthy of California The New York Times and ABC News reported.

Reporter Marine Olivesi was there and tells Melissa Block the home was crowded with Libyans eager to take a photo with the corpse of their former leader. Copyright © 2011 National Public Radio®. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: I'm Melissa Block. And we begin this hour with the death of a dictator. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOUTING) BLOCK: Shaky video broadcast on Al-Jazeera shows men in the Libyan city of Sirte jostling around the body of Moammar Gadhafi. He's lying shirtless and bloodied on the ground. SIEGEL: Gadhafi ruled Libya for 42 years, a regime of extreme brutality. Today, his opponents said that chapter has been closed. (SOUNDBITE OF TV BROADCAST) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Through Translator) We announce to the world - we announce to the world the - that Moammar Gadhafi has been killed. BLOCK: That announcement came from Libya's Transitional National Council. Celebration erupted in Tripoli, and here in Washington, D.C., President Obama said this is a momentous day in the history of Libya. President BARACK OBAMA: The dark shadow of tyranny has been lifted, and with this enormous promise, the Libyan people now have a great responsibility: to build an inclusive and tolerant and democratic Libya that stands as the ultimate rebuke to Gadhafi's dictatorship. SIEGEL: The circumstances of the Libyan leader's death remain unclear. We know there was heavy fighting in Sirte, Gadhafi's hometown and stronghold. Video has circulated of him captured alive but injured, and leaders of the new Libyan government say he was shot and killed in a gun battle between his captors and his supporters. BLOCK: Gadhafi's body was taken from Sirte to the city of Misrata, and that's where we've reached freelance reporter Marine Olivesi. Marine, I gather, you saw the body of Moammar Gadhafi. MARINE OLIVESI: The bodies of both Moammar Gadhafi and his son Mutassim Gadhafi have been brought to an individual house about 15 minutes drive from the center of Misrata. It's really unclear how he ended up there. It's been very difficult to look at him exactly. There were several rumors about his location, but we saw him in the main hallway of that private house. His body is lying on a mattress. There are people around trying to take pictures with him. It's clear that he was injured to the chest. He received several gunshots to the chest. He is lying there just with pants on, and, again, people crowding around, trying to get a picture of themselves with the dead body of Moammar Gadhafi. BLOCK: And the people who are crowding around, Marine, these are people who live in Misrata? These are fighters? OLIVESI: These are all people from Misrata. A lot of them have been fighting. People in Misrata, it has a specific meaning to them that the body was brought here because, as one of the Misrati here told me, they have been waiting for that moment for so long, and the town has suffered so much through the Libyan revolution. I mean, one person beside me couldn't wait to get a picture with Moammar Gadhafi so that he can show his mom because he lost two brothers in the siege of Misrata, and that would mean a lot to his mother to see for herself the dead body of Moammar Gadhafi. So there's a sense of closure, it felt like it, for a lot of people here, for who the death of Moammar Gadhafi marks the end of those eight months and the end of the Libyan revolution. BLOCK: I've been talking with freelance reporter Marine Olivesi. She's in the Libyan city of Misrata, where the body of Moammar Gadhafi was taken today. Marine, thank you very much.

A number of photos and videos depicting Gaddafi both before and after his death have made their way onto the Internet. Getty has obtained a set of photos confirming the death, available below. WARNING: The photos below are graphic. Gaddafi was captured and eventually killed in the northern Libyan city of Sirte. His son Mutassim was also killed when the rebels captured the city, Reuters reports. According to the Associated Press: Arab broadcasters showed graphic images of the balding, goateed Gadhafi – wounded, with a bloodied face and shirt – but alive. Later video showed fighters rolling Gadhafi's lifeless body over on the pavement, stripped to the waist and a pool of blood under his head. While he was still alive, the fighters drove him around lying on the hood of a truck, perhaps to parade him in public. One fighter held him down, pressing on his thigh with a pair of shoes in a show of contempt. Following the demise of one of the world's most notorious dictators, attention will turn to Libya's new government. |||||","completion":"The body of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi was displayed in a private house in Misrata after he was killed by Libyan rebels.

We have this problem: -12 * o + 5 + 7 = 0 The first thing we need to do is add the numbers 5 and 7. Think of it like having 5 apples and 7 apples, how many apples do we have in total? That's right, we have 12 apples! Now our problem looks like this: -12 * o + 12 = 0 Next, we need to get rid of the 12 on the same side as \\"o\\". Since it's \\"+12\\", we need to subtract 12 from both sides. Imagine having 12 jellybeans and taking away 12 jellybeans; we are left with no jellybeans. That's what's happening on the one side: -12 * o = -12 Now, to find \\"o\\", we have to get rid of the \\"-12\\" that's being multiplied by it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -12. Just like sharing 12 cookies between 12 friends, each friend will get 1 cookie. In this case, we are sharing -12 by -12. When negative is divided by negative, it becomes positive. So we get: o = 1 So, the solution for the math problem is o = 1. Great job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The decision of English Premier League giants Manchester United to ban their players from signing autographs at the team's training ground won't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly, an industry expert says. Sorry kids: Manchester United will no longer be giving autographs at their Carrington training ground. The move to ban autographs was announced by Sir Alex Ferguson in the team's match day program for Saturday's 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers at Old Trafford. Ferguson said in the program he wanted to put a stop to memorabilia dealers using the autographs for financial gain. \\"I offer apologies to fans who come to the Carrington training ground looking for autographs, he wrote. \\"The problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise. They are not fans at all,\\" Ferguson said. While the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association declined to comment on the issue, a spokesman from a Kent-based supporters' club \\"Invicta Reds\\" said he was happy to agree with the manager's decision. \\"If Fergie (Sir Alex Ferguson) likes it then it's good for us all,\\" the spokesman told CNN. Do you feel autograph-hunters need to be targeted or is this unfair on other fans? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. The decision comes at a time when the market for replica jerseys and other autographed football memorabilia continues to grow significantly. A quick trawl of the UK's version of auction site eBay shows almost 16,000 autographed football items for sale. These items include signed jerseys, cards, photos, books and prints. Prices vary greatly, however, a David Beckham Manchester United shirt was selling for £300 (436) on Monday. Vice-president of operations at sportsmemorabilia.com, Mike Gallucci, speaking to CNN, estimated the autographed memorabilia industry was worth about 4 billion a year. \\"It has definitely been growing, it's big business. In the past, people hadn't realized the price they could get for some of these items. \\"The power of the Internet has changed this. However, with more players signing more autographs, the market is a little flooded with the items,\\" he said. Gallucci said less accessibility to players for some fans shouldn't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular. \\"People who want a 100 percent genuine item will buy through a company where they can verify the authenticity,\\" he said. A spokeswoman for eBay said the trading of football memorabilia was very popular on the site and had grown in recent years. More than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months, and eBay had noticed \\"a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money,\\" the spokeswoman told CNN. In the U.S. market, players in sports such as baseball sometimes only signed autographed items on pre-arranged and contracted deals with memorabilia companies, Galluci said. A 2007 Forbes magazine list rating the top ten sports collectibles ranked baseball star Mark McGwire's record 70th home-run ball as the most expensive -- with an estimated value of 3,005,000. All of the top ten items on the list are baseball memorabilia. See the list here.

Plot title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy.

Catches a mouse in its talons. Step 2: Understanding the perturbation hypothesis: The perturbation hypothesis states: \\"Suppose the owl is feeding less young.\\" This implies that the owl has fewer young ones to feed. Step 3: Assessing the effect of the perturbation hypothesis: We need to determine if this perturbation (feeding fewer young) has a direct or indirect effect on the process, particularly on the step, \\"The owl catches more mice.\\" Step 4: Consider the implications of the perturbation: If the owl is feeding fewer young, the demand for food might decrease. In other words, the owl would not need to catch as many mice as before to satisfy the hunger of its young. Step 5: Analyzing the potential effect on the process: a. The owl leaving its nest might not be affected. b. The owl flying out into the night might not be affected. c. The owl looking down at the ground might not be affected. d. The owls keen eyesight allowing it to see in the dark might not be affected. e. The owls sensitive hearing allowing it to locate hidden prey might not be affected. f. The owl swooping down might be affected indirectly, as the owl might swoop down less frequently if it needs fewer mice to feed its young. g. The owl catching a mouse in its talons might be affected indirectly. Since the owl has fewer young to feed, it may catch fewer mice in response to the reduced demand for food. Step 6: Concluding the effect of the perturbation hypothesis: The perturbation hypothesis affects the last two steps of the process (swooping down and catching mice) indirectly. The owl might catch fewer mice due to the reduced demand for food caused by feeding fewer young.

Please answer the following question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday.

Step 1: Combine like terms. 108*v + 550*v = (108 + 550)*v = 658*v Step 2: Move constant terms to the other side of the equation. 658*v + (33998 + 21274) = 0 658*v + 55272 = 0 Subtract 55272 from both sides of the equation: 658*v = -55272 Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of v (658) to isolate v. v = -55272/658 Now, I will simplify the fraction. v ≈ -84.0182 So, v ≈ -84.0182."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other. Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either. When they are measured independently, the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined, rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual as determined using the Kinsey Scale. Question: What did the research performed in the 1970s show about masculinity and feminity?","completion":"The research performed in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity showed that these concepts are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on separate scales rather than on a single continuum with each end representing opposite extremes. This approach allows for a person to be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine, instead of these traits being a tradeoff where increasing one would require decreasing the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The psychologist hates phonology.","completion":"Yes, the given sentence \\"The psychologist hates phonology\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break down the parts of the sentence to further evaluate its structure and meaning: 1. Syntax: The syntax of a sentence pertains to its grammatical structure and the arrangement of its words and phrases. In the given sentence, we have the following components: - Determiner: \\"The\\" - Noun (subject): \\"psychologist\\" - Verb (main action): \\"hates\\" - Noun (object): \\"phonology\\" This sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentence structure, which is common in English. The subject and object are both nouns, while the verb is properly conjugated according to the subject. In this case, the subject is in the third person singular form, so the verb \\"hate\\" is correctly conjugated to \\"hates.\\" 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. A sentence is said to be semantically acceptable if its words and phrases come together to form a coherent and logically sound meaning. In the given sentence, we have the following meanings: - Psychologist: A professional or academic expert in the study of the human mind and behavior. - Hates: A strong feeling of dislike or aversion. - Phonology: A branch of linguistics concerned with the study of the sound systems of languages and the organization of sounds in spoken words. These components convey a clear and meaningful idea: A psychologist holds a strong aversion or dislike for the study of phonology. While it might seem unusual for a psychologist to hate phonology, depending on their area of expertise or personal preference, it's not impossible. The sentence makes logical sense, therefore, it's semantically acceptable. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The psychologist hates phonology\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable, as it follows the proper grammar rules, has an SVO structure, the verb is conjugated correctly, and the words convey a coherent and logically sound meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Piers Morgan , however, decided that this was a good time to share his theory that Ali said far more racist comments than presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump . Chris Brown , known for not being afraid to speak his mind, clapped back with a vicious rebuttal. And he wasn't the only musician who critiqued Morgan for his negative words on the late boxer. Morgan tweeted out his thoughts about Ali just two days after his passing, and Chris Brown was having none of it. Muhammad Ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims. #fact Breezy took Morgan to task in a expletive laden comment on Instagram: \\"Irrelevant BROADCASTING!!!!!

Over the weekend the outspoken host was met with a backlash when he claimed Ali was responsible for a number of 'racist' comments following his death on Friday. He tweeted: \\"Muhammad Ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims. #fact.\\" Piers looked to be trying to justify his comments about the boxer when he presented Good Morning Britain on Monday. (Image: ITV) Speaking to barrister Miranda Brawn, he said: \\"There was another side to Ali, he was incredibly controversial.\\" Piers continued: \\"His preferred world is segregated. Black people living with black people, white people living with white people.\\" He then added that some of Ali's comments about race relations would receive 'an incredibly different reaction' if they were said now. (Image: ITV) But guest Miranda didn't let Piers' comments go uncontested as she set the record straight about Ali's racial agenda. She instead reminded Piers that Ali was integral in helping improve self-pride amongst black people. She explained: \\"If you look at the interview where he said that, he said we've got to get the black people sorted first. We've got to integrate black people and make them have a sense of pride. She added: \\"He was one of the first black people to say being black is beautiful.\\" (Image: ITV) Piers would then try to agree, calling Ali a 'pivotal figure' and questioning why more black athletes don't follow his lead when it comes to political issues.

Less than 48 hours after Muhammad Ali’s death, Piers Morgan trolled Twitter by claiming that the boxing legend was more racist than Donald Trump — and John Legend and Chrissy Teigen were not having it. On Sunday, June 5, the British journalist, 51, tweeted, “Muhammad Ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims. #fact.

No coats of sugar please.” Steve Granitz/WireImage.com; Paul Drinkwater/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images The controversial post immediately made headlines as social media users slammed Morgan, who responded in a series of follow-up tweets, writing, “Why would stating that Muhammad Ali made a lot of inflammatory, race-charged statements in his life be remotely controversial? He did. I’m sorry for ‘saying inflammatory things for attention.’ That’s the last thing Muhammad Ali would have condoned.” Legend, 37, came across the TV personality’s tweets and responded, “You could test us by announcing your retirement,” to which Teigen, 30, joined in, replying to her hubby, “From what? Trolling isn’t a job (I’ve tried).” Focus on Sport/Getty Images Morgan fired back at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, writing, “Maybe I should take up a proper job, like modeling?” “It keeps me nice and not-racist so sure, give it a go,” she responded. The Daily Mail Online U.S. editor-at-large shot back, “I’m not racist either, so that makes two of us.” But it was Teigen who got the last laugh, jabbing, “Remember when Bruce Willis didn’t know he was dead?

What you might not realize is that your blood is also affected by a lack of exercise. You can actually reduce your cholesterol levels by adding more exercise, and thus more fitness, to your life. Increasing your physical activity and fitness level has a direct impact on your body's ability to manage cholesterol. When you exercise, your body not only burns calories and strengthens muscles, but it also improves circulation and helps in removing LDL (low-density lipoprotein), or \\"bad\\" cholesterol, from your bloodstream and transporting it back to the liver. Simultaneously, exercise helps increase the levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein), or \\"good\\" cholesterol, which plays a vital role in removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and reducing the risk of plaque build-up in your arteries. Here are some tips to effectively use increased fitness to lower your cholesterol: 1. Start with moderate-intensity exercises: Begin with activities such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling to gradually build up your stamina and endurance. 2. Incorporate strength-training exercises: Resistance exercises like weightlifting, yoga, or bodyweight exercises can significantly improve muscle strength and help in controlling your cholesterol levels. 3. Engage in aerobic activities: Ideally, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week to maintain good heart health. 4. Make exercise a daily habit: Create a routine that includes physical activity, aiming for at least 30 minutes of exercise daily. Consistency in exercise is key to reducing cholesterol levels. 5. Combine physical activity with a healthy diet: A balanced diet that is low in saturated fats and high in fiber can supplement your exercise efforts to maintain healthy cholesterol levels effectively. 6. Consult a healthcare professional: If you have existing health conditions or are new to exercise, it is important to discuss your fitness plan with a healthcare professional to ensure it is safe and suitable for your individual needs. By understanding the effects of exercise on blood cholesterol levels and putting these strategies into practice, you can significantly lower your risk of developing heart disease and improve your overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Art Spiegelman (; born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev on February 15, 1948) is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus. His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor Hired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years. Spiegelman's first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentine's Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing. The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices. Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student. Spiegelman had twenty-one New Yorker covers published, and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous. Within The New Yorker's pages, Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration titled \\"In the Dumps\\" with children's illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz titled \\"Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy\\". An essay he had published there on Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man, called \\"Forms Stretched to their Limits\\" was to form the basis for a book in 2001 about Cole called Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to their Limits. The same year, Voyager Company published a CD-ROM version of Maus with extensive supplementary material called The Complete Maus, and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called The Wild Party. Spiegelman contributed the essay \\"Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist\\" in the September 1, 1997 issue of Mother Jones. Spiegelman's influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999. In an article titled \\"The King of Comix\\" in The Village Voice, Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to \\"make or break\\" a cartoonist's career in New York, while denigrating Spiegelman as \\"a guy with one great book in him\\". Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall's name to thirty professionals; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for 1.5 million. Hellman published a \\"Legal Action Comics\\" benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal. In 1997, Spiegelman had his first children's book published: Open Me... I'm a Dog, with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop-ups and an attached leash. From 2000 to 2003 Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children's comics anthology Little Lit, with contributions from Raw alumni and children's book authors and illustrators. what happened?","completion":"Art Spiegelman is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus.

Paul won the match. Which player had an increased hear rate before the match? Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Answer:","completion":"Paul had an increased heart rate before the match, as he had plenty of time to do his warm-up properly which increased his blood flow to the muscles and heart rate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 - November 29, 1986) was an English-American actor, known as one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and became known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and light-hearted approach to acting and sense of comic timing. He became an American citizen in 1942. Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age, and began performing with a troupe known as \\"The Penders\\" from the age of six. Context: Stirling refers to Grant as \\"one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood\\". His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant's business interests, so that by 1939, he was \\"already an astute operator with various commercial interests\\". Scott also played a role, encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares, making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. In the 1940s, Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village, and teamed with Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there. Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind, to the point that his friend David Niven once said: \\"Before computers went into general release, Cary had one in his brain\\". Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant's intelligence came across on screen, and stated that \\"no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time\\". After Grant retired from the screen, he became more active in business. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported 15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about 50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working. In 1975, Grant was an appointed director of MGM. In 1980, he sat on the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company. He played an active role in the promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973, and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s. When Allan Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed how tired Grant looked, and his \\"slightly melancholic air\\". Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California), and Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987). Question: what happend in 1940. Whats the answer?","completion":"In 1940, many things happened around the world, but in relation to Cary Grant, he was acting in Hollywood and had started investing his money in shares and other businesses. This made him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. Grant's friend, Howard Hughes, helped him with his business interests, and during the 1940s, he also invested in real estate development in Acapulco, Mexico, with other famous people like Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton.

A source familiar with the situation now tells Fox411 that Ireland was not with her father in New York at the time of the 911 call. Instead, she likely called from Los Angeles, seemingly refuting earlier reports that the 14-year-old found her father unresponsive. Medics rushed to the actor’s apartment before taking him to Lenox Hill hospital, NBC said. He was reportedly released after an hour of treatment at around 1 a.m. According to a report from the New York Post, the initial 911 call came in as a“possible alcohol or drug overdose.” Sources told the newspaper that while he never actually ingested sleeping pills, Baldwin threatened to take them during a heated argument. Matthew Hiltzik, a rep for Baldwin, tells Fox411 that the situation was a \\"misunderstanding on one person's part\\" and that actor is “completely fine and is at work today.\\" Hiltzik added that Baldwin's quick release indicated that there were no serious health concerns. \\"If there was any real issue or concern, he would not have been released from the hospital so quickly,\\" Hiltzik said.

Emmy-winning actor Alec Baldwin blew a gasket Thursday and attacked a photographer while police and a pack of reporters looked on with amazement. \\"This guy! This guy!\\" the actor yelled as he burst out of a lobby and grabbed New York Post photographer Tim Wiencis by the collar. Cops immediately pulled the actor off Wiencis and hustled him back inside. A witness said Baldwin was pacing around the lobby muttering: \\"They are the lowest scum of the Earth. They are the lowest scum of the Earth.\\" Meanwhile, an incredulous Wiencis told cops, \\"He just assaulted me.\\" No charges were filed. Baldwin's bizarre outburst capped a day that began at 12:55 a.m., when he was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital after his 14-year-old daughter, Ireland, dialed 911, sources said. \\"I'm tired of this,\\" Baldwin said, his daughter told the dispatcher. \\"I'm going to take some pills. I'm going to end this.\\" When cops arrived at Baldwin's pad on Central Park West, the actor told them he took an Ambien sleeping pill and had \\"no intention\\" of committing suicide, sources said. Baldwin, who is due to emcee the Oscars on March 7, told cops he and Ireland had been arguing over the phone and that his daughter was \\"put up\\" to dial 911 by her mom, actress Kim Basinger, sources said. Still, cops had Baldwin checked out and doctors released him after deciding he was no threat to himself, sources said. When the \\"30 Rock\\" star returned home, he found reporters on his doorstep. \\"This is another example of Kim's sickness,\\" a buddy of Baldwin's told the Daily News. \\"Alec came back from the hospital and there were cameras outside his house at 2 a.m. Gee, I wonder how they found out?\\" Baldwin went to work at 7 a.m., and when he came home around 5:30 p.m. the reporters were still there. It was then that Wiencis lightly tapped Baldwin on the arm and the actor exploded, according to witnesses. \\"Don't touch me!\\" Baldwin yelled. \\"I'm calling the cops!\\" There was no comment from Basinger, whose divorce from Baldwin has been a Hollywood horror show that has left their daughter torn between warring parents. Baldwin and Ireland also have had a rocky relationship, a fact that was revealed in spectacular fashion when a voice mail of the actor calling his spawn a \\"rude, thoughtless little pig\\" was leaked in 2007. csiemaszko@nydailynews.com With Jonathan Lemire and George Rush ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Actor Alec Baldwin was taken to a New York City hospital after his daughter Ireland called 911, concerned for her father's health.

Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame is to be taught by Professor Mathieu Deflem, a fan of the singer. The course, which has its own blog, is due to start in spring 2011. The Belgian born sociologist, whose research interests also include counter-terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times. \\"We're going to look at Lady Gaga as a social event,\\" Prof Deflem told the USC student newspaper, the Daily Gamecock. \\"So it's not the person, and it's not the music. It's more this thing out there in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter. I mean, that's a social phenomenon.\\".

In a study of 11,644 middle-aged Swedish twins who were followed for 43 years, researchers compared the effects of an average of more than two drinks daily (\\"heavy drinking\\") to less than half a drink daily (\\"light drinking\\"). The study showed that: *Heavy drinkers had about a 34 percent higher risk of stroke compared to light drinkers. *Mid-life heavy drinkers (in their 50s and 60s) were likely to have a stroke five years earlier in life _ of genetic and early-life factors. *Heavy drinkers had increased stroke risk in their mid-life compared to well-known risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. *At around age 75, blood pressure and diabetes appeared to take over as one of the main influences on having a stroke. Past studies have shown that alcohol affects stroke risk, but this is the first study to pinpoint differences with age. \\"We now have a clearer picture about these risk factors----how they change with age and how the influence of drinking alcohol shifts as we get older,\\" said Pavla Kadlecova, M.Sc., a statistician at St. Anne's University Hospital's International Clinical Research Center in the Czech Republic.

Symptoms of a cold become noticeable one or two days after you have been in contact with the virus. If your symptoms last for longer than 14 days, they may be caused by allergies, or you may have a bacterial infection. If your temperature is anywhere between 37.2°C to 37.8°C or 99°F to 100°F, then you have a low grade fever. When your body starts fighting off an infection, such as a cold virus, it releases pyrogens, which make your body’s temperature rise. Many microorganisms, including some cold viruses, cannot live through these increased temperatures. Infections can cause you to feel both tired and achy. This is because when your body is fighting off an infection, your muscles can become inflamed. This inflammation can be interpreted in your brain as pain, leading to you feeling tired and uncomfortable. When your body is dealing with an infection, your normal eating habits may change.

Write a summary based on this article: Spectacle seemed to delight visitors but zoo has been criticised in the past for keeping animals in ‘woefully inadequate’ conditions Visitors to a newly reopened zoo in North Korea have been flocking to a new attraction: a smoking chimpanzee. According to officials at the Central zoo in Pyongyang, which has been criticised for animal cruelty in the past, the 19-year-old female chimpanzee Azalea, Dallae in Korean, smokes a pack a day. The chimpanzee can use a lighter to light her own cigarettes, or spark up from a lit cigarette. The zoo has insisted, however, that she does not inhale. North Korea claims 'new liver medicine made at national zoo' Read more The spectacle, which would shock animal rights campaigners, made visitors roar with laughter on Wednesday as the chimpanzee sat puffing away. Her trainer seemed to be encouraging the smoking and prompted her to touch her nose, bow thank you and do a simple dance. The zoo is pulling in thousands of visitors a day to see attractions ranging from elephants, giraffes, penguins and monkeys to a hi-tech natural history museum. NK News reported North Korea has stocked the zoo with animals from all over the world, with many of the deals being called into question by animal rights campaigners. The zoo has also been criticised in the past for keeping animals in “woefully inadequate” conditions. Renovations at the zoo began in 2014 as part of efforts by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to create leisure centres around the capital. Another popular attraction is the dog pavilion. The zoo also arranges performances featuring other animals trained to do tricks, including a monkey that slam dunks basketballs and doves that fly around and land on a woman skating on an indoor stage. ||||| She’s bananas for nicotine. According to officials at the Pyongyang Zoo, 19-year-old chimpanzee Azalea, who goes by “Dallae” in Korea, smokes roughly one pack of cigarettes per day. Not to worry, though, officials say she never inhales the smoke, but it seems has picked up the habit for fun. The chill chimp is familiar with the routine of smoking and waits on her human trainer to toss a lighter her way when she needs one. Bill stopping circus use of wild animals would show NYC is humane If a lighter isn’t available, Azalea uses a lit cigarette as an alternative. The newly-renovated zoo attracts thousands of visitors every day, as it features other fascinating animals and displays of the solar system and evolution of life. Azalea, a Korean zoo chimpanzee, loves to smoke and entertain her guests by performing and dancing. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) (Wong Maye-E/AP) Some viewers are outraged by the risky routine allowed by zoo officials, especially PETA, who recently released a displeased statement to TIME magazine. Others are charmed, as the cute chimp also loves to entertain guests by performing and dancing — even taking a bow at their request. According to ABC News, the zoo shows other animals that love tricks, such as doing slam dunks and even solving math equations. The zoo orininally opened back in 1959, but its new distinctive demeanor developed in 2014. ||||| Officials at the zoo claim Azalea, whose name in Korean is \\"Dallae\\", doesn’t actually inhale the cigarette smoke. AP witnessed entertained visitors at the zoo laughing as Azalea’s trainer encouraged her to smoke the cigarettes. The trainer also prompted her to touch her nose, bow thank you and do a simple dance. Animal rights group, the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), criticised the zoo for keeping the animals to ‘attract gawkers’. “This exemplifies the problem with any captive wildlife displayed for profit,” said Carter Dillard, Director of Litigation for the ALDF. “They are made to do unnatural and freakish things to attract gawkers. “The good news is that the civilised world is moving away from this, like the gradual elimination of orcas from places like Seaworld.” Elisa Allen, Director PETA UK, said: “If we really needed any more proof that zoos are motivated by profit and not animal welfare, this is surely it. “Smoking is as dangerous to Azalea the chimpanzee as it is to humans, and yet her ‘caretakers’ facilitate her habit – just for the sake of a few cheap laughs and more bodies coming through the gates. “Anyone who cares about protecting animals should donate to programmes that help them in their natural habitats, where they're free to engage in natural behaviour, and stay away from these glorified prisons that objectify sensitive animals.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"Visitors to the newly reopened Central zoo in Pyongyang, North Korea, have been surprised to find a new attraction – a smoking chimpanzee.

Question: When did Thayer return to Mexico to Film Movie plot title: And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself Movie plot: Mexico, 1912. Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa (Antonio Banderas) finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers in Hollywood to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith (Colm Feore) is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team arrive in Mexico and film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film.Over a year later in 1913, Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screen writers, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor. The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film.Another few months later, Villa then assembles an army to attack a Federal held fort at Torreon. Thayer and his team go into film the action. After a skirmish on the way to the fort, Villa's army arrives at Torreon and lays siege to the fortress. Villa orders an attack and personally leads the charge. Villa's army is initially successful, but they suffer heavy casualties and are forced to withdraw.That night, Villa orders his army to bombard Torreon into submission, and, after a long, brutal bombardment, Villa's cavalry finish off the last of Torreon's Federal defenders.

His father is Irish and his mother is Jewish. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish Catholic and German descent, respectively. On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was involved in the crash of a Bell 206L4 LongRanger helicopter (N36R). The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an autorotation with powered recovery, Ford allowed the aircraft's altitude to drop to 150-200 feet before beginning power-up. The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground. The aircraft landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log, flipping the aircraft onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. When asked about the incident by fellow pilot James Lipton in an interview on the TV show Inside the Actor's Studio, Ford replied, \\"I broke it.\\" On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California.

After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park.

The old linoleum simply no longer met those requirements. (I) Linoleum was old. After considering various options, Sarah decided to go with tile floors. Despite being a little more expensive than linoleum, tile had many advantages. One of the main reasons Sarah chose tile was because of its durability. High-quality tile can last for decades, whereas linoleum usually needs to be replaced every 10-20 years. Moreover, Sarah wanted a more timeless and elegant look for her home. Tiles, especially natural stone or ceramic, are known for their classic beauty. They allow for a variety of designs and patterns, which gave Sarah the flexibility she needed to create a sophisticated and unique atmosphere in her living space. Being environmentally conscious, Sarah was also drawn to the eco-friendly aspects of tile. Many tiles are made from natural materials like clay, glass, and sand, whereas linoleum can be less environmentally friendly due to the presence of PVC in its composition. Tiles are recyclable and can be reused in a variety of creative ways, such as in garden paths or as decorative pieces. During the installation process, Sarah paid close attention to detail. She carefully selected a reputable tile contractor who helped her choose the best type of tile for her home based on her budget, lifestyle, and design preferences. Together, they evaluated factors such as water resistance, durability, and slip resistance. The process of installing the new tile floors took some time, but Sarah knew that the effort would be worth it. As the work progressed, she started to see the transformation of her living space. The old, worn-out linoleum had been replaced by elegant, modern, and practical tile floors. Once the floors were installed, Sarah took the time to find the right furnishings and decorations to complement the new flooring. She wanted to make sure that everything in her home worked well together and created a cohesive and stylish look.

PUBLISHED:. 23:32 EST, 15 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 00:36 EST, 16 June 2013. Ryan Ferguson was 21 when he sentenced to 40 years in prison for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the night in question. The only evidence that linked Ferguson to the murder of a sports editor, found strangled in his office car park in Columbia, Missouri, was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath. But despite the appeals and extensive campaigns spearheaded by Ferguson's father, Bill, and documentary on CBS's 48 Hours, the young man remains in prison for a crime he vehemently denies being involved in. Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt. Two years after Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, 2001, Erikson told police he believed he was involved. He told police the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question. After reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him. In his police interviews Erikson, who was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly stating that Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt. He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him. 'The police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit. Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper. Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved. Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested the young men. 'Everything is wrong about this case,. everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen. Zellner, who is working of Ferguson's appeal, told the court. Ferguson has denied being involved in the case, throughout his arrest, trial and seven appeals. He stated to police that on the night Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. When his latest appeal was denied, Ferguson told CBS: 'I just sat in this room by myself. And. just stared at the floor ... and it's frustrating because you don't know,. even with all the facts, if you'll ever get your life back.' The appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated Ferguson both admitting they lied. Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two. Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park. Erikson, who is serving a. 25-year-sentence, is now saying that although he still has no memory of. the night in question, he believes he acted alone. Tribune janitor Jerry Trump, who said. he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that. he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown. In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.' He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.' According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated. Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it. A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said. He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries. He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time. the crime was reported. According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am,. only six minutes before 911 was called. Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released. Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to. the car park later that night after hearing about the murder. Ferguson's family and lawyer continue to fight for the young man's conviction to be overturned. 'I've always felt that the system works,' Ms Zellner said, as she explained her determination to have him freed. 'He is absolutely innocent. ...I don't want to be part of a system that cannot recognize and correct an error.' What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article discusses the critical details of a true-crime case involving Ryan Ferguson, who was sentenced to life imprisonment due to his alleged involvement in the murder of Kent Heitholt, the sports editor of the Columbia Daily Tribune in 2001. The main points can be summarized as follows: 1. Circumstances of the crime: In November 2001, Heitholt was found strangled to death by his own belt in his office car park in Columbia, Missouri. The case remained unsolved for two years until Ferguson's friend, Chuck Erikson, alleged he and Ferguson were involved in the murder. Erikson and Ferguson were 17 at the time and had been drinking underage on the night of the murder. 2. Erikson's testimony: Erikson, who could not remember the details of the night due to his alcohol and drug consumption, wrongfully shared certain details about the crime, which differed from the actual facts. He alleged that he and Ferguson were responsible for the murder when he became convinced that a photo-fit image of a man seen at the scene resembled him. 3. Ryan Ferguson's involvement and denial: The only evidence that linked Ferguson to Heitholt’s murder was Erikson's testimony and that of two other witnesses. Despite these testimonies, Ferguson has vehemently denied involvement in the murder. 4. Evidence at the crime scene: A range of forensics, including fingerprints and a bloody footprint, found at the scene, did not match either Erikson or Ferguson. However, police arrested them anyhow based on the testimonies. 5. Recanted Testimonies: The two witnesses who initially implicated Ferguson in the crime later recanted their statements under oath. Even Erikson, who is serving a 25-year sentence, has now stated that he believes he acted alone and that implicating Ferguson was a mistake. 6. Flaws in the investigation: Many questions have been raised about the process of investigation, including the failure to thoroughly investigate Michael Boyd, the last person to see Heitholt alive. 7. Ferguson's Fight: Ryan’s father, Bill Ferguson, along with his daughter, Kelly, have launched extensive campaigns to have the conviction overturned. They are being assisted by attorney Kathleen Zellner, who claims that the case is laden with numerous flaws and strongly believes in Ryan’s innocence. Despite the inconsistencies and faulty testimonies in the evidence against him, Ryan remains in prison. This case has captivated many due to the lack of concrete evidence against Ferguson, the recantation of critical testimonies, and the ongoing campaign spearheaded by his family and lawyer for his release. It also raises serious questions about the American criminal justice system, highlighting potential issues of wrongful convictions due to false confessions or testimonies, inadequate investigation, and judicial errors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: In most instances, creditors and lenders want to see a debt-to-income ratio of 36 percent or less. If your debt-to-income ratio is higher than this percentage, you might have difficulty securing a loan until after that percentage drops. A ratio of 19 percent or less is ideal, and if you can secure this level of financial security, you should have very little problem securing loans or taking on new credit. A ratio between 20 and 36 percent or less will usually be deemed healthy enough to secure a loan from most lenders, but you should begin cutting back once you . If your debt-to-income ratio is between 37 and 42 percent, you are in a state of minor financial crisis and may not be able to get any loans or new lines of credit. At a ratio between 43 and 49 percent, you will likely begin seeing financial difficulties in your everyday life in the near future. If your ratio is 50 percent or higher, you need to seek professional help to quickly reduce your debt. These are terms that are used when you are looking to secure a mortgage loan. Front-end debt ratios only use proposed monthly housing expenses, while back-end debt ratios use all existing debt and any new projected monthly mortgage payments. For most purposes, you should look at your back-end debt. Many lenders will usually look at front-end debt, but as a borrower, you should look at both front-end and back-end debt to determine how much you can actually afford regarding new loans and credit. Front-end debt-to-income ratios are also known as housing-expense-to-income ratios. This percentage should be at or below 28 percent, while a back-end debt-to-income ratio should be at or below 36 percent. If your debt-to-income ratio is higher than you would like it to be, you can help lower it by implementing lifestyle changes that decrease your debt levels. Increase the amount of money you pay toward your debts. If you can manage it, make extra payments toward your loan, house, car, or any other debt for which there is a principle you must pay off in addition to interest. Make sure that the payment goes toward your principle. This will lower your overall debt faster. Do not take on more debt. Put away the plastic and avoid making more purchases on your credit card. Do not apply for any other loans or lines of credit, either. Avoid making any large purchases. If you do not have much savings built up right now, wait until you do. This will allow you to make a larger down payment, and as a result, less of your purchase will be funded with credit and you can reduce the amount of debt you accumulate. Whether your debt-to-income ratio is healthy or not, monitoring it continually can help you avoid major credit problems. You should keep an eye on it even if you do not plan to make a major investment any time soon. If you know that your debt-to-income ratio is on the high end, keep tabs on it every month. Otherwise, checking the ratio once or twice a year should suffice. Having too much debt can lower your credit score, causing your lending limits to decrease and your interest rates to increase. Monitoring this ratio can help you make better decisions about buying on credit and taking loans out. It can also make the benefits of making more than your minimum credit card payments more evident and allow you to avoid major credit or financial problems in the future. If your debt-to-income ratio rises too high, you could have difficulty making major purchases and you might lose out on the lowest interest rates and best credit terms. Summary:","completion":"A debt-to-income ratio is crucial for securing loans and taking on new credit, with 36% or less generally considered acceptable by creditors and lenders. Having a ratio of 19% or less is ideal, while ratios above 37% can lead to a minor financial crisis and difficulty obtaining loans or credit. When securing a mortgage, both front-end (housing-expense-to-income) and back-end debt ratios should be considered, with percentages at or below 28% for the former and 36% for the latter. To lower your debt-to-income ratio, you can make lifestyle changes, such as increasing debt payments, avoiding new debt, and postponing large purchases. Monitoring your ratio regularly can help maintain a healthy financial state and make better credit decisions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: \\"New Humanist\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","completion":"The term \\"New Humanist\\" does not directly belong to a single category among the given choices, as it is a broader intellectual and cultural movement. However, the term can be closely related to an educational institution, artist, or a written work due to its historical and cultural implications. To provide a detailed answer, let's break it down into these three related categories. 1. Educational institution: In the context of an educational institution, New Humanist can be associated with academic programs and institutions that promote the study and development of humanism, a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively. These institutions might focus on subjects like literature, history, philosophy, and arts, fostering a deeper understanding of humanism and its impact on society. 2. Artist: New Humanist can also refer to a group of artists or intellectuals who have adopted and promoted humanist values and ideas in their work. These artists may be writers, philosophers, painters, or performers whose creative productions emphasize the potential, dignity, and beauty of human beings, as well as our capacity for rational thinking, moral and ethical understanding, and human-based solutions to complex problems. Artists influenced by humanism tend to reflect on cultural, social, and historical contexts to create thought-provoking and meaningful works of art. 3. Written work: In the context of a written work, New Humanist could be either a collection of essays, articles, or books that discuss and explore aspects of humanism or a single piece of literature that embodies humanist themes and values. \\"New\\" in this context might imply a more contemporary approach to humanism, focusing on modern issues and challenges from a humanistic perspective. Such a work would engage with questions of ethics, morality, reason, and the unique qualities of human beings, analyzing how these concepts apply to the contemporary world. In conclusion, the title \\"New Humanist\\" does not fit neatly into a single category from the given list. Instead, it can be related to an educational institution, artist, or written work due to its affiliations with the intellectual and cultural movement of humanism. Examining the term through these perspectives not only highlights its potential meanings but also further demonstrates the importance of humanism in various aspects of Western thought and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _ Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

Help as much as you can. Information: - Diatoms are a major group of algae, and are among the most common types of phytoplankton. Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. \\"Fragilaria\\"), fans (e.g. \\"Meridion\\"), zigzags (e.g. \\"Tabellaria\\"), or stars (e.g. \\"Asterionella\\"). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial \\"Bacillaria paradoxa\\", was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality. - Trigonella is a genus from the family Fabaceae. The best known member is the herb fenugreek. - Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, \\"tres\\" \\"three\\" + \\"folium\\" \\"leaf\\"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled, cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include \\"Melilotus\\" (sweet clover) and \\"Medicago\\" (alfalfa or Calvary clover). - Alfalfa , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 1020 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine. - Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, NN, to be used in other ways. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the \\"Trifolium\\" clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide. - Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (\\"M. sativa\\"), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, \\"medica\\", from median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (\\"M. arborea\\") is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in \\"Medicago\\" range from 2\\"n\\" = 14 to 48. - Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. \\"Rhizobium\\" species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of legumes and \\"\\". - Medicago falcata is a plant species of the genus Medicago . It is native to the Mediterranean basin , but is found throughout the world . It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which is capable of nitrogen fixation . Its common names include blue alfalfa , sickle alfalfa , sickle medick , yellow lucerne , and yellow - flowered alfalfa . - Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the group of saponin compounds. Triterpenes are a type of terpene containing 30 carbon atoms. Triterpenes are assembled from a five-carbon isoprene unit through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to make a thirty-carbon compound. Some triterpenes are steroidal in nature. Cholesterol, phytosterols and phytoecdysteroids are triterpenes. The triterpenes are subdivided into some 20 groups, depending on their particular structures. Some triterpenoid compounds are found as saponin glycosides which refers to the attachment of various sugar molecules to the triterpene unit. These sugars can be cleaved off in the gut by bacteria, sometimes allowing the aglycone (triterpene) to be absorbed into the bloodstream or to insert into cell membranes. - Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word \\"flavus\\" meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites. - Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. The Fabaceae include legume crops such as beans and peas. - Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium (rhizobium). It forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera \\"Medicago\\", \\"Melilotus\\" and \\"Trigonella\\", including the model legume \\"Medicago truncatula\\". This symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule. The \\"S. meliloti\\" genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases) and two chromids, pSymA (~1.4 megabases) and pSymB (~1.7 megabases). Five \\"S. meliloti\\" genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11 - Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant 1060 cm tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, 12 cm long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod. - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.

Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 2. - Sentence 2: \\"The incessant voices of the artillery.\\" - In this sentence, \\"voice\\" refers to the loud, continuous sounds produced by the firing of artillery. This usage is more literal, as it directly relates to the auditory aspect of the word \\"voice.\\" Additionally, the word \\"voices\\" is plural in this context, referring to multiple instances or sources of sound. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"voice\\" in the two sentences. - The meaning of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 1 is metaphorical and relates to an inner prompting or conscience, while in Sentence 2 it has a more literal meaning, referring to the sounds of artillery. Conclusion: The word \\"voice\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences, as its usage in Sentence 1 is metaphorical and abstract, while its usage in Sentence 2 is literal and auditory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4] Paragraph: Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match. Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more.

The barn provided a warm and cozy environment, a stark contrast to the unpredictable outside world. With a steady supply of food and a secure place to rest, the pig soon found itself saturated in a world where its demands were regularly met without so much as a snout's worth of effort. It spent its days basking in the warmth emanating from the barn's wooden walls, indulging in the sweet scent of hay that filled the air. During the sweltering summer months, the pen outside would often become unbearable. The sun's rays beat down mercilessly on the pig and its companions, leaving them tired and parched. Their cloven feet would sink into the muddy ground, encased in thick mud as flies buzzed loudly around them. On the other hand, the barn's thick walls, made of solid aged wood and layers of insulating hay, kept them comfortably protected from the relentless heat. While the pig understood that its life was vastly different than others', it did not feel the need to venture out into the pen often. It had grown quite accustomed to the pleasantries of its barn life, and even the temptation of the mud baths that the other pigs so adored was not enough to entice the pig out of its comfort zone. It had also developed a camaraderie with the other animals who called the barn their home—the goats with their curious nature, the clucking of hens, and the calming sound of the cow's unhurried munching on cud. As fall approached, the pig anticipated that the temperature in the barn would drop and the wind would blow colder outside. It might have felt a longing for the warmth of the barn as it carried on its existence in the pen, wistfully watching the barn door swing open and closed. This seasonal change would bring new experiences and challenges that the pig would have to face. There would be the arrival of new animals, all bringing their unique energy and presence to the barn. There would be new farmhands making their way through the farm, tending to the needs of the animals and keeping everything in working order. The pig would find itself learning from these changes, growing more adaptable and building resilience. It would find strength in these adaptations, showing itself that it could venture out into new territory and still find solace in the warmth it so cherished. And perhaps, in time, the pig would learn to appreciate the balance between the comfort of the barn and the excitement of the pen, for each had its own unique gifts to offer. And so, as the seasons changed and brought with them countless opportunities for growth and exploration, the pig would come to cherish both the barn and the pen. Though the warmth and comfort of the barn would always hold a special place in the pig's heart, it would learn to embrace the unpredictability and adventure that life in the pen had to offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Battery's Nightmare Portable electronics that can be carried about easily are only as good as their batteries and, let's face it, batteries aren't very good, especially when compared with, say, petrol, which packs 100 times a battery's energy into an equal space. That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched onto silicon wafers in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following best describes the goal of the tiny engine project being developed by mechanical engineers? A.

Continue the following story. In the Winter, Craig never gets sick, but Jason always has a cold.","completion":"In the small town of Willowbrook, Winter was a season of frosty mornings, hot chocolate, and snowball fights in the park. For Craig and Jason, two best friends since childhood, Winter meant ice skating on the frozen lake, building snow forts, and the unrestrained joy of school closures due to heavy snow. But there was something unusual about this duo: while Craig never fell ill during the winter months, Jason was burdened with a never-ending cold. Craig, an athletic young man with an affinity for winter sports, embraced the season wholeheartedly. His energy levels seemed to increase as the days grew colder, and as a result, he became the neighborhood's Winter Wonder-kid. His immune system was like a fortress, and no pesky cold or flu could breach its defenses. Jason, on the other hand, became the town's human tissue box during winter. Despite bundling up in layers of clothing and taking his vitamins religiously, he invariably fell prey to a stubborn cold that would last the entire season. Runny nose, cough, sneezing - the poor boy endured it all. The dichotomy in their health never affected their camaraderie, though. Craig and Jason supported each other through thick and thin. In an act of solidarity, Craig would always carry extra hand sanitizers and tissues for his friend. On particularly bad days, when going outdoors was out of the question for Jason, Craig would come over, armed with chicken soup and funny movies to make his friend feel better. As the years went by, the people of Willowbrook grew accustomed to this unlikely pair and their endearing dynamic. Many wondered about the factors that contributed to the stark contrast in the boys' health. Several theories were offered: genetics, upbringing, and exposure to germs in childhood, to name a few. Towards the end of their senior year in high school, Craig and Jason decided to participate in the science fair by researching the factors behind their contrasting winter health. They compared their lifestyles, food choices, exercise habits, family medical histories, and many other variables. They even had blood tests conducted to check for any significant differences in their immune systems. Their findings surprised everyone, including themselves. It turned out that Craig's active lifestyle and love for outdoor sports, especially in winter, boosted his immunity. His dedication to exercise and frequent exposure to colder temperatures helped train his immune system to ward off infections better than his peers. Jason, on the other hand, grew up in a family that tended to stay indoors during winter. They relied on artificial heating and minimized outdoor activities, which contributed to his body's relatively weaker defense against infections during winter months. The lack of exposure to natural elements made his immune system more vulnerable to the season's cold and flu. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Craig and Jason decided to take action. In their last year of high school, they planned to start \\"Project Winter Warrior,\\" an initiative for the entire town to engage in outdoor activities, exercise, and healthier lifestyle choices during the snowy season. They hoped that by encouraging their community to embrace the outdoors and to stay active during winter, they could minimize the instances of seasonal illness and offer residents a healthier, happier winter experience. And so, Willowbrook witnessed a remarkable transformation during the subsequent winters. Families braved the cold to ice skate, sled, and participate in snowball fights together. Exercise classes were organized, with Craig often leading the pack, and Jason, no longer the permanent tissue box, finally enjoyed winters with his best friend in the cold, fresh air. They succeeded in making their beloved town stronger and more resilient, not only to the common cold but also to the overwhelming power of togetherness and shared experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Having not seen all the films released in 2002, I can't say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year. Most American films featuring black people either obsess over the American preoccupation with \\"race relations\\", or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto, with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic-phrased slang. Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur. Antwone Fisher's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual. He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to have the film made, sticks to the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the Antwone Fisher story. At a time when BET, and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us. I just hope that the non-Black audience will go see this film for that humanity, rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with.

Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is there 500 acres of on Upper Table Rock? Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene, a braided river system called the \\"Ancestral Rogue River\\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved. For about 2.1 million years, the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone. Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley. Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210 m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44-mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley. This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation. At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of 730 feet (220 m) and thinned to about 100 to 200 feet (30 to 61 m) to the north of Medford. Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the solidified lava. Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. This erosion created expansive talus fields which surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand 800 feet (240 m) above the valley floor, and just over 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. There are approximately 300 acres (120 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion...

Explanation: In the given scenario, the process in question is the inhalation of air by the lungs, which involves multiple steps like air expansion, holding the air in lung cells, extracting oxygen, and exhaling bad air. If there is no air available to breathe, then the very first step of the process - expanding to take the air in - cannot occur. This directly impacts the first step, as well as all subsequent steps, as they rely on the presence of air.

Question: \\"If a government is not considered just, what might it be?\\" Context: \\"If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage from corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred with the neologism kleptocracy. Members of the government can take advantage of the natural resources (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid, which is often spent on showy buildings and armaments.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"If a government is not considered just, it can be referred to as a kleptocracy, autocracy, plutocracy, or oligarchy, depending on the specific features it exhibits. These terms, while distinct, can overlap in certain cases, and may often share common characteristics, such as corruption, repression, and a lack of regard for the welfare of citizens. 1. Kleptocracy: As mentioned in the question, a kleptocratic government is one in which the ruling class enriches itself through corruption and embezzlement of public funds, often at the expense of the nation's welfare. Such governments prioritize their own interests and accumulation of wealth, suppressing dissent and exploiting both natural resources and foreign aid. Kleptocracies frequently have rampant corruption, with members of the government taking bribes or engaging in other illegal activities to maintain power and wealth. 2. Autocracy: An autocratic government is one in which a single person, such as a dictator or a despot, holds absolute and unaccountable power over all aspects of the state. This type of government often suppresses opposition, imposes strict control over the media, and has little to no separation of powers or democratic processes. While not every autocratic regime is necessarily characterized by large-scale corruption, the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals often leads to a lack of transparency, creating an environment in which corruption can thrive. 3. Plutocracy: A plutocracy is a government controlled by the wealthy, either through direct rule or by influencing or manipulating political processes. In this system, wealth serves as the primary determinant of power, often resulting in policies that disproportionately benefit the rich at the expense of the broader population. These governments may manipulate the electoral system, use their wealth to buy favorable media coverage, or engage in other activities that promote their interests while marginalizing the needs of the majority. The concentration of wealth and power in a plutocracy can contribute to corruption, as the wealthy may use their influence to avoid prosecution or accountability for their actions. 4. Oligarchy: Similar to a plutocracy, an oligarchy is a form of government in which a small group of individuals—typically drawn from a specific class, such as business elites or military officers—holds significant power. This type of government often lacks transparency and accountability, as those in power rule in their own interests and may be prone to corruption or exploitation of public resources. Oligarchies can suppress dissent in order to maintain their rule, resulting in a lack of political freedom and limited opportunities for the broader population to participate in the political process. In summary, a government that is not considered just might be a kleptocracy, autocracy, plutocracy, or oligarchy. Each of these terms highlights specific features of an unjust government, often characterized by corruption, suppression of dissent, and a lack of accountability. Such governments prioritize their own interests above those of the citizens they are meant to serve, resulting in social, economic, and political inequalities that may ultimately hinder the nation's progress and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was excerpted from Fast Girl: A Life Spent Running from Madness by Suzy Favor Hamilton with Sarah Tomlinson. Copyright © 2015 by Suzy Favor Hamilton. To be published on Sept. 14 by Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. I was shaking, still riding the rush. The appointment I’d just left was one of the fanciest hotel suites in Las Vegas. My body was still glowing with pleasure. This is way better than winning a race, I thought. This is better than competing in the Olympics. If I’d known how amazing this felt, I never would have wasted all that time. My old life with my parents and husband and daughter still waited for me in Wisconsin, but I went home less and less. I was Kelly now, one of the most sought-after escorts in Vegas. Suzy, the former professional athlete, the Realtor, the wife, the mom—she had disappeared. I flashed back to the luxurious penthouse suite where I’d spent the past two hours. It had been my first appointment with this handsome client, but I’d walked in and given him a kiss straightaway, letting my mouth linger on his. I wanted him to imagine I’d been aching to see him all day. I’d taken him to the bed, showing him that I was the one in charge. He’d liked it. Ceding control turned him on, in contrast to his daily life as the CEO of a major corporation. I had earned 1,200 doing something I loved. I thought of my next appointment, later that night. By then I’d be buzzing even more, telegraphing that I was the kind of wild girl who could make his dreams come true. Now that I’d devoted myself to sex, my need to be unsurpassed in the bedroom had replaced the need to be best on the track. But this was even better, because I’d hated the competition necessary to win a race. Everything about being an escort was enjoyable. I didn’t want to go back to my old life. Not ever. Brian Lowe for Sports Illustrated ***** As a child, I had a very active imagination, which made it nearly impossible for me to concentrate on reading or school. I had to be moving. If I was still, anxiety and self-doubt crept into my head. My family—my parents, older brother, two older sisters and I—lived near a small ski hill in Stevens Point, Wis. My brother, Dan, raced competitively. He loved the speed and the adrenaline rush, and he chased the thrill of dangerous activities. The older he got, the more erratic his behavior became. When Dan’s high school girlfriend died of a rare condition, Reye’s syndrome, he was devastated. His mood swings and aggressive behavior worsened. He was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given shock treatment and lithium. After the treatment he self-medicated with liquor. One day when I was 12 and he was 18, my mom and I found him passed out, clutching an empty vodka bottle. Another time my dad found Dan, drunk, pointing a shotgun at his head. No one in my family talked about these anguishing scenes, and a shadow crept over our house. To me, ours was a family of secret pain. I wanted to make up for it. I decided to be perfect. ***** When I discovered running, I loved that it was so pure, just my body and me. By the time I joined my middle school track squad, in seventh grade, I was so much faster than the other girls that our coach had me run with the boys’ team. But I was already faster than most of the boys, too. I didn’t like being singled out like that, and track practice became anxiety-inducing. I wanted to win, but I hated not being able to blend in. The accolades that came with track made my parents proud. I saw that I could distract them from their stress and fears about Dan. But that made me feel more pressure to win. My freshman year at Stevens Point Area Senior High, I won the mile and two-mile races at the statewide meet. I was miserable. I thought, Now I have to win every state meet. If I were to lose, I’d let everyone down. Feeling out of control, I found one thing over which I did have power: what I ate. Or how little I ate. Between the minuscule amount of food I was eating and the excessive training, my body was starving itself. But I was running faster. Still, with all my training, starving myself wasn’t sustainable, so I became bulimic. I would binge on a tray of brownies or a bunch of pasta and then purge. The bulimia was full blown by the time I started college, at Wisconsin, in 1986. No matter how skinny I was, I always felt heavy, especially because I didn’t have what I thought of as the perfect running body. I did everything to hide my large breasts, ordering a team shirt that was too large and altering it to hang even more loosely on me. My shame turned to rage later in my college career when I learned that a coach of the men’s track team had shown his runners video of my breasts bouncing as I ran. In 1993, I would secretly pay 8,000 for breast-reduction surgery. ***** Hamilton (3838) ran poorly in the 800 in Atlanta. Bill Frakes for Sports Illustrated In January of my freshman year a friend fixed me up with one of his baseball teammates, a freshman pitcher from California, Mark Hamilton. He looked like Val Kilmer in Top Gun, with that same flattop. I thought he was gorgeous. Mark was open-minded and wanted to talk about everything. Although he never asked me about my bulimia, he gently urged me to eat when we were together, and he noticed when I’d skip a meal. Eventually I opened up to him. With his support I stopped purging and adopted a more balanced diet. On the track, meanwhile, I worked with Peter Tegen, the greatest coach I would ever have. He knew it was important for his runners to compete against international athletes early to have a shot at the Olympics. He persuaded the university to pay for the team to travel to Europe and race in the summers. There I saw I could hold my own against the world’s best runners. Back in college I won every national track championship I entered—nine in all, at the time the most NCAA titles for any athlete. In January of my senior year I signed a six-figure, five-year contract with Reebok. A week after Mark and I graduated, we got married. We moved from Madison to Malibu. Mark would attend Pepperdine’s law school while I trained for the 1992 Olympics. In the 1,500-meter final at the U.S. trials I edged my childhood idol, Mary Decker Slaney, to finish third and qualify for Barcelona. My parents were overjoyed. Signs went up all over my hometown, cheering me on to the Olympics. The expectations turned my euphoria into the greatest anxiety of my racing life. By the night before my 1,500 preliminary in Barcelona, I was back in the dark, negative head space that often plagued me during competition. Not only that, but the Olympic Village was a chaos of loud music, drunken shouts and laughter. I lay in bed seeing myself fail again and again. I don’t think I slept at all. I would rather have done anything but run an Olympic race. I could barely focus as I took my position. And then I started to run. I didn’t feel like I belonged among these elite athletes. I tightened up with a lap and a half to go, living the nightmare of many runners: I felt as if I were dragging my arms and legs through quicksand. The other racers flew past. I finished last. At the 1996 Games, Suzy ran the 800 meters and failed to make the final. She and Mark moved back to Madison, and she continued to run professionally. Then, in ‘99, Dan Favor died by suicide. ***** The shadow of Dan fell over an already high-stakes year for me. I was 32 in 2000, and it would be my third Olympics. I felt as if I had to finally make good on all the sacrifices that Mark, my parents and my coaches had made for so many years. I came in second in the 1,500 meters at the U.S. trials. I was running great—too great. I peaked in Oslo just after the trials, running the 1,500 in 3:57, a couple of tenths of a second off Slaney’s U.S. record. That established me as the favorite in Sydney. But in the Olympic semifinals I ran second and felt terrible, as if I were already spent. Before the final I wanted to flee. I was assigned to be the first runner, closest to the inside rail. This meant I had to get off to a fast start to avoid getting boxed in. My heart felt as if it would pound itself to dust. When the gun went off, my newly sharpened spikes gripped the track. Running in sheer panic, I pushed my way into [the lead], but with every stride my only thought was, I just want this nightmare to be over. With one lap to go the exhalations of the runners behind me grew louder, making me feel as if I were being hunted like an animal. My legs grew heavy, and with 150 meters left the other runners passed me one by one. I was going to come in last, in my last Olympic race. No gold for Mark, for Coach Tegen, for my parents, for my brother’s memory. Heartbroken, I told myself to fall, and then I fell. I felt like an idiot, but at least I didn’t have to run anymore. Then I realized I couldn’t leave this race unfinished. I made myself get up and cross the line, but when the media crowded around me, I couldn’t bear the shame and collapsed again. I closed my eyes and felt the medics lift me into the air. Suzy and Mark had a daughter, Kylie, in 2005 and began working together in real estate. Suzy suffered from postpartum depression and often felt consumed by anxiety, which placed stress on her marriage. With leaden legs, Hamilton came in last in her 1,500-meter preliminary in Barcelona. Bill Frakes for Sports Illustrated ​ ***** By March 2007, I was barely holding it together. As soon as Mark left for the office in the morning, I fell apart. I rocked back and forth, unable to stop. It’s all too much, I thought. I have this child. I have this job. I hate real estate. I don’t get along with my husband. I want it all to end. Driving home from an appointment with a client one night, I gripped the steering wheel and prepared to drive off the road and into a tree. I was just at the point of no return, pressing the gas pedal hard, when I thought, What if it doesn’t work? I can’t be in a hospital bed for the rest of my life. Kylie’s face kept rising from the chaos in my mind, reminding me that I had something important to live for. I was wrung out by the time I parked in front of the house. I was in a fog that whole night. Mark asked, “What is with you, Suzy?” “Well, I almost killed myself tonight,” I said. Mark immediately softened. He hugged me. “I want you to call the doctor,” he said. “And if you don’t, I’m calling for you.” After Suzy went on antidepressants, she and Mark decided to take a trip to celebrate their 20th anniversary. ***** I said to Mark, “Let’s go to Vegas.” I’d come up with what I considered a wild anniversary celebration. “First, I think we should go skydiving,” I said. “And then”—I paused for drama—”I was thinking, maybe we could hire an escort and have a threesome like we’ve always talked about.” Mark knew I’d always felt some attraction to women, although I’d been only with him. “Yeah ... O.K.,” he said, grinning. I was beside myself with excitement as we pulled up at the airfield. We were doing a tandem jump, which meant we’d each have an instructor strapped to our backs. In the plane we reached our jumping altitude, and in a flash I was falling through the air. Inside, though, I was soaring. It was the most powerful rush possible. I could see all the way to Lake Mead, 30 miles away. It was spectacular. I whooped with joy. I was giddy with endorphins from skydiving when we got back to our hotel room just after six o’clock. At exactly 7 p.m. there was a knock on our door. Our escort, Pearl, strolled in looking happy and relaxed, as if she’d known us forever. She was beautiful; there was a golden glow about her. She sat down close to me on the couch. “Is this your first time in Vegas?” she asked, flirtatiously indicating there was more to that question. “We love Vegas,” I said. “We’ve been here a few times now.” “And what’s the occasion for this trip?” she asked. “It’s our 20th wedding anniversary,” Mark said. “No,” she teased. “You don’t look old enough.” My nerves evaporated. I really liked this woman. She looked at me with real warmth. And then, still holding my gaze, she slowly stood up. “Shall we?” she asked. As Pearl moved things along in the bedroom, she seemed sweet and classy, and I felt myself connecting with her. I also felt closer to Mark than I had in a long time. Suzy returned to Vegas alone several times with the reluctant acquiescence of Mark, who urged her to be discreet. ***** Hamilton returned to Las Vegas many times after her first encounter with an escort. Here she runs in the Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Stiletto Dash. Getty Images file The Rock ‘N’ Roll Marathon asked me to take part in its events in Las Vegas on Dec. 3 and 4, 2011. They flew Mark out as well. I arranged to meet with Bridget, our contact at the high-end escort screening service that had set up our threesome. Pearl had flipped a switch inside me, awakening a certainty that I could please clients even more than she’d pleased me. I told Mark that because the service did a background check on all its clients, becoming an escort was the best way to ensure that no one ever found out about my double life. And I said I had to do this if I was going to be happy. Somehow he agreed. I wanted to have occasional trysts, with just a couple of Bridget’s highest-rolling, most discreet clients. When she asked me why, I said, “Well, I was a professional runner for many years. It could be very damaging to my reputation if anyone found out I was sleeping with a man who wasn’t my husband.” The next day, a few hours before I was due to run the Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon’s first Stiletto Dash, my throwaway phone buzzed. “Can you make an appointment in an hour?” Bridget said. The next thing I knew I was in our hotel room, scrambling to get ready. “Mark, you have to take me to [the client’s hotel],” I said. “I don’t know where it is.” He looked up at me for a long moment, sighed and then explained how to get there. I thanked him and gave him a kiss goodbye. I left my husband of more than 20 years and went to have sex with a stranger for money. I was Kelly now. This was the name I had chosen, but it was more than that. Kelly was my new personality: a confident, powerful woman who made her own decisions. ***** My client on my next trip to Vegas was a good-looking, very wealthy Midwestern corn farmer, Bob, who was in his mid-60s. He had silver-gray hair and a confident, seductive air. “Have you ever been to Denver?” he asked me over drinks. “Oh, sure,” I said. “I’ve been all over the West and Midwest. I went to the University of Wisconsin.” I was too new at escorting to know that the men coveted information about the girls they saw. And I hadn’t yet learned to be careful with my words. I wanted to feel my clients and I were friends; that connection was a huge part of the turn-on. Later that night, without thinking, I referred to myself as Suzy. I hoped he had not caught it. “I want to see you again,” Bob said. I loved the fact that I already had regulars, and I was excited to see Bob on another visit to Vegas. When I walked into his suite, though, he dropped a bombshell. “I know who you are,” he said. “You’re Suzy Favor Hamilton when you’re home in Wisconsin.” Mark had warned me that this would happen, but I wasn’t worried. “I’ll never tell anybody,” Bob said. “Now let’s go get you some new lingerie.” New York Daily News/Getty Having men spend money on me was a thrill. From a young age I’d been told I was destined for greatness, and I had chased that dream on the track. Now, as Kelly, I was looking to be No. 1 again. I became obsessed with the rankings that clients gave escorts on the website Erotic Review. I thought of regulars from whom I could receive 10s, and I went the extra mile for new clients so they would write me positive reviews. Fortunately I had a wonderful husband at home covering for me. He got Kylie up and off to school, devoted himself to our business during a nonstop workday, took Kylie to her after-school activities and made sure she was fed and bathed and tucked into bed. Later, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given a list of common symptoms. None resonated more than this one: increased sex drive. Not only that, but a tendency toward risky sexual behavior with potentially dire consequences. I had started expanding the range of things I was willing to do with clients, but when pushing the sex boundary lost its thrill, I occasionally told them who I was. I loved seeing how excited they got when they learned I was a famous Olympian. I didn’t think it was risky. We had a special bond. None of them would betray me. I was sure of it. In December 2012 the website The Smoking Gun ran a story providing evidence that Kelly was Suzy Favor Hamilton. The next month Suzy was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. ***** Brian Lowe for Sports Illustrated It is a crisp fall morning. I’ve dropped Kylie off at school. I look forward to this time, when I can move in the way my body knows best, wind in my hair, finding the rhythm that feels as natural as breathing. I am constantly in motion: running, on my bike, on my yoga mat. At those times I am myself, living the life I want, not the one that others expect from me or the one that I created out of fantasy. It isn’t perfect, but it’s a life of contentment, and for this I am incredibly grateful. I am grateful for the little moments, such as walking my daughter to school, sharing a family meal, dancing to our favorite songs while we bake chocolate chip cookies. I am grateful that the love of my life stood by me through the destruction that was my illness. The year that followed my diagnosis was actually the most challenging of all. It took months to find the right dosage of Lamictal, the drug that finally quieted my mind. With the help of a skilled mental health team, I identified the triggers that set me off: my job, my family, certain aspects of my marriage. We cleaned up the wreckage I had created and paid the taxes I owed for my escorting. As I run, I feel my muscles loosen. It was running that made me a role model, even though I had little desire for that burden. I came to hate the thing I loved most. But now I have a new purpose. I want to share my story. I want to have the courage to keep fighting. I want to show others, especially my daughter, that you have to live for yourself, and that with love and help you can claw your way back from a dark place. ||||| NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The former middle distance Olympic runner and high-end escort speaks out for the first time about her battle with mental illness, and how mania controlled and compelled her in competition, but also in life. This is a heartbreakingly honest yet hopeful memoir reminiscent of Manic, Electroboy, and An Unquiet Mind. During the 1990s, three-time Olympian Suzy Favor Hamilton was the darling of American track and field. An outstanding runner, a major sports apparel spokesperson, and a happily married wife, she was the model for an active, healthy, and wholesome life. But her perfect facade masked a dark truth: manic depression and bipolar disorder that drove her obsession to perform and win. For years after leaving the track, Suzy wrestled with her condition, as well as the loss of a close friend, conflicted feelings about motherhood and her marriage, and lingering shame about her athletic career. After a misdiagnosis and a recommendation for medication that only exacerbated her mania and made her hypersexual, Suzy embarked on a new path, and assumed a new identity. Fueled by a newfound confidence, a feeling of strength and independence and a desire she couldn’t tamp down, she became a high-priced escort in Las Vegas, working as “Kelly.” But Suzy could not keep her double life a secret forever. When it was eventually exposed, it sent her into a reckless suicidal period where the only option seemed out. Finally, with the help of her devoted husband, Suzy finally got the proper medical help she needed. In this startling frank memoir, she recounts the journey to outrun her demons, revealing how a woman used to physically controlling her body learned to come to terms with her unstable mind. It is the story of a how a supreme competitor scored her most important victory of all—reclaiming her life from the ravages of an untreated mental illness. Today, thanks to diagnosis, therapy, Kelly has stepped into the shadows, but Suzy is building a better life, one day at a time. Sharing her story, Suzy is determined to raise awareness, provide understanding, and offer inspiration to others coping with their own challenges. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Three-time Olympian Suzy Favor Hamilton reveals her secret life as a Las Vegas escort and her struggle with bipolar disorder in her memoir, Fast Girl.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. I am facing a new situation today: John has just started working at a new company. Although he has been in the workforce for many years, this is a new position for him, and he is excited for it. Two weeks after starting, John's branch of the company is hosting a retirement party for one of the longest tenured employees at the office, Brad. Although Brad has enjoyed his time at the company, he says he is excited to be able to take time to himself and relax each day instead of coming into the office. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person will have a faster reflex time? A:","completion":"A: John will have a faster reflex time. Since old age begins in the mid-60s and is characterized by a decline in stamina, strength, reflex time, and senses, it is more likely that John, who has just started working at a new company and is still in the workforce, will have a faster reflex time compared to Brad, who is retiring and most likely older.

Given the two facts above, what is a reason to work with used materials during manufacturing? The answer is:","completion":"Working with used materials during manufacturing is advantageous for numerous reasons, given the two facts provided: 1. Conservation of resources: By utilizing used materials, manufacturers can significantly reduce the demand for raw materials required to create new products. This has a positive impact on the environment, as the extraction, transportation, and processing of natural resources can often cause deforestation, habitat destruction, and pollution. In addition, finite resources, such as metals and fossil fuels, can be preserved for future generations. 2. Energy savings: Recycling and reusing materials utilizes less energy as compared to producing products from virgin materials. The energy consumed in the manufacturing process includes the energy utilized during the production, refinement, and transportation of raw materials. By reusing materials that have already gone through these processes, industries contribute to energy conservation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. 3. Reduced waste: Working with used materials helps manufacturers reduce the amount of waste generated. By recycling and reusing materials in the manufacturing process, there is less need to dispose of valuable resources, thereby minimizing the waste that ultimately ends up in landfills or incinerators. This reduction in waste also slows down the depletion of natural resources. 4. Cost-effectiveness: In many instances, using recycled materials can be more cost-effective for manufacturers than acquiring and processing virgin materials. The reduced costs can be attributed to the savings in energy consumption, transportation, and maintenance of raw material sources. Lower production costs can lead to financial gains and competitive advantages for businesses that use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes. 5. Job creation: The recycling sector often generates more employment opportunities than the traditional waste disposal and raw material extraction industries. By working with used materials during manufacturing, companies may promote job growth and contribute to local economic development. 6. Brand reputation and customer confidence: Many consumers today are consciously making eco-friendly choices and prefer to support businesses that demonstrate environmental stewardship. By incorporating recycled materials in their products, manufacturers can improve their brand reputation and build customer loyalty. In conclusion, working with used materials during manufacturing is an environmentally responsible, cost-effective, and resource-efficient approach that benefits manufacturers, consumers, and the planet. By reusing materials in manufacturing processes, companies can conserve resources, save energy, reduce waste, and ultimately contribute to a sustainable future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Elephant shrews, or jumping shrews, are small insectivorous mammals native to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea, whose traditional common English name comes from a fancied resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and an assumed relationship with the shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. Nonetheless, elephant shrews are not classified with the superficially similar true shrews, but are instead more closely related to elephants and their kin within the newly recognized Afrotheria; the biologist Jonathan Kingdon has proposed they instead be called sengis (singular \\"sengi\\"), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa. - Eutheria (from Greek -, eu- \\"true/good\\" and , thríon \\"beast\\" hence \\"true beasts\\") is one of two mammalian clades with extant members that diverged in the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the Late Jurassic. Except for the Virginia opossum, from North America, which is a metatherian, all post-Miocene mammals indigenous to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America north of Mexico are eutherians. Extant eutherians, their last common ancestor, and all extinct descendants of that ancestor are members of Placentalia. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - In terrestrial zoology, megafauna (Ancient Greek \\"mégalo\\" \\"large\\" + New Latin \\"fauna\\" \\"animal\\") are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are weight over , over , or over a metric ton . This includes many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer, red kangaroo, and humans. - Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. The term \\"ground sloth\\" is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant \\"tree sloths.\\" However, this is a historical convention and should not imply that all extinct sloths were strictly terrestrial in nature. Their most recent survivors lived in the Antilles, where it has been proposed they may have survived until 1550 BCE; however, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of between 2819 and 2660 BCE for the last known occurrence of \\"Megalocnus\\" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,0006,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal. - Placentalia (\\"Placentals\\") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. The placentals are primarily distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother where it is nourished via a placenta, until the live birth of a fully developed offspring occurs. - Sloths are mammals classified in the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs. - The superorder Xenarthra is a group of placental mammals, extant today only in the Americas and represented by anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The origins of the order can be traced as far back as the Paleocene, as early as 59 million years ago in South America. Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They had invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 9 Mya, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres, became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features. - The aardvark (; \\"Orycteropus afer\\") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a \\"least concern\\" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - In common cladistic usage, a monophyletic group is a taxon (group of organisms) which forms a clade, meaning that it consists of an ancestral species and all its descendants. The term is synonymous with the uncommon term holophyly. Monophyletic groups are typically characterized by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies). - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning \\"worm tongue\\") commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with the sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name \\"anteater\\" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidnas, pangolins and some members of the Oecobiidae. - Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates. - Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals endemic to Southern Africa, where their Afrikaans names are gouemolle or kruipmolle (singular \\"gouemol\\" or \\"kruipmol\\"). They comprise the family Chrysochloridae and as such they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles, family Talpidae, and other mole-like families, all of which, to various degrees, they resemble as a result of convergence. - Afrotheria is a clade of mammals, the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in Africa or of African origin: golden moles, elephant shrews (also known as sengis), tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, and several extinct clades. They share few anatomical features but many are partly or entirely African in their distribution. This probably reflects the fact that Africa was an island continent through the early Cenozoic. Because the continent was isolated by water, Laurasian groups such as insectivores, rabbits, carnivorans and ungulates could not become established. Instead, the niches occupied by those groups were filled by tenrecs, hyraxes and elephants that evolved from the ancestral afrothere. This adaptive radiation may have occurred in response to the CretaceousPaleogene mass extinction. - A tenrec is any species of mammal within the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. Tenrecs are widely diverse; as a result of convergent evolution they resemble hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and fossorial environments. Some of these species, including the greater hedgehog tenrec, can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Laurasiatheria is a superorder of placental mammals that originated on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia 99 million years ago. The superorder includes shrews, pangolins, bats, whales, carnivorans, odd-toed and even-toed ungulates, among others. - Ungulates (pronounced ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotami. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving. The term means, roughly, \\"being hoofed\\" or \\"hoofed animal\\". As a descriptive term, \\"ungulate\\" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from jungles, plains and rivers. - Atlantogenata is a proposed clade of mammals containing the cohorts or superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra . These groups originated and radiated in the South American and African continents , presumably in the Cretaceous . Together with Boreoeutheria , they make up Eutheria . The monophyly of this grouping was supported by some genetic evidence . Alternative hypotheses are that Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria combine to form Epitheria ( as generally supported by anatomical and other physiological evidence ) or that Boreoeutheria and Xenarthra combine to form Exafroplacentalia or Notolegia . Updated analysis of transposable element insertions around the time of divergence strongly supports the fourth hypothesis of a near - concomitant origin ( trifurcation ) of the three superorders of mammals . - Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order Cingulata, part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths. The word \\"armadillo\\" means \\"little armoured one\\" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them \\"ytchtli\\" , Nahuatl for \\"turtle-rabbit\\": \\"ytl\\" (turtle) and \\"tchtli\\" (rabbit). The Portuguese word for \\"armadillo\\" is \\"tatu\\" which derives from the Tupi language. Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages. - Boreoeutheria (synonymous with Boreotheria) (Greek: \\"north\\" + \\"good\\" + \\"beast\\") is a clade (magnorder) of placental mammals that is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria (most hoofed mammals, most pawed carnivores, and several other groups) and Euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses, as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to answer 'Yes' if the given word is the longest word (in terms of number of letters) in the given sentence, else answer 'No'. Note that there could be multiple longest words in a sentence as they can have the same length that is the largest across all words in that sentence. Problem:Sentence: 'a couple of giraffes are in a field'. Is 'giraffes' the longest word in the sentence? Solution:","completion":"Yes To come up with the answer, I first understood the problem, which was to identify whether the given word (giraffes) is the longest in the given sentence ('a couple of giraffes are in a field'). Using the definition, I observed that my task was to compare the lengths of the words in the sentence. As there can be multiple longest words of the same length, I had to consider that possibility as well. I started by separating the words in the sentence and counting the number of letters in each word: - a: 1 - couple: 6 - of: 2 - giraffes: 8 - are: 3 - in: 2 - a: 1 - field: 5 I found that 'giraffes' had the highest number of letters, which is 8. There were no other words with the same number of letters. Thus, I concluded that 'giraffes' is the longest word in the sentence and the answer is 'Yes'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\\" She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Ah, Cliven Bundy -- poster boy for the anti-government, rugged-individualist crowd. The Marlboro Man for the conservative fantasy world. Cliven Bundy is so bizarre he leaves late night comedians spluttering. (Just check out one of Jon Stewart's riffs.) His comments about race were so embarrassing that Sean Hannity, who had called Bundy \\"a friend and frequent guest of the show,\\" had to do a \\"protest too much\\" denouncement. Yes, Hannity called Bundy's words \\"beyond repugnant\\" -- but only after first promoting him as a patriot par excellence. Republican office-holders, such as Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had been cheerleading Bundy and his rabble also had to distance themselves, many of them fumbling with their rhetorical pom-poms in the process. Here's the basic background: Bundy is a wealthy Nevada rancher who believes he has \\"beneficial use\\" claim to grazing lands owned by the federal government. Ownership of the land is not a matter of dispute. Bundy has been in and out of protracted court battles for decades, and he's lost every time. In 1993, Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees for using federal Bureau of Land Management land. His fees accumulated to 1 million. Finally, after two courts ruled in the bureau's favor, it moved to seize Bundy's cattle, planning to sell them at auction to pay for the 20 years' worth of grazing fees. On April 5, the bureau brought in armed federal agents and began removing Bundy's cattle. Bundy's son Dave was arrested for refusing to leave. That night, Bundy sent a message: \\"They have my cattle and now they have one of my boys. Range War begins tomorrow.\\" Visions of the Wild West, anyone? Frontier justice? Or not. Bundy's supporters rallied around him, traveling from out of state. That's when the bizarre started. Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff, said, \\"We're actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers.\\" How's that for a jaw-dropper? The standoff lasted a week, until the bureau announced on April 12 that it would return the seized cattle because of its \\"grave concern about the safety of employees and members of the public.\\" Well, not all of them. You see, Bundy based his claim that he did not have to pay the grazing fees because -- well, here are his words: \\"I believe this is a sovereign state of Nevada. And I abide by all Nevada state laws. But I don't recognize the United States government as even existing.\\" You see, Bundy is violating the Constitution of Nevada, and therefore the state's laws. Article 1, Section 2 of that state's constitution reads, in part: \\"...the Paramount Allegiance of every citizen is due to the Federal ...and no power exists in the people of this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith...\\" Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer told Fox News: \\"This is a man who said that he doesn't recognize the authority of the United States of America. That makes him a patriot? I love this country, I love the Constitution, and it is the Constitution that established a government that all of us have to recognize. And for him to reject it was the beginning of all of this. And now what he said today is just the end of this.\\" That's the point. We can disagree about policies and politics, and even whether baseball or football is \\"America's sport.\\" Hopefully we'll again get to a place in our civic discourse where we can be civil and compromise for the common good, to move toward that \\"more perfect Union\\" the Constitution mentions. But denying the very existence of the United States? Still, that's not what had other Republicans and conservative pontificators going, \\"oops.\\" It was Bundy's obscene, racist remarks: \\"And because they [Blacks] were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\\" That's why Republicans are distancing themselves from Bundy. Because Bundy's words destroy their argument that we shouldn't talk about race. Bundy's remarks, following so closely on the Supreme Court's Schuette decision, refute Chief Justice John Roberts' misguided insistence that \\"racism will end when we stop helping minorities\\" and prove Justice Sonia Sotomayor right when she says that the act of ignoring pervasive structural racism is an abdication of judicial responsibility. Thanks to the federal government and men and women of valor who fought for those words written in our Constitution, we can have this debate. And it is that same Constitution that gives even a racist idiot like Bundy freedom to spew his lunacy while riding his horse and waving his American flag, even if some Republicans now pretend they've never heard of the guy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. and a hint : In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Please answer this question : Which group didn't increase the size of their muscles? Answer:","completion":"The Brown group, which participated in running 3 miles a day for three months, did not significantly increase the size of their skeletal muscles in comparison to the Blue group, which underwent weight training for the same period. Although both groups engaged in physical exercises, their respective training programs focused on different outcomes and targeted different muscle groups. The Blue group's weight training program took advantage of resistance training, which specifically targeted the growth and strengthening of skeletal muscles. Resistance training, such as weight lifting, puts stress on skeletal muscles, causing microscopic damage to muscle fibers. As the body repairs these fibers, it adds more protein, resulting in increased muscle size and strength. The Blue group's training program focused on progressing the amount of weight lifted over time, providing a continuous challenge for the skeletal muscles, leading to increased muscle size. In contrast, the Brown group's running program focused primarily on cardiovascular fitness and endurance. Running 3 miles a day over an extended period strengthens the cardiac muscle by promoting a faster contraction rate and a greater capacity for pumping blood. This results in improved heart strength and efficiency. While running does engage the leg muscles and leads to some degree of muscle toning and endurance, it does not generally lead to a significant increase in muscle size. This is because running as a form of aerobic exercise primarily utilizes slow-twitch muscle fibers that are fatigue-resistant but have less potential for significant muscle growth compared to the quick-twitch fibers targeted by weight training exercises. Therefore, the group that did not experience a significant increase in muscle size was the Brown group, who focused their training on running and cardiovascular endurance rather than resistance training for muscle growth. However, it is essential to consider that both activities—weight training and running—provide different yet equally important health benefits and should be included in a well-rounded fitness program."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican Bevin wins Kentucky governor's race Matt Bevin's triumph comes less than 2 years after an embarrassing defeat against Mitch McConnell. Republican Matt Bevin easily won Kentucky’s governorship on Tuesday as the GOP made major inroads in a state that had stubbornly resisted the party at the state level even as it voted reliably Republican in federal contests in recent years. Bevin, a self-funding investment manager, rode a late surge of outside support from national Republicans to defeat Democrat Jack Conway, 53 percent to 44 percent, according to The Associated Press. Bevin will become just the second Republican to inhabit the governor’s mansion in Frankfort in more than four decades. Story Continued Below Polls prior to the vote showed a close race, with most surveys giving Conway, the state's sitting attorney general, a slight advantage. Bevin's victory capped a successful night for Republicans, who picked up four of the six independently elected statewide positions despite going into Tuesday with just one GOP officeholder. Their victories included ousting state Auditor Adam Edelen, who was thought to be Democrats' top pick to challenge GOP Sen. Rand Paul next year. It also marked a stunning political turnaround for Bevin, who has spent 7 million trying to win elected office between this run and his failed 2014 Senate primary against now-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2014, he lost the primary to McConnell by 25 percentage points and was mocked by fellow Republicans as an \\"East Coast Con Man\\" and a supporter of cockfighting. He entered the governor's race just hours before the filing deadline and won a May primary against two more establishment-oriented Republicans by a mere 83 votes. McConnell even took to the Senate floor on Wednesday morning to congratulate his one-time rival. \\"I remember when the Republican nomination was hardly worth having in Kentucky,\\" McConnell said. \\"We used to have to beg people to run. So it says something when we see spirited competition for it, which we had in the primary back in May. The governor-elect and I certainly are no strangers to spirited competition, but we're also conservative Kentuckians happy to see some change coming to Frankfort.\\" The general election was ugly, with both candidates repeatedly impugning the other’s integrity and Conway repeatedly blitzing Bevin with negative ads branding the eventual victor as a hypocrite and a liar. Bevin was outspent for most of the contest and had his tactics consistently questioned by his fellow Republicans. But a late 2.5 million spending blitz from the Republican Governors Association helped Bevin close the gap in television advertising in the final weeks. \\"We need a fresh start. We truly do,\\" Bevin said in his victory speech. \\"We've run this race our way. We have not chosen to go into the trough. We've taken the proverbial high road.\\" Bevin, who has often clashed with the party establishment in the state, said he was happy Republicans swept into state offices, but noted he was even \\"more grateful tonight was such a good night for conservatives in Kentucky.\\" Bevin's win throws into doubt the future of KyNect, the state's Obamacare exchange, and Medicaid expansion in the state. It also means that an expansion of early childhood education — something Conway had made a priority — is unlikely in the near future. The Republican gains continue two distressing Obama-era trends for Democrats. The party will now hold just 17 governorships, down from 29 in 2008. Only one of those governors — Virginia's Terry McAuliffe — hails from the South. (Democrats will have a chance to pick up a governor's mansion in the South on Nov. 21, when Democrat John Bel Edwards faces GOP Sen. David Vitter in Louisiana's gubernatorial race.) The Democratic Governors Association suggested that Conway was not to blame for the loss, chalking it up to an outsider-friendly environment the group dubbed \\"Trump-mania.\\" \\"Attorney General Jack Conway ran a strong campaign focused on the issues that matter to Kentuckians: good schools, good-paying jobs and economic opportunity,\\" DGA Executive Director Elisabeth Pearson said. \\"Unfortunately, he ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider. While Jack Conway came up short tonight, his presence in this race strengthened the issues debate in Kentucky.\\" Jack Conway Kentucky governor concession speech: We 'respect' the result Jack Conway delivers his concession speech after losing the Kentucky governor's race Tuesday. poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201511/3205/1155968404_4596406753001_151104-conway-Still001.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" Despite Bevin's unorthodox, underfunded and oft-criticized campaign — as recently as mid-October, national Republicans were not spending money in the contest — his team insisted throughout the race that its candidate's ideological leanings on everything from abortion rights to Obamacare to school choice were more in line with Kentucky voters and would allow them to survive a huge monetary disadvantage. Even with the late help from the RGA, Democrats outspent Republicans in the contest, 8.75 million to 5.5 million. Bevin refused to spend heavily out of his own pocket in the general election and struggled to build a war chest while dealing with Kentucky's low, 1,000 contribution limits. Even late in the race, when Conway's campaign was airing purely negative ads, Bevin's campaign mostly focused on \\"contrast\\" spots, mixing attacks on Conway with positive biographical information about Bevin, noting he was a \\"Christian conservative\\" who served in the military. They repeatedly said he was an \\"outsider businessman\\" running against Conway, a \\"career politician\\" and insider. \\"Jack Conway is spending millions lying about me. It’s all he’s got,\\" Bevin said in his closing argument ad. \\"That’s because Conway is a career politician who supports Obama’s agenda.\\" The RGA congratulated Bevin on the victory and boasted of its 6 million investment in the race, including 2.5 million on digital, direct mail and television in the contest's final two weeks. \\"Matt Bevin’s election tonight marks a fresh start for Kentucky,\\" Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, chairman of the RGA, said in a statement, adding: \\"Under Bevin’s leadership, Kentucky will prosper with a new direction and enjoy the success that comes from having the leadership of a Republican governor.\\" Bevin, an engaging speaker and retail politician, also spent more time on the stump than the sometimes-awkward, Duke-educated Conway, who focused on fundraising to power his broadcast assault. Conway's political career is now marked by three high-profile losses, first in a 2002 House race, then to Paul in a 2010 Senate race and finally to Bevin. \\"This is not the result we were hoping for, but it is a result we respect,\\" Conway said in his concession speech, before turning to his two young daughters: \\"Daddy's going to be home a lot.\\" While Republicans have dominated the Bluegrass State on the federal level, Bevin's victory was far from guaranteed. The state's last Republican governor, Ernie Fletcher, was tossed out of office in 2007 after one scandal-marred term. Before Fletcher, the last Republican governor had been Louie Nunn, who left office in 1971. The incumbent governor, Steve Beshear, is a Democrat, as is every other statewide officeholder except outgoing Agriculture Commissioner James Comer. Democrats also control one chamber of the state legislature. The Democratic gloom spread down-ballot as well. Edelen, who was widely expected to run for Senate against Paul next year if he won reelection, was defeated by GOP state Rep. Mike Harmon, 52 percent to 48 percent. National Republican strategists had begun to worry about Paul's Senate seat as he mounts simultaneous bids for president and reelection. But a statement from the Kentucky Democratic Party hinted Edelen may return to the political scene. \\"Adam has proven time and again that he is a proven champion for Kentucky’s hardworking families,\\" Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Patrick Hughes said. \\"His record of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse and protecting our tax dollars have set a new standard of excellence for the Auditor’s office. We are confident that he will continue to serve as a strong voice for Kentucky families.\\" Democrats, though, may now turn to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer to challenge Paul following Edelen's defeat. Republicans on Tuesday also picked up the state treasurer's office and held on to the agriculture commissioner spot. Democrats managed to hold onto two statewide offices: Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who lost to McConnell in a 2014 Senate race, narrowly defeated Republican Stephen Knipper. And Andy Beshear, the son of the outgoing governor, won a razor-thin victory in his bid to succeed Conway as attorney general. In other races across the country on Tuesday: — Republicans beat back Democrats' efforts to win control of the Virginia state Senate, keeping the General Assembly in GOP hands to counter McAuliffe. — Ohio voters handily rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. More than 65 percent of voters opposed the measure in early returns. — Republican Gov.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What did Reznor think he should have just written himself? , can you please find it? A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website. Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was \\"currently in a holding state\\" and explained, \\"We [Reznor and Sheridan] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would Neil's Comet be visible or not visible on December 21, 2020? Stargazers across the world wait for 2020 when newly discovered very bright Neil's comet would start to pass through the inner solar system On December 21, 2020. After December 27, 2020 the comet would leave the inner solar system. Like many other enthusiasts Ken bought a telescope for the event. His friend Mike is interested in that event too, but is too busy to buy a telescope. Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Answer:","completion":"Neil's Comet would be visible on December 21, 2020. The paragraph states that the comet would start to pass through the inner solar system on December 21, 2020, and would leave after December 27, 2020. Since a comet's tail and coma become visible when it passes through the inner solar system and is illuminated by the sun, Neil's Comet would be visible during that time.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Dr. Kenneth L. Lay Chairman of the Board Enron Corp. Dear Dr. Lay, We met less than a week ago, on Wednesday 16 May 2001, during the OECD Forum 2001 in Paris. I'm an independent consultant and innovator, with a special interest in energy and new technologies. I have more than ten years experience in research and innovation in economics, business and technology. I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum. After the session, I had a discussion with you. Unfortunately, your time was too short. You gave me your card and asked me to write you. As I told you, I think I can add value to your staff, bring new lines of businesses to Enron and with them, many new clients. And above all, unprecedented profits. I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes. I'm mainly making three proposals to Enron. 1.- Working for Enron as an external consultant. Here, I would rather like to work on assignments, medium or long term, with a preference for the following jobs: risk assessment and/or management, strategic analysis on geopolitical, macroeconomics and societal issues. I think these are important tasks for a company like Enron. The current problems with Enron's Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India stresses the kind of importance I'm mentioning. I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful information and policy recommendations. I've done a job like that recently, on the oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon. As you may already know, this is a 4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the World Bank, and led by three major energy firms: Exxon and Chevron of the USA, and Petronas of Malaysia. I wrote a detailed and long report, which combined public and private sectors' concerns, and also communities' interests. Having operations worldwide, Enron I think needs the type of technical works I've done on that major energy project. I have a good expertise in energy economics. I attend international congresses on that subject, for instance in Boston in January 2000. Since more than five years, as a journalist or as an independent consultant, I have been covering the works and studies of, or participated to workshops and seminar organized by, the IEA (International Energy Association). I know Mr. Robert Priddle, IEA chair, who also attended that energy session during the OECD Forum 2001. I know the work he and his team of experts have been doing. 2.- Being fully employed by Enron. In this respect, I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management departments. In these fields, I've also innovated. I've created among concepts, tools and processes. For instance, the \\"Sensible Guide for Action\\". This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very efficacious. It's main goal is to help decision-makers, in both private and public sectors. The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach to solve technical problems. The SGA is a five-leaf bough. I've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth. This method can be adapted to fit some particular projects. The method is very useful in countries where there's no stocks market, and where capital markets are not sufficiently large. That's the case of underdeveloped countries in general, where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the most in the coming decades. Enron cannot overlook this, or miss the business and profit opportunities in this growth. 3.- The Business of Businesses. Dear Dr Lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best investment Enron has ever made. I'm an independent researcher and entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a multidisciplinary background, both by education and professionally. I'm a graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering (University of Paris) and also in business and economics (Institut d'Etudes Politiques of Paris). In this third proposal I'm bringing to Enron two key inventions I've made, two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. I believe they will interest Enron. These products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. They will create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses. I'm currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products. We will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long time before copycats try to reach us. I've created the products, and nobody knows about them or about their extraordinary markets. I started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it difficult to explain my point. I'm writing you as you asked me, because firstly I believe these products will interest Enron. Secondly I know how these products will boost three types of Enron services: Online Marketplace; Broadband Services; and Energy & Commodities. Plus, these products, and the business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron. Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are these: (i) Their market is global. (ii) They are directly related to consumption and savings. (iii) They're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life insurance. (iv) They concern payment transactions and transmissions (And thanks to information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow). (v) They are both offline and online business (These products will be excellent for Enron e-business). (vi) I want to be and remain a global leader. (vii) The products' growth potential is borderless (viii) There's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference, increasing chances that customers remain faithful to us. (ix) My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors. (x) Enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and unprecedented profits. I'm looking for investors willing to put around 7 million. Given that the revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of 500 million to 1 billion, that initial 7 million is a wise and very profitable investment. If you're interested, I'm ready to present the products and its business scenario to you. The business model is very innovative, unprecedented. These products' market is the whole world. But the first three markets I would like to attack are the UK, Germany and moreover, Japan. Today's news about Japan is rather bad. Economists and many observers see a declining Japan. Me not. They may be right from a pure statistical and macroeconomic viewpoint. But they fail to see deeper. They overlook the other face of Japan. For my part, I see great business opportunities in Japan, today and for the coming decade. Particularly for the financial products I'm proposing. These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan, perfectly fit Japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life insurance structure there. Public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in Japan. In Germany they are trying to reform it. But there's no consensus in the governments (federal and states') or in the Parliaments (federal and states'). Last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der won some parliamentary approval. But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue. In the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. What seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in Germany but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise. An additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. In today's \\"Financial Times\\" (Tuesday 22 May 2001, page 17), Peter Thompson, incoming chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds \\"warned UK workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company\\". He adds that \\"many wold have to work until they were 75 -- 10 years longer than the Generate a subject line for this email.","completion":"Subject: Innovative Business Proposals for Enron: Consultancy, Employment, and Unprecedented Financial Products"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Title: The Whispering Stones Genre: Mystery, Drama, Adventure Plot: In the once-peaceful town of Arcadia, the enigmatic Whispering Stones have been a symbol of solace and power for centuries. These ancient mystic stones, nestled deep within the mountain range surrounding the town, are believed to contain a hidden power that can exonerate one from their sins, crimes, and wrongdoings - thus granting them innocence. As the residents of Arcadia have gone through countless generations, the legend of the Whispering Stones has seamlessly blended into their folklore. Throughout history, the townsfolk witnessed an unexpected cleansing of the accused whenever the stones disappeared mysteriously. These odd events have only strengthened their belief in the stones' miraculous abilities. The protagonist Soraya is a young, free-spirited woman born and raised in Arcadia. Though she possesses immense knowledge about the town's rich history, she secretly doubts the credibility of the stones and dismisses them as mere superstitions. Despite her skepticism, she honors the town's traditions out of respect for her elders. One fateful day, her life takes a turn for the worse when she is falsely accused of a heinous crime. The town's people turn against her, and Soraya is shunned by her neighbors and even her own family. Distraught and filled with despair, she seeks guidance from her late grandmother's journals, which reveal hidden secrets about the Whispering Stones and a long-lost cavern said to contain the stones' true power. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Soraya embarks on a treacherous journey to seek the missing stones and prove her innocence. Along her path, she uncovers ancient relics containing cryptic messages etched by her ancestors and stumbles across challenging enigmas. Through a series of trials and tribulations, she begins to unravel the web of secrets surrounding the stones. Soraya comes to realize the stones aren't her town's only secret when she learns about a hidden underground society. This clandestine group has long manipulated Arcadia and its people, exploiting the Whispering Stones' legend for their gain. They've seized the stones with the intent of controlling the townspeople by deciding who should be cast out or pardoned. As she delves deeper into the town's buried past, Soraya is forced to confront her own demons. With each step she takes on her quest, she struggles to reconcile the faith she'd placed in Arcadia's beliefs and her urge to expose the manipulation and deceit permeating the town's core. In the climax of the story, Soraya bravely confronts the underground society and outwits them using her knowledge of the stones' original resting place. She manages to confiscate the Whispering Stones, using their enigmatic power to clear her name and provide evidence to expose the wrongdoings of the secret society. Despite the validity of the stones' ability to bestow innocence, Soraya is forced to reveal the truth about their origin and the dark history lurking beneath Arcadia's facade. Upon the film's conclusion, Soraya develops into a leader in her community as she sets out to rebuild trust and unity amongst the now-distrustful townsfolk. Arcadia finally accepts the truth about the Whispering Stones and chooses to transition towards a more transparent and egalitarian society. Soraya's journey to find the truth serves as a metaphor for humanity's unrelenting quest for authenticity and courage amid adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905.

Article: BANGKOK — In its most significant prisoner release to date, Myanmar on Friday freed a number of prominent political activists in a step toward meeting the demands of Western nations as they move toward more cooperative relations with the country’s new military-backed civilian government, according to news reports. The releases were part of a presidential pardon for 651 detainees and included Min Ko Naing, a student leader from the 1988 pro-democracy uprising who served two long terms in prison. Television images showed large groups of family members and supporters greeting prisoners as they emerged from detention. The Irrawaddy magazine, a Thailand-based Burmese exile magazine known to have good sources, reported that other notable prisoners released included Htay Kywe, Mya Aye, Nilar Thein and Ko Ko Gyi, all of whom were also leaders of the 1988 protests. It was in 1988 that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, first rose to prominence. The government has engaged her in a dialogue since her release from house arrest in November 2010 and she has announced that she will run for a vacant parliamentary seat in April. The Democratic Voice of Burma, a dissident news organization based in Norway, also reported that former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt was released, along with members of the Karen National Union, a leader of the Shan ethnic group, monks arrested in the August 2007 anti-government protests, former military intelligence officials and various journalists, including five from its own organization. Friday’s release appeared to advance recent steps by the government to move toward national reconciliation and improve relations with the outside world. Since it took office last March, ending nearly 50 years of military rule, the government has held talks with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, approved the registration of her political party and her candidacy in April’s by-election, and suspended plans for a huge Chinese-backed dam that drew strong opposition both from within and outside Myanmar, which was once known as Burma. In another gesture that sought to address the demands of Western nations, the government on Thursday announced a cease-fire with ethnic Karen rebels who have been fighting for autonomy since shortly after the country achieved independence in 1948 from Britain. Should Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi win a seat in the election in April, her party, the National League for Democracy, would enter the new political structure for the first time. A party spokesman said Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi would seek one of 48 seats that became vacant after a parliamentary election in November 2010, mostly when members were appointed to cabinet positions. ||||| Myanmar freed some of its most famous political inmates Friday, sparking jubilation outside prison gates while signaling its readiness to comply with demands of the U.S. and its allies for a lifting of economic sanctions.

(Associated Press) A Myanmar political prisoner waves his hand to his colleagues as he comes out of the Insein prison in Yangon, Myanmar, Friday, Jan. 13, 2012. Myanmar freed many of its prominent political prisoners Friday... (Associated Press) Among those released were prominent political activists, the leaders of brutally repressed democratic uprisings, a former prime minister, ethnic minority leaders, journalists and relatives of the former dictator Ne Win. The releases were part of a presidential pardon for 651 detainees that state radio and television said would take part in \\"nation-building.\\" It was the latest in a flurry of accelerating changes in Myanmar sought by the West, including the recent launching of a dialogue with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Thursday's signing of a cease-fire in a long-running campaign against Karen insurgents. Myanmar likely now feels the ball is the West's court to lift the crippling economic measures. But the United States and allies may take a wait-and-see approach, to see if government truces with various ethnic rebel groups hold, discussions with Suu Kyi move forward and scheduled April elections appear free and fair. \\"I think we are close to the removal of Western sanctions,\\" said Monique Skidmore, a Myanmar expert at the University of Canberra, adding that the U.S. and others might first wait to see Aung San Suu Kyi take a seat in parliament. \\"There's a sense that there's still more to go before the sanctions will be removed.\\" Human Rights Watch called Friday's release \\"a crucial development\\" in promoting human rights in Myanmar but stressed that an unknown number of political prisoners still remain detained. The group called for their release and urged the government to allow international monitors to enter prisons to verify the numbers and whereabouts of those still jailed. Until Friday, as many as 1,500 political prisoners were believed to be behind bars, by some counts, and the exact tally of those released Friday will likely take several days. Suu Kyi's party said it was expecting the release of many of the 600 dissidents it tracks. \\"The release of such a large number of political prisoners demonstrates the government's will to solve political problems through political means,\\" said Win Tin, a senior member of Suu Kyi's party who previously spent 19 years in prison but was released under a 2008 amnesty. Among the high-profile inmates released were Min Ko Naing, a nearly legendary student leader from Myanmar's failed 1988 pro-democracy uprising. Cheers and applause erupted outside the Thayet prison, 545 kilometers (345 miles) north of Yangon, where a huge crowd gathered to see the charismatic activist. Min Ko Naing, leader of the \\"88 Generation Students Group,\\" was serving a 65-year prison sentence. His most recent arrest came in August 2007 along with 14 other student leaders at a protest against fuel price increases that preceded the monk-led Saffron Revolution, which was violently suppressed. Activists arrested after the abortive 2007 Saffron Revolution _ named for the color of the robes worn by the country's Buddhist monks _ were also freed Friday. Among them were Shin Gambira, 32, a militant monk who helped lead the anti-government protests. Family members said that he told them he was in good health. Also freed was ethnic leader Khun Tun Oo, the chairman of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, who was serving a 93-year sentence. He was arrested along with several other Shan leaders in February 2005 and charged with treason. Traditional Shan music blasted from speakers outside Khun Tun Oo's family home in Yangon, where a crowd danced as they awaited his return from prison. The government recently signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement with Shan rebels, among several other pacts to end ethnic fighting. The Shan Herald Agency for News, an online news site close to the rebels, said five or six Shan political prisoners were freed Friday. Jailed former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt also was freed. He was ousted in 2004 after falling out of favor with the junta and convicted a year later of insubordination and corruption and sentenced to 44 years under house arrest. \\"The democratic process is on the right track,\\" the 73-year-old Khin Nyunt told reporters in Yangon, saying he did not plan to return to politics. The United States, members of the European Union and Canada are among nations that have imposed sanctions on Myanmar. The U.S. and Britain have previously said they would remain in place until more political prisoners are released. \\"The United States wants to be a partner with Burma,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during her recent historic visit to Myanmar. \\"We want to work with you as you further democratization, as you release all political prisoners, as you begin the difficult but necessary process of ending the ethnic conflicts that have gone on far too long, as you hold elections that are free, fair, and credible.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Myanmar's government has released a number of prominent political activists, including leaders of the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, as part of a presidential pardon for 651 detainees.

The peace treaty referred to in the statement is the Treaty of Chang'an or the \\"Sino-Tibetan Treaty of 821-822\\". The treaty marked the end of a long-standing conflict between the two neighbors and established peace and stability along their shared borders. The treaty was negotiated between the Chinese Tang Dynasty and the Tibetan Empire, which were two of the most powerful empires at that time in Asia. The negotiations took place in the Chinese capital Chang'an (now known as Xi'an) after both sides realized that the ongoing conflict was becoming detrimental to their respective empires. The Treaty of Chang'an consisted of various articles addressing mutual non-aggression, the return of captured territories, and rules for diplomatic relations and trade. The treaty highlighted the idea of \\"lasting peace\\" and mutual respect between the two empires. An important aspect of the treaty was that it recognized the existence and borders of both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang Dynasty and stipulated that neither empire would attempt to impose its own political or cultural influence on the other. This acknowledgment of the sovereignty and equality of the two empires was crucial in maintaining a peaceful relationship for several decades following the treaty's implementation. The Treaty of Chang'an was inscribed on three stone pillars – one in Chinese, one in Tibetan, and the third in a hybrid script. These stone pillars were erected in the capitals of the respective empires – Chang'an in China, Lhasa in Tibet – and at a border pass between the two nations. The pillar in Lhasa, known as the Doring Chima or Lhasa Treaty Pillar, still stands today as a testament to this historic agreement. The Treaty of 821-822 CE marked a significant milestone in Sino-Tibetan history, leading to a period of relative peace and cooperation between the two nations. While the geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically since the time of the treaty, the legacy of the Treaty of Chang'an continues to shape the historic narrative and ongoing discussions about the complex relationship between China and Tibet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the Wicked Witch of the West is melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy is sent back to her world, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, decides to revive the Wicked Witch and remove her powers by storing them in a magic broom. Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow, and they become the guardians of the broom. Evilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace. Ozzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys.

They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. After the dragons reawaken, humanity resists with military force, including with nuclear weapons in 2010.

Translate to English","completion":"There have been peaceful protests in all parts of the European Union. Throughout the history of the European Union (EU), there have been various instances of peaceful protests in different countries across the region. People in these countries have united to express their opinions, concerns, and demands on a wide range of issues, from politics and social justice to environmental protection and economic reforms. Peaceful protests serve as a manifestation of the democratic values embraced by the European Union. Citizens have the right to assemble, express themselves, and petition the government to address the problems they face. As a result, governments across the European Union try to create an environment that respects these democratic rights, while maintaining order and ensuring safety for all involved. Some notable examples of peaceful protests in the European Union include: 1. The \\"Indignados\\" movement in Spain (2011): This movement, which later inspired the global \\"Occupy\\" movement, saw thousands of people gather in various cities across the country to peacefully demonstrate against economic inequality, political corruption, and the lack of governmental response to the global financial crisis. 2. The \\"Gilets Jaunes\\" (Yellow Vests) protests in France (2018): These protests began as a response to fuel tax increases but expanded into a broader movement against economic inequality and the government's perceived disconnection from the everyday struggles of French citizens. The vast majority of \\"Yellow Vest\\" protests were peaceful, with some instances of violence and vandalism occurring in certain locations. 3. The \\"Fridays for Future\\" climate strikes (2019): Led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and inspired by her example, millions of students around the world, including those from EU countries, participated in peaceful protests calling for stronger government action against climate change. These events saw young people demand that their futures be taken seriously by those in power. 4. The Polish \\"Women's Strike\\" (2020): In response to a controversial ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal that further restricted access to abortion, thousands of people, predominantly women, organized peaceful demonstrations across Poland. These protests aimed to communicate that the decision would have grave consequences for women's reproductive rights, and women's well-being overall. In conclusion, the European Union has experienced a range of peaceful protests throughout its existence, addressing a multitude of issues central to the lives of its citizens. These events have allowed people to express their dissatisfaction, demand change, and hold their governments accountable in a non-violent manner. Peaceful protests are an essential aspect of any democracy, and they showcase the collective power of citizens when they unite in the pursuit of positive change."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election. After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend. At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie.

Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Finding themselves \\"at liberty,\\" Lawrence and Solter in 1909 were able to join the Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP). The company, founded by Carl Laemmle, the owner of a film exchange (who later absorbed IMP into Universal Pictures, which he also founded and also the president), was looking for experienced filmmakers and actors. Needing a star, he lured Lawrence away from Biograph by promising to give her a marquee. First, Laemmle organized a publicity stunt by starting a rumor that Lawrence had been killed by a street car in New York City. Then, after gaining much media attention, he placed ads in the newspapers that announced, \\"We nail a lie\\", and included a photo of Lawrence. The ad declared she is alive and well and making The Broken Oath, a new movie for his IMP Film Company to be directed by Solter. Laemmle had Lawrence make a personal appearance in St. Louis, Missouri in March 1910 with her leading man to show her fans that she was very much alive, making her one of the first performers not already famous in another medium to be identified by name by her studio. Laemmle generated attention by falsely claiming that Lawrence's St. Louis fans were so excited to learn that she had not died that they rushed her in a frenzy and tore her clothes off. Partially due to Laemmle's ingenuity, the \\"star system\\" was born and before long, Florence Lawrence became a household name. However, her fame also proved that the studio executives who had concerns over wage demands soon had their fears proved correct. Laemmle managed to lure William Ranous, one of Vitagraph's best directors, over to IMP. Ranous introduced Laemmle to Lawrence and Solter, and they began to work together. Lawrence and Solter worked for IMP for eleven months, making fifty films. After this, they went on vacation in Europe. When they returned to the United States, they joined a film company headed by Siegmund Lubin, described as the \\"wisest and most democratic film producer in history\\". She once again teamed with Arthur Johnson, and the pair made 48 films together under Lubin's direction. At the time, the film industry was controlled by the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), a trust formed by the major film companies. IMP was not a member of the MPPC, and hence operated outside its distribution system. Theaters found showing IMP films lost the right to screen MPPC films. IMP, therefore, had powerful enemies in the film industry. It managed to survive largely due to Lawrence's popularity.","completion":"This text is about Florence Lawrence, who was also known as Florence Annie Bridgwood.

Does the sentence \\"Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.\\" answer the question \\"Where does informal learning occur?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.\\" does answer the question \\"Where does informal learning occur?\\" The sentence provides a comprehensive overview of the various contexts in which informal learning can take place. However, it is possible to provide an even more detailed answer to offer a better understanding of the concept: Informal learning refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that occurs outside of structured educational and training settings. This type of learning typically takes place naturally, as individuals engage with their environment and interact with others. Informal learning can be both intentional and unintentional, and since it happens in various settings, it plays a critical role in shaping an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities. Here are some contexts where informal learning occurs: 1. At Home: A significant portion of informal learning occurs within the family context. Children learn from their parents and siblings through observation, imitation, and participation in various activities such as cooking, cleaning, gardening, and discussions on different topics. 2. In the Community: Interactions with peers, neighbors, and community members provide valuable learning experiences. These relationships foster socialization, communication, problem-solving, and cultural understanding. 3. At Work: On-the-job learning is an essential aspect of informal learning. Employees learn practical skills, work-related knowledge, professional norms, and organizational culture through their daily interactions with colleagues and supervisors, and by performing their tasks. 4. Through Hobbies and Leisure Activities: Engaging in activities such as sports, arts, travel, or reading exposes individuals to new knowledge and skills, which contribute to their overall development and learning. 5. Media and Technology: In the digital age, informal learning has been enhanced by the availability of various forms of media and technology. Individuals can access information, engage with online communities, and learn new skills through websites, social media, videos, podcasts, blogs, and other online platforms. 6. Volunteering and Community Service: Participation in volunteering and community service activities not only enhances social awareness but also provides opportunities for individuals to learn project management, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. 7. Through Mentoring and Coaching: Informal mentoring relationships can develop between individuals in various contexts, such as work, community, or sports. These relationships provide opportunities for learning through guidance, feedback, and support. 8. Cultural and Spiritual Practices: Individuals can learn about their cultural heritage, values, beliefs, and traditions through participation in cultural and spiritual practices, events, and rituals. It is crucial to recognize the importance of informal learning, as it complements and enriches formal education and training, ultimately contributing to an individual's lifelong learning journey. By being aware of the various contexts in which informal learning occurs, individuals can further seek diverse learning opportunities and experiences that help them grow and develop in both personal and professional aspects of their lives."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

An acceptable answer is consistent with the context in question, detailed, long, and uses general knowledge of English. Answers that are not definite and suggest a variety of options are not acceptable answers. Problem:Question: I once read that JRR Tolkien, a linguist by profession and of The Lord of the Rings fame, wrote his masterpiece using elements of archaic English to emulate the Bible. Following a question on writers.SE, and comments below, this statement is not as clear as I took it. As non-native speaker, I stumbled upon a few words the first time that I read the book (in original version). It is clear that he did use a few words that, IMHO, were deemed archaic already by the time the novel was published in 1954. Most notably amongst them are the use of thou and thee. He also used less common or less modern words (or meanings), as can be seen in this list. It is even the subject of a book. As an illustration \\"Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!\\" A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.\\" A sword rang as it was drawn. \\"Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.\\" \\"Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!\\" Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. \\"But no living man am I!\\" -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings (source) Tolkien is known to have written a story to give life to made-up languages. And I have the feeling he used (somewhat) old(er) English for the speech of the Elves with Men, equally for educational purpose. I understand that one needs to define some terms, in particular \\"archaic\\". I would say that archaic words and/or expressions are words and/or expressions that would be out of place (due to it being too old) in a conversation of the time, and which would be noticed by the participants of the conversation as such. Or hasn't been used commonly for 50-100 years. Now, from the elements above, did Tolkien use archaic elements of language when writing the Lord of the Ring? Or do these words strike me as old because I am non-native and/or they are not so much in use today, but were faily common back then (when he wrote it) at least in University circles where he was. PS. I did hesitate to ask this question in Writers.SE, SciFi.SE, ELL.SE or here. But ultimately as it is about English language as such I thought it was better here. But please to tell me if I should ask it somewhere more appropriate? PPS. I hope I managed to limit the \\"opinion-based\\" part of the question. Answer: The basic answer to your question of whether he used archaic language to emulate the Bible is no, of course not. There is one specific exception, however, which I explain further on. The Lord of the Rings is composed entirely in Modern English using all manner of style and register. This is deliberate. (I will exempt Eomer's \\"Westu Theoden hal!\\" taken directly from Beowulf's \\"Ws u, Hrogar, hal\\", as that actually is Old English. Nothing else is.) Tolkien himself specifically explains exactly why he resorts to the second-person singular in certain situations. Please read Appendix F, section II, \\"On Translation\\" for this and a great deal more about what he was doing, and why, when he attributed different styles of speech to different characters at different times. The Witch-king's use of the second person was intended to be belittling. In Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman, while attempting to present a summary of the book's plot and character, Tolkien states that: . . . even in style it is to include the colloquialism and vulgarity of the Hobbits, poetry and the highest style of prose. So his mixing of low and high, and even of poetry and prose, was done with full awareness and intent. Indeed, in the same Waldman letter he also wrote: Hardly a word in its 600,000 or more has been unconsidered. And the placing, size, style, and contribution to the whole of all the features, incidents, and chapters has been laboriously pondered Perhaps the best explanation for why Tolkien ever used archaic phrasing can be found in his Letter #171, wherein he takes up the accusation of gratuitous \\"tushery\\" (archaism). He addresses the point of why one would use archaic language to represent what was (purported to be) spoken by an archaic people in this way. Dear Hugh, ....Don't be disturbed! I have not noticed any impertinence (or sycophancy) in your letters; and anyone so appreciative and so perceptive is entitled to criticism. Anyway I do not naturally breathe an air of undiluted incense! It was not what you said (last letter but one, not the one that I answered) or your right to say it, that might have called for a reply, if I had the time for it; but the pain that I always feel when anyone in an age in which almost all auctorial manhandling of English is permitted (especially if disruptive) in the name of art or 'personal expression' immediately dismisses out of court deliberate 'archaism'. The proper use of 'tushery' is to apply it to the kind of bogus 'medieval' stuff which attempts (without knowledge) to give a supposed temporal colour with expletives, such as tush, pish, zounds, marry, and the like. But a real archaic English is far more terse than modern; also many of things said could not be said in our slack and often frivolous idiom. Of course, not being specially well read in modern English, and far more familiar with works in the ancient and 'middle' idioms, my own ear is to some extent affected; so that though I could easily recollect how a modern would put this or that, what comes easiest to mind or pen is not quite that. But take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible): Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the King. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' This is a fair example moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that still are used or known to the educated, the King would really have said 'Nay, thou (n')wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. 'Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualties' and then what? Theoden would certainly think, and probably say 'thus shall I sleep better'! But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave', or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke in a modern style would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism of expression on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. Like some non-Christian making a reference to some Christian belief which did not in fact move him at all. Or p.127, as an example of 'archaism' that cannot be defended as 'dramatic', since it is not in dialogue, but the author's description of the arming of the guests which seemed specially to upset you. But such 'heroic' scenes do not occur in a modern setting to which a modern idiom belongs. Why deliberately ignore, refuse to use the wealth of English which leaves us a choice of styles without any possibility of unintelligibility. I can see no more reason for not using the much terser and more vivid ancient style than for changing the obsolete weapons, helms, shields and hauberks into modern uniforms. 'Helms too they chose' is archaic. Some (wrongly) class it as 'inversion', since normal order is 'They also chose helmets' or 'they chose helmets too'. (Real mod. E. 'They also picked out some helmets and round shields.) But this is not normal order, and if mod. E. has lost the trick of putting a word desired to emphasize (for pictorial, emotional or logical reasons) into prominent first place, without addition of a lot of little 'empty' words (as the Chinese say), so much the worse for it. And so much the better for it the sooner it learns the trick again. And some one must begin the teaching, by example. I am sorry to find you so affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion that its usages per se and simply as 'contemporary' irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid (or even nobler!) have some peculiar validity, above those of other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot under the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time! Also (not to be too donnish) learn to discriminate between the bogus and genuine antique as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer! He does not actually write archaic language, or not fully archaic, for he would have lost the reader. What he does do at times is watered or moderated archaism, and he does this for a distinct reason given above. Every linguistic effect he used has a specific purpose that makes good sense in that context. Tolkien was a master of this, and if you think it all archaic, you haven't been reading closely enough. Look at the rustic speech of the hobbits or the coarse speech of the orcs and trolls: all styles and registers are represented in the book, from the low to the very highest. I would say that most uses of archaic language in fantasy literature written today are fake. That's because there is so much of it, and Sturgeon's Law applies. They are the very embodiment of what Tolkien complained of in his letter to Hugh Brogan. He himself doesn't do that because he actually knew what he was writing. Most people do not, and so their would-be antique language comes off sounding bogus, not authentic. About that exception. The one, and I believe only, place where Tolkien deliberately echoed the KJV is in the chapter \\"The Stewart and the King\\" from Book VI. The eagle's song found there is quite obviously cast in the stylized language of the Psalms. I believe Tolkien felt that nothing short of Biblical language could suitably convey the \\"sudden joy as poignant as grief\\" of the unexpected eucatastrophe after all but the wannest of hopes had been forgotten. You really should read Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-Earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, preferably the 2003 edition. Shippey discusses Tolkien's use of language at length. He also shows that all modes of Frye's Anatomy of Criticism are present based on the characters involved, all the way from the mythic to the ironic. Solution:","completion":"yes"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In February 1998, the 40-year-old Saudi exile Usama Bin Laden and a fugitive Egyptian physician, Ayman al Zawahiri, arranged from their Afghan headquarters for an Arabic newspaper in London to publish what they termed a fatwa issued in the name of a \\"World Islamic Front.\\" A fatwa is normally an interpretation of Islamic law by a respected Islamic authority, but neither Bin Laden, Zawahiri, nor the three others who signed this statement were scholars of Islamic law. Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the murder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \\"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV, Bin Laden enlarged on these themes. He claimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels.\\" It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities,\\" he said. Asked whether he approved of terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets.\\" Note: Islamic names often do not follow the Western practice of the consistent use of surnames. Given the variety of names we mention, we chose to refer to individuals by the last word in the names by which they are known: Nawaf al Hazmi as Hazmi, for instance, omitting the article \\"al\\" that would be part of their name in their own societies. We generally make an exception for the more familiar English usage of \\"Bin\\" as part of a last name, as in Bin Laden. Further, there is no universally accepted way to transliterate Arabic words and names into English. We have relied on a mix of common sense, the sound of the name in Arabic, and common usage in source materials, the press, or government documents. When we quote from a source document, we use its transliteration, e.g.,\\"al Qida\\" instead of al Qaeda. Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin Laden's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack. In August 1996, Bin Laden had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What reasons does Bin Laden give for issuing a fatwa on all Americans?\\" is \\"He claimed that America had declared war against God and his messenger\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right! In simple words, Bin Laden issued a fatwa on all Americans because he believed that America had declared war against God and his messenger.

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve agreed Tuesday to raise the amount of capital that big banks must hold to prevent their collapse and reduce the threat they pose to the broader financial system. The higher capital requirements were mandated by Congress in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. They are also in accordance with international standards agreed to after the downturn. Banks had lobbied to modify the requirements on higher capital, saying they could hamper their ability to lend. But experts said most big banks have already increased their capital reserves. ‘‘With these revisions to our capital rules, banking organizations will be better able to withstand periods of financial stress, thus contributing to the overall health of the US economy,’’ said Fed chairman Ben Bernanke. But critics say the rule failed to go far enough and kept taxpayers at risk of having to bail out banks again, should they suffer the kinds of losses incurred during the crisis. ‘‘The rule announced by the Federal Reserve today fails to learn the lesson of the most recent crisis and makes the next crisis — and more bailouts — more likely,’’ said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets Inc., a nonprofit bank watchdog group. Hundreds of US banks received federal bailouts during the financial crisis that struck in 2008 and triggered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The list included the nation’s largest financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. Under the rule, all banks will need to maintain a level of high-quality capital equal to 4.5 percent of their loans and other assets, weighted by how risky those assets are. A Fed staff memo said that banks with more than 10 billion in assets and more than 95 percent of those with less than 10 billion in assets would meet the 4.5 percent capital requirement. There is currently a 4 percent requirement for capital but it is not restricted to just high-quality capital, such as bank stock or retained earnings. The nation’s 19 largest banks with assets of 250 billion or more will have to start meeting the requirements by Jan. 1. All other banks will have to begin meeting the requirements a year later. The rules will be fully phased in by the end of 2018. The final rule dropped a provision from an earlier draft that required banks to hold higher amounts of capital for mortgage loans judged to be risky. The change was made after the housing industry and smaller community banks argued against this rule.

The second sentence claims that \\"the Congress shares veto powers with the Senate.\\" This statement is not entirely accurate, as it seems to misunderstand the structure and functioning of the United States legislative branch. The U.S. legislative branch consists of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Collectively, they are known as Congress. Therefore, stating that \\"Congress shares veto powers with the Senate\\" is inaccurate because the Senate is a part of Congress. Moreover, veto powers are typically not associated directly with Congress in the U.S. political system. Veto powers are primarily held by the President of the United States. Congress can pass a bill, but the President has the authority to veto it. If a bill is vetoed, Congress can override the President's veto by achieving a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers (Senate and House of Representatives). In this sense, Congress has the power to override a presidential veto, but they do not possess direct veto powers like the President. In conclusion, the second sentence is not true if we consider the overall context of the U.S. legislative branch and the separation of powers.

Information: - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . '' - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.

Article: After the first World War, a small group of veterans returned to their village in Britain. Most of them managed to get along fairly well, but one--Francis Blustering, who had been wounded and who never recovered his strength-- was unable to work like others. In time he became very poor. Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. Once, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing. One of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \\"You refuse, then?\\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \\"Yes, I cannot allow it.\\" One by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home. A few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\\" \\"Because I was a thief,\\" Blustering said brokenly. \\"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\\" Question: Francis Blustering lived a poor life because _ .

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872? White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. The answer is:","completion":"In 1872, the most abundant group of people in Brazil were the \\"browns,\\" also known as \\"mulattoes\\" or people of mixed-race background, comprising 38.3% of the population.

The second most abundant group were the \\"whites,\\" or White Brazilians, which made up 38.1% of the population and were mainly descended from the original Portuguese settlers and other European immigrants such as Italians, Spaniards, and Germans. It is important to note that the data available for this period might be problematic due to the lack of reliable information prior to 1872.

Summarize: The data for 2012 shows a marked rise on the 12.7 million cases in 2008. In that time the number of deaths has also increased, from 7.6 million to 8.2 million. The rising burden of cancer is being driven by a rapid shift in lifestyles in the developing world to more closely reflect industrialised countries. Rising rates of smoking and obesity as well as people living longer are contributing to the rise. Lung cancer, which is mainly caused by smoking, was the most common cancer globally, with 1.8 million cases - about 13% of the total. The WHO also described a \\"sharp rise\\" in cases of breast cancer. Both the incidence and mortality have increased since 2008. The disease in now the most common cancer in women in 140 countries. Dr David Forman, from the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, said: \\"Breast cancer is also a leading cause of cancer death in the less developed countries of the world. \\"This is partly because a shift in lifestyles is causing an increase in incidence, and partly because clinical advances to combat the disease are not reaching women living in these regions.\\" The WHO said there was an \\"urgent need\\" for the advances made in detection, diagnoses and treatment of breast cancer to be implemented in developing nations.

No thorns in Synetic’s wordless yet enchanting ‘Sleeping Beauty’ When Irina Tsikurishvili slowly enters as the malevolent witch in Synetic Theater’s new wordless staging of “Sleeping Beauty,” she moves like smoke. The mesmerizing Tsikurishvili is even dressed like smoke, in filmy black layers that practically float around her as the nameless witch — not called Maleficent — infiltrates and darkens this evergreen fairy tale. That’s just one of many stylish elements in Synetic’s quick-moving and largely pretty “Sleeping Beauty.” The fable is reinvented by adapter Nathan Weinberger to give the witch a sympathetic backstory and a son who falls for Sleeping Beauty, here named Briar Rose. But it’s also told with an enchanting sense of magic that should appeal to adults and kids, even though the only thing Disney-like about Paata Tsikurishvili’s production is an underlying faith that in fairy tales, everything can be alive. That certainly goes for Phil Charlwood’s set, which is dominated by a dozen floor-to-ceiling strips of fabric that become everything from wind to fire to ghosts bedeviling the prince. The ghosts are a particularly neat trick, with hidden actors pressing their faces into the fabric. The imprints vanish — poof! — when the prince tries to touch them. Other nifty visuals include shadow play as the witch foretells her curse that the king and queen’s daughter, Briar Rose, will prick her finger on a spindle. The show is launched with the witch, in happier times, blessing her own baby with what seems to be stardust depicted by Riki Kim’s fine projections. The tale is powered by an original score from Synetic’s Konstantine Lortkipanidze, whose electronic soundtrack could be called cinematic or balletic, depending on whether the performers are dancing a pas de deux or impersonating frightened deer as a forest burns. It’s not really a dance show, although Irina Tsikurishvili, doubling as choreographer, does create a swirling romantic encounter for Briar Rose (Eliza Smith) and the prince (Zana Gankhuyag), and although the trio of klutzy fairy godmothers (daffily depicted by Kathy Gordon, Francesca Blume and Emily Whitworth) seem to be elegant dancers in their own minds. It is, of course, a perpetual-motion show, with performers taking cues from a lush and shifting environment that includes Brian Allard’s busy guiding lights. The snappy look even extends to Kendra Rai’s flattering costumes hugging the actors’ bodies or flowing as they move: Note the witch’s wispy black strands, the prince’s floor-length greatcoat and the fetching, fluttering winged outfits for the three fairies trying to keep Briar Rose in line. Smith’s Briar Rose is a young princess just coming into her own; her movements are nimble and fluid, with an elegance that feels fresh, slightly unsteady and exciting. Gankhuyag’s prince is robust but more generically heroic — and generic, unfortunately, is the word for the big Hollywood-style faceoff at the end, with actors flexing and punching the air as the lights and score roar into overdrive. That’s just about the only wrinkle. Irina Tsikurishvili is a sinewy, sinister spellbinder as the witch. The show seems to slow down and expand around her each time she appears. And for most of the evening the rest of “Sleeping Beauty” capers along inventively, an appealing addition to Synetic’s body of work. Sleeping Beauty adapted by Nathan Weinberger. Directed by Paata Tsikurishvili. Fight choreographer, Dallas Tolentino; sound design, Thomas Sowers. With Chanel Smith, Dallas Tolentino, Thomas Beheler and Scott S. Turner. About 90 minutes.

Write an article with the title: \\"Love may be as good as morphine\\"","completion":"Title: Love May Be as Good as Morphine Introduction Love, a powerful yet enigmatic emotion, has had poets, philosophers, and psychologists delving into its mysterious depths for centuries. This profoundest of emotions not only has the potential to change lives and make hearts swoon but also stands unmasked as a potent analgesic. Recent research suggests that love, like morphine, may play an essential role in pain management, turning it into a surprising contender for other more conventional pain treatments available today. The aim of this article is to discuss the neurochemistry and psychology behind love's pain-relieving effects and contemplate the applications of this knowledge in practice. The Science of Love: A Potent Pain Relief Source A growing body of evidence from numerous scientific studies conducted over the years indicates that love holds powerful pain-relief properties. Romantic love, in particular, triggers the release of specific neurotransmitters and hormones, such as oxytocin, dopamine, and endorphins, in the brain which are known to have analgesic effects. Oxytocin, popularly referred to as the \\"love hormone\\" or \\"cuddle hormone,\\" is a neuropeptide released by the hypothalamus and most commonly associated with childbirth and lactation. But its powerful effects transcend maternal and romantic connections. It is known to promote social bonding, trust, and relaxation, and it has been shown to reduce anxiety and pain perception. Oxytocin essentially plays a key role in forming an emotional buffer against stress and pain. Similarly, dopamine, a neurotransmitter often referred to as the \\"feel-good\\" hormone, plays an essential role in our experience of pleasure, motivation, and reward. When you are in romantic love, the brain releases surges of dopamine, making you feel euphoric and motivated. The increased dopamine levels in our brains can have a marked analgesic effect, reducing our perception of pain. Lastly, endorphins, chemicals produced in the brain, function as natural painkillers and are structurally similar to morphine, which is a potent opioid. The release of endorphins can create a sense of well-being and even euphoria, making them an essential component in the brain's natural system for alleviating pain. Love vs. Morphine: Pain Relief Properties Morphine and other opioids are known to provide powerful alleviation from pain and discomfort by binding to and activating opioid receptors in our body. But the downside is their potential to cause addiction, dependence, and harmful side effects. In contrast, the natural, pain-relieving neurochemical cocktail released when we experience love is not overshadowed by such negative consequences. Furthermore, love, unlike morphine, is not restricted to specific physiological processes. It extends beyond the mere alleviation of physical pain and fosters emotional healing and psychological well-being, creating a sense of connection, trust, and emotional resilience that may promote faster recovery from illness, injury, or surgery. Application and Future Prospects In light of this knowledge, healthcare professionals and patients alike might explore the potential of love's therapeutic effects to manage pain. Although it may not replace conventional pain treatment options, incorporating love and nurturing environments into pain management practices could be a valuable adjunct, with little or no side effects. The understanding of love's powerful pain-relieving properties also poses an interesting challenge to therapists, social workers, and psychologists. They might develop methods to harness the emotions and human experiences associated with love, facilitating social bonding, and creating nurturing environments to improve pain management and overall mental well-being. Conclusion Though much remains to be uncovered about this fascinating connection, love's potential as an alternative or added pain relief option cannot be understated, with the tantalizing possibility of benefits that conventional drugs cannot promise. Love, this most mysterious human emotion, might indeed be as good as, if not better than morphine, paving the way for new approaches to pain management and promoting holistic healing through nurturing connections and emotional resilience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Janice spent the weekend at a family party in Moore, Georgia. While she was there, she played with her cousin Justine. The two of them rode tricycles, shared presents, and bought their favorite gum together. Janice's favorite part of the weekend was swimming in the lake with Justine and her dog, Boots. Boots did not like the water at first, but soon was splashing around with them. His favorite thing to do was fetch sticks from the water. They also went on a fast boat around the lake.
