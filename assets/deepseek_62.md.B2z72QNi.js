Step 1: Analyzing the review The reviewer mentions loving special effects, but their overall concern seems to be focused on boredom during the middle portion of the movie. This indicates that there is a negative aspect to the product. Step 2: Considering the positive and negative aspects While the review praises special effects, it does so with a caveat regarding the movie's pacing and entertainment value during a significant portion of its runtime. Step 3: Weighing the elements The negative aspect (boredom for the mid-45 minutes) outweighs the positive aspect (good special effects) and leads to the overall impression being unflattering. Conclusion: I conclude that this review depicts the product in an unflattering light due to the emphasis on boredom during a significant portion of the movie, despite acknowledging good special effects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

Answer the following question. Who first popularised the story of Dr Faustus in England?","completion":"The story of Dr Faustus was first popularised in England by the renowned playwright Christopher Marlowe, who was a contemporary of William Shakespeare. Born in 1564 in Canterbury, England, Marlowe was an influential figure in the Elizabethan era, known for his dramatic works and his exploration of complex human experiences through his characters. Christopher Marlowe adapted the story of Dr Faustus into a play titled \\"The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus,\\" often simply referred to as \\"Doctor Faustus\\" or “Dr. Faustus.” The play was based on the German Faustbuch, which in turn drew from the historical accounts of Johann Georg Faust, a German scholar, alchemist, and magician who lived in the early 16th century. The Faustbuch was translated into English by an anonymous author in 1592 under the title \\"The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor John Faustus.\\" Marlowe's \\"Doctor Faustus\\" was written around 1588-1593, but the exact date of composition remains uncertain. The play became highly popular and influential in its time, and it continues to be performed and studied to this day. It is recognized as one of Marlowe's most significant works and contributed to his posthumous fame as an important figure in English literature. In Marlowe's version of the Faust story, Dr. John Faustus is a learned scholar who becomes dissatisfied with the limits of traditional knowledge. He decides to delve into the realm of forbidden arts, namely necromancy, in order to gain unsurpassed knowledge, power, and pleasure. Faustus makes a deal with the devil, selling his soul in exchange for 24 years of service from a demonic servant named Mephistopheles. Throughout the play, Dr. Faustus becomes increasingly corrupted by his newfound abilities and indulges in various sinful acts, all the while confronted by the moral and theological debates around his decision. The play is particularly famous for its exploration of these themes, as well as for its striking portrayal of the internal and external conflicts that define Faustus's tragic character. As the 24 years come to an end, Dr. Faustus becomes desperate to escape his impending doom. However, despite being presented with opportunities to repent and save his soul, he ultimately succumbs to despair and is dragged to hell by demonic forces in a powerful and much-debated climax. Christopher Marlowe's \\"Doctor Faustus\\" played a crucial role in popularising the story of Dr. Faustus in England, conveying complex themes of ambition, morality, theological debate, and the human condition. The play's impact on the world of theatre and literature over the centuries is a testament to Marlowe's important contribution to early modern English drama and the lasting appeal of the Faustian legend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

He turns to the audience and explains that his wife, Sweetypuss, told him that if he didn't bring home a roast duck for dinner, she would 'cook (his) goose'. (A parody of Wallace Wimple and his wife \\"Sweetie Face\\".) The scene cuts to Daffy eating corn while singing \\"I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" minding his business. A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy's head. Then he jumps and shouts \\"WATCH IT, BUB!!!\\" directly in his face. After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around (\\"You crushed my little head!\\") This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee. Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck. Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps (of sugar) his wife usually gives him. Meek shows Daffy a 'lump' (a bump on his head), and Daffy hits him on the head (giving him another 'lump') and pours cream on it. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing \\"Shortening Bread\\", and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed (\\"Say. That's that Daffy Duck.\\") Daffy then utters 'YOU AIN'T JUST WHISTLING DIXIE!!!', then throws a pie at him, leading into a war between himself and Meek. Daffy goes into army plane mode, by dropping an egg on Meek as a \\"Secret Bomb Site.\\" Next, he goes into battle weaponry mode, by making various sounds and smashing household items. After all the fun and games are over, Meek gets mad, which causes the egg to fry on his head., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"The full name of the person whose wife wants a roast duck for dinner is Mr. Meek. This can be inferred from the text stating, \\"The cartoon begins with Mr. Meek carrying an axe in his hands. He turns to the audience and explains that his wife, Sweetypuss, told him that if he didn't bring home a roast duck for dinner, she would 'cook (his) goose'.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah's Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old. While Dr. Stuart walks around the ruins he falls down through an opening. The rest of the party goes down on ropes to save him. Bentley leads the way, followed by Lafarge, who is much older than the rest. Bellamin is third down the opening followed by Nazar (Rodd Redwing). After dropping down about 200 feet Bentley finds Stuart, but he died in the fall.

This question involves two standalone sentences, \\"Mommy Dearest\\" and \\"Beautiful mama\\", with no logical or factual connection established between them. \\"Mommy Dearest\\" is an affectionate term for a mother. On the other hand, \\"Beautiful mama\\" seems to be another form of endearment, suggesting that the speaker finds the mother to be attractive. However, without additional context or information, we cannot infer the truth of the second sentence from the first one. The truth of \\"Beautiful mama\\" relies on an entirely separate measure - the speaker's perception of the mother's beauty, which is subjective and not necessarily tied to the use of an endearing term like \\"Mommy Dearest\\". Furthermore, the term \\"beautiful\\" can have different interpreters, it can refer to physical attractiveness, but it can also denote admiration for someone's character or qualities.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the linear equation -51*b + 185 = 106*b + 55*b - 27*b for b, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation -51*b is the only term containing b, so it stays. On the right side of the equation, we have three terms containing b: 106*b, 55*b, and -27*b. Combine those terms: 106*b + 55*b - 27*b Add the coefficients: 106 + 55 - 27 = 134 So, the simplified term is: 134*b Now, the equation becomes: -51*b + 185 = 134*b Step 2: Isolate b. To isolate b, move the terms containing b to one side of the equation, and move the constants to the other side. To move -51*b to the right side of the equation, we need to add 51*b to both sides of the equation. The equation becomes: 185 = 134*b + 51*b Combine like terms: 185 = (134 + 51)*b 185 = 185*b Now, divide both sides by 185 to isolate b: b = 185/185 Step 3: Solve for b.

Information: - Atyidae is a family of shrimp, present in all tropical and most temperate waters of the world. Adults of this family are almost always confined to fresh water. This is the only family in the superfamily Atyoidea. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Atya is a genus of freshwater shrimp of the family Atyidae, ranging through the Antilles and along the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Central and South America and in western Africa. It contains the following species: - Atyopsis is a genus of freshwater shrimp from Southeast Asia . It was erected in 1983 by Fenner A. Chace , Jr. for two species formerly treated in the genus Atya . It differs from Atya by various characters , including the form of the telson ( which is longest at the corners in Atyopsis , but not in Atya ) and the presence of a \`\` massive spur '' on the male third pereiopod . The genus comprises two species , Atya spinipes and Atyopsis moluccensis . No fossil representatives are known . They are found on high islands from Sri Lanka to the Samoan Islands , and as far north as Okinawa , as well as on the Asian mainland from the Malay Peninsula to India . The two species differ in the number of teeth on the underside of the rostrum , A. spinipes having 2 -- 6 , while A. moluccensis has 7 -- 16 . When kept in the aquarium this species prefers to have a moderate water flow . This shrimp feeds using its feather like claspers to filter particles from the water . If food is scarce you may find them foraging through the substrate . Like any other crustacean the bamboo shrimp will molt in order to grow . During this process the shrimp is very vulnerable to predation so ample hiding spaces should be provided e.g. small cave structures , dense foliage , etc. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'atyopsis'?

The equation is: 54*g - 83 + 1377 = -1349 - 3 Let's first combine the numbers on both sides of the equation. On the left side: -83 + 1377 = 1294 On the right side: -1349 - 3 = -1352 Now the equation looks like this: 54*g + 1294 = -1352 To solve for 'g', we need to get 'g' by itself. We first need to get rid of the 1294 on the left side. So, we will subtract 1294 from both sides: 54*g + 1294 - 1294 = -1352 - 1294 Now it will look like this: 54*g = -2646 Now, to find 'g', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 54: (54*g) / 54 = -2646 / 54 It simplifies to: g = -49 So the answer is g = -49.

Write highlights for this article: British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has issued a posthumous apology for the \\"appalling\\" treatment of Alan Turing, the British code-breaker who was chemically castrated for being gay. A portrait of Alan Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery's \\"Gay Icons\\" exhibition. The apology came after more than 30,000 people signed an online petition on the UK Government Web site calling for the government to recognize the \\"tragic consequences of prejudice that ended this man's life and career.\\" Turing was just 41 years old when he committed suicide, two years after undergoing a court-ordered chemical castration. He had been found guilty of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship. The punishment in 1952 was either a prison sentence or chemical castration. Turing chose the latter. In a statement on the British Government Web site, Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged Turing's \\"outstanding\\" contribution during World War II. \\"He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war,\\" he wrote, adding, \\"The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely.\\" Turing is considered one of Britain's greatest mathematicians, a genius who is credited with inventing the Bombe, a code-breaking machine that deciphered messages encoded by German Enigma machines during World War II. He went on to develop the Turing machine, a theory that automatic computation cannot solve all mathematical problems, which is considered the basis of modern computing. Last month, the curious lack of public recognition for Turing's contribution to the war effort and computing in general motivated computer programmer John Graham-Cumming to campaign on his behalf. The author of the \\"Geek Atlas,\\" a travel guide for technology enthusiasts, started an online petition, and soon attracted high-profile signatories including scientist Richard Dawkins, actor Stephen Fry, author Ian McEwan and philosopher A.C. Grayling. \\"I was surprised by both the number of people who signed and the fast response from the government,\\" Graham-Cumming told CNN. He said the Prime Minister had called him personally to relay news of the apology. Stories about calls for a British apology were carried in newspapers in France, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, Portugal Poland and the Czech Republic. Supporters set up an international petition which attracted more than 10,000 signatures.","completion":"1.

Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea. But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

The screenplay is for the first major silent motion picture in forty years. At first the studio chief, who is in danger of losing the studio to the New York conglomerate Engulf & Devour, rejects the idea, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood's biggest stars to be in the film, he could save the studio.Funn, Eggs, and Bell proceed to recruit Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minnelli, Anne Bancroft, and Paul Newman (all played by themselves) to be in their silent film in various comic ways. They also ask world famous mime Marcel Marceau (also as himself) to be in the film, but he replies, \\"Non\\", the only spoken word in the entire film. Funn claims not to understand Marceau's reply because he \\"do[es]n't understand French.\\"Meanwhile, Engulf (Harold Gould) and Devour (Ron Carey) worry that Funn will save Big Picture Studios, and they will be unable to buy it.

He was so successful there that he persuaded his employer to buy the New Lanark mill in Scotland. When he arrived at New Lanark it was a dirty little town with a population of 2,000 people. Nobody paid any attention to the workers' houses or their children's education. The conditions in the factories were very bad. There was a lot of crime and the men spent most of their wages on alcoholic drinks. Owen improved the houses. He encouraged people to be clean and save money. He opened a shop and sold the workers cheap, well-made goods to help them. He limited the sale of alcoholic drinks. Above all, he fixed his mind on the children's education. In 1816 he opened the first free primary school in Britain. People came from all over the country to visit Owen's factory. They saw that the workers were healthier and more efficient than in other towns. Their children were better fed and better educated. Owen tried the same experiment in the United States. He bought some land there in 1825, but the community was too far away. He could not keep it under control and lost most of his money. Owen never stopped fighting for his idea.

Organizations, in order to ensure the efficiency and integrity of their operations, have set up specific monitoring mechanisms. These mechanisms are put in place to follow non-mandatory appointments, which are essentially appointments that are not required by any regulation or rule, but can be made based on the preference or convenience of the organization. This can include temporary or provisional appointments that may be subject to review and change in the future. In addition, these monitoring mechanisms also keep track of expired exemption periods. Exemption periods refer to the specified durations in which certain rules, requirements, or obligations are suspended or relaxed for particular reasons. These can include factors such as special circumstances, employee needs, or the needs of the organization itself. Once these exemption periods come to an end, the related rules, requirements, or obligations are reinstated, and the concerned parties must comply with them accordingly. The purpose of having these monitoring mechanisms in place is to maintain a clear record of such appointments and exemptions in the organization. This is important to prevent any potential issues, discrepancies, and confusion that might arise due to lapses in oversight. By consistently monitoring these aspects, organizations can ensure that they operate within the bounds of their established guidelines, policies, and best practices while still allowing for flexibility and adaptability as needed. Having such detailed and long-term oversight also allows organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of their current processes, identify any trends or patterns, and make more informed decisions regarding potential changes or improvements.

Explanation: The paragraph is about the author's feelings regarding her husband being deployed to Afghanistan instead of Iraq and how grateful she is that, in her family's history and memories, Iraq isn't a part of it. Hence it logically follows to continue the unfinished sentence with \\"Iraq baggage in my family\\". - The option \\"Afghanistan baggage in my family\\" is not accurate because the author expresses gratitude that her husband was deployed to Afghanistan. - The options \\"Americans baggage in my family\\", \\"CNN baggage in my family\\", \\"Rebekah Sanderlin baggage in my family\\", and \\"Sanderlin baggage in my family\\" do not make logical sense considering the context of the paragraph. The terms \\"Americans\\", \\"CNN\\" and \\"Rebekah Sanderlin/Sanderlin\\" do not represent conflicts or wars, unlike Iraq and Afghanistan."},{"prompt":"Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

What are the most important words in the following sentence: mist rising on a cold morning","completion":"In the sentence \\"mist rising on a cold morning,\\" the most important words are: 1. Mist: \\"Mist\\" is a natural phenomenon that occurs when tiny water droplets are suspended in the air, creating a thin, hazy veil that reduces visibility. The presence of mist in the sentence evokes a sense of the weather, setting, and atmosphere. 2. Rising: The verb \\"rising\\" implies the upward movement of the mist. This is significant in creating a visual image and understanding the dynamic nature of the scene. The word also suggests the gradual emergence of the mist as the morning progresses, adding an element of time and change to the scenery. 3. Cold: The adjective \\"cold\\" provides essential information about the temperature and the overall feel of the morning. Cold often elicits physical sensations and emotions, such as shivering or the desire to stay warm indoors. Including \\"cold\\" helps paint the picture of a chilly morning, setting the tone for the scene and evoking a specific ambiance. 4. Morning: \\"Morning\\" identifies the time of day and sets the temporal context for the scene. Mornings symbolize beginnings, fresh starts, and often coincide with the sun rising. Incorporating \\"morning\\" into the sentence endows the image with a sense of renewal and awakening. It also gives insight into the natural cycle of the day, as the mist tends to be more prevalent in the early hours, especially on cold mornings. Taken together, these four words – \\"mist,\\" \\"rising,\\" \\"cold,\\" and \\"morning\\" – form the crux of the sentence, capturing the essence of the scene. Each of these words carries significant weight in presenting the reader with a clear, evocative image and successfully communicates the intended atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The memorial service for Justice Antonin Scalia concludes at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Feb. 20, 2016 The memorial service for Justice Antonin Scalia concludes at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post Scalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Scalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Scalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. A Texas sheriff’s department released an incident report late Tuesday that revealed new details of the discovery of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s body, as well as the name of the friend who accompanied him on the hunting trip and the items found inside the ranch bedroom where the justice was found. In response to a public records request made by The Washington Post, the Presidio County Sheriff’s Office released an incident report from the sheriff’s investigation of Scalia’s death at the Cibolo Creek Ranch on Feb. 13. The report stated that the justice’s body was found in bed with a pillowcase covering his eyes. A breathing apparatus was on the table next to the bed, but it was switched off. Scalia was lying on three pillows “stacked up to elevate his head.” [Read the incident report here] Scalia’s sheets and pillows “were still in the creased position from that day’s room service, indicating that there was no struggle involved,” the report said. The top pillowcase “appeared to have shifted at some point in the night due to the weight of his pillow, causing the pillow case to slide down and cover his eyes.” The sheriff noted that the position of the pillow “did not seem to have inhibited Scalia’s breathing.” Antonin Scalia died on Saturday, Feb. 13. Here's a look back on his tenure, his judicial philosophy and the legacy he leaves behind. (Monica Akhtar,Natalie Jennings/The Washington Post) About 12:14 p.m., the owner of the ranch, John Poindexter, called Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez to report the death but would not give him the name of the deceased person. There was then a disagreement between them about who should handle the death report. Poindexter told Dominguez that he wanted to report the death to the U.S. Marshals Service, but Dominguez said that it was under his jurisdiction. “He then stated to me that this death was way beyond my authority and that it should go the Feds (USMS),” Dominguez said in the report. “I then replied it doesn’t matter who it is, it was still under my jurisdiction.” Dominguez called U.S. Marshal Ken Roberts, and they agreed to meet at the ranch, south of Marfa, Tex. The sheriff arrived about 12:35 p.m. When Dominguez arrived, he met Poindexter and Allen Foster, who is described in the report as “a close friend of Scalia” who had flown in with him the day before. C. Allen Foster is a prominent Washington lawyer who has argued before the Supreme Court. It was not immediately clear whether C. Allen Foster was the Scalia friend referred to in the report. A representative from his law firm said that he was traveling and that she would try to reach him. Since Scalia’s death at the remote West Texas ranch, questions have been raised about how the death investigation was handled and why an autopsy wasn’t performed on the 79-year-old Supreme Court justice. The Presidio County judge and the manager of the funeral home that handled Scalia’s body said Scalia’s family insisted on not having an autopsy done. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes and other ailments, according to a letter from his Supreme Court doctor. Presidio County District Attorney Rod Ponton told the Associated Press there was nothing suspicious about Scalia’s death and cited a letter from Rear Adm. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician for members of Congress and the Supreme Court. The Feb. 16 letter said Scalia’s many “significant medical conditions led to his death,” Ponton said. Monahan listed ailments including “sleep apnea, degenerative joint disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high blood pressure,” the AP said. Scalia was also a smoker, the letter said. According to the Presidio County sheriff’s report, Poindexter, Foster and the ranch manager took Dominguez to the room where Scalia died. “All seemed to be in order,” he wrote. Scalia was face-up on the bed, covered with sheets up to his chin. Both of his hands were “resting at his side.” A hose for the breathing machine was found on the left side of Scalia’s bed, but was not attached to him. Scalia’s briefcase was found closed, on a recliner. On the kitchen counter, the sheriff found a “blue stretch band exercise device.” A shaving kit was on the counter in the bathroom. And his shoes were placed next to the bathtub. Scalia’s suitcase was open, and the contents were neatly folded. A shirt was folded on the sofa. On the table to the right of his bed, the sheriff found a flashlight and a pitcher of water with a napkin folded over the top. On a table in the room, there was an “orange cap, a set of keys, a pen, a watch, and a bottle of water.” Poindexter and Foster told the sheriff that Scalia had arrived at the ranch the day before to go hunting. Poindexter has told reporters that about 35 guests were at the ranch for the weekend together. Poindexter told the sheriff that they “had supper and talked for a while” that evening. Scalia “said that he was tired and was going to his room for the night,” the sheriff wrote in his report. ||||| FILE - In this Oct. 18, 2011 file photo, U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia looks into the balcony before addressing the Chicago-Kent College Law justice in Chicago.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Oct. 18, 2011 file photo, U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia looks into the balcony before addressing the Chicago-Kent College Law justice in Chicago. A letter from the Supreme Court's doctor says Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes, among other ailments... (Associated Press) DALLAS (AP) — Antonin Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes, among other ailments that probably contributed to the justice's sudden death, according to a letter from the Supreme Court's doctor. Presidio County District Attorney Rod Ponton cited the letter Tuesday when he told The Associated Press there was nothing suspicious about the Feb. 13 death of the 79-year-old jurist. He said the long list of health problems made an autopsy unnecessary. Ponton had a copy of the letter from Rear Adm. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician for members of Congress and the Supreme Court. The letter was to Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara, who conducted a death inquiry by phone and certified Scalia's death. The letter dated Feb. 16 said Scalia's many \\"significant medical conditions led to his death,\\" Ponton said. In the letter, Monahan listed more than a half-dozen ailments, including sleep apnea, degenerative joint disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high blood pressure. Scalia also was a smoker, the letter said. Ponton declined to provide a copy of the letter, saying an open-records request must be made to Guevara. The AP filed a records request with the judge last week, but she did not provide the letter or respond to a reporter's phone message Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services has declined to release a copy of the death certificate. Scalia was found dead in his bed at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, not far from the Mexico border, where he had gone on a hunting trip. Dr. Mark Hlatky, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University, said a 79-year-old man with those conditions, especially coronary artery disease and sleep apnea, would be at risk for a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia. \\"A lot of people do die in their sleep, and they're found the next day.\\" The conditions are also associated with pulmonary embolism and stroke, which could also \\"kill somebody very suddenly.\\" Scalia's death, he said, was unexpected, \\"but it sounds like it wasn't suspicious.\\" The justice's many ailments, taken together, were \\"quite dangerous,\\" said Dr. David Zich, a physician of internal and emergency medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Zich said he would advise a patient with those conditions who was still smoking to stop smoking first and then lose weight. \\"Those are the main two things someone in his position can do himself,\\" Zich said. \\"The rest falls on the physician to medically manage blood pressure and make sure their blood sugar levels are controlled well.\\" Zich said he would also want such a patient to use a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, at night for sleep apnea \\"to make sure the heart and body aren't stressed while sleeping.\\" A breathing apparatus was found on the night stand next to Scalia's bed when his body was found, but he was not hooked up to it and it was not turned on when he died, according to a Presidio County Sheriff's Office incident report obtained late Tuesday by The Washington Post. Nothing appeared out of place around Scalia's bed, according to the report. Three pillows were stacked to elevate Scalia's head. A top pillow appeared to have toppled onto his eyes and forehead but didn't appear positioned to impede his breathing, the report stated. His arms were at his side atop the bed covers, which were pulled up to his chin. The bed covers were smooth and creased and showed no sign of a struggle, according to the report. His suitcase was open and contained neatly folded clothing. On the kitchen counter rested a blue stretch exercise band. Guevara, who as county judge is the top administrator in the area, previously said she conferred by phone with Sheriff Danny Dominguez and a U.S. marshal before certifying the death. On the day Scalia died, she also conferred with Monahan by phone before determining the cause of death. Scalia's death \\"was handled in a similar fashion as the cases of other elderly people who have died in Presidio County,\\" Ponton said. In rural Texas, justices of the peace investigate deaths, among other duties, but the two justices in the region were out of town and unavailable. Guevara was also out of town, more than 60 miles away, but agreed to conduct the death inquiry by phone. The Supreme Court does not provide regular reports about the justices' health. It is left to each court member to decide how much to make public about medical conditions. Some justices, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have released detailed reports of hospital stays and surgeries. The Supreme Court's press office could find just one release in 29 years pertaining to Scalia's health, a report of surgery in 2003 to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. ___ Associated Press writers Carla K. Johnson in Chicago and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death has been confirmed as due to natural causes, specifically coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes and other related ailments.

Last year after 20 officers were axed from Flint's police force and Detroit's law enforcement budget was cut by 18 per cent. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Rising Crime Rates in Michigan: Flint and Detroit Rank Highest in 2011 FBI Stats Introduction: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released new statistics highlighting the alarming trends in crime rates, particularly murders, in cities across the United States. The findings show that among the worst five cities, a total of 730 murders were reported last year. Notably, Flint and Detroit, both in Michigan, have ranked as the cities with the highest violent crime rates in 2011. Step 1: Discuss the FBI Statistics: The new FBI report paints a grim picture of the murder rates in the United States, with the five worst cities accounting for 730 homicides in a single year. The statistics serve as a stark warning on the severity of the issue and the need for immediate action. Step 2: Highlight Flint's Crime Rate: Flint, Michigan, dubbed as the \\"murder capital\\" of the United States, emerged as the city with the highest violent crime rate in 2011. The drastic increase in crime is not only alarming, but also signals an urgent need for law enforcement authorities to step up their efforts to address this grim situation. Step 3: Discuss Detroit's Ranking: Coming second to Flint, Detroit, Michigan, has also been plagued by a significantly high violent crime rate according to the 2011 FBI report. These statistics prompt an increasing concern for the well-being and safety of the residents in the city. Step 4: Explain the Impact of Budget Cuts on Police Departments: The skyrocketing crime rates in both Flint and Detroit point to a possible correlation with a severe reduction in law enforcement budgets. Last year, Flint witnessed the dismissal of 20 officers from its police force, while Detroit saw its law enforcement budget slashed by 18%. The decreased funding and manpower could have a direct impact on the ability of these cities to respond to, prevent, and investigate violent crimes. Step 5: Emphasize the Need for Solutions and Action: The strikingly high crime rates in Flint and Detroit, along with the budget cuts impacting their respective police departments, highlight the urgent need for action to combat this growing problem. Both cities must prioritize the safety of their residents and work towards finding effective solutions to tackle violent crime. This may involve reevaluating budgets, increasing police presence, and implementing community-based programs that encourage public participation in crime prevention initiatives. Conclusion: The 2011 FBI statistics serve as a sobering reminder of the rampant crime rates in cities like Flint and Detroit in Michigan. It's crucial that both cities and their law enforcement agencies make concerted efforts to protect their residents, invest in public safety, and work together to decrease the prevalence of violent crime in their communities. While the data showcases the enormity of the issue, it also serves as a call to action for all stakeholders to take immediate and decisive steps to address this pressing concern."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" Question: According to Dr. Nass, multitasking _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"can be performed using digital tools\\"? A:","completion":"No, the answer \\"can be performed using digital tools\\" is not what Dr. Nass has indicated in the article. According to Dr. Nass, multitasking is detrimental for attention and memory management. He acknowledges that multitasking may be harmless in some situations, such as doing business in the digital world, but he strongly warns against multitasking when it comes to serious tasks that require significant concentration like writing, thinking, and problem solving. He goes on to suggest that multitasking forces the brain to pause and regroup, akin to pressing the pause button during a movie. He also expresses concerns about the social and emotional health of young people who frequently multitask. While the digital world may facilitate multitasking, Dr. Nass implies it's not beneficial for our cognitive and emotional well-being, and can actually lower our performance even when we seem to think we're doing better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison.

Question: Information: - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Waders are birds commonly found along shorelines and mudflats that wade in order to forage for food (such as insects or crustaceans) in the mud or sand. They are called shorebirds in North America (where \\"wader\\" is used to refer to long-legged wading birds such as storks and herons). Waders are members of the order Charadriiformes, which includes gulls, auks and their allies. - The coursers are a group of birds which together with the pratincoles make up the family Glareolidae. They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they inhabit deserts and similar arid regions. - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families. - Glareolidae is a family of birds in the wader suborder Charadri . It contains two distinct groups , the pratincoles and the coursers . The coursers include the atypical Egyptian plover , Pluvianus aegyptius , which has sometimes been placed in its own family . The family contains 17 species in five genera . - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest. - Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats, are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries. Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud, resulting from deposition of estuarine silts, clays and marine animal detritus. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily. - The Egyptian plover (\\"Pluvianus aegyptius\\"), also known as the crocodile bird, is a wader, the only member of the genus \\"Pluvianus\\". Formerly placed in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae, it is now regarded as the sole member of its own monotypic family Pluvianidae. - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha. - The herons are the long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, some of which are referred to as \\"egrets\\" or \\"bitterns\\" rather than herons. Members of the genera \\"Botaurus\\" and \\"Ixobrychus\\" are referred to as \\"bitterns\\", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus \\"Zebrilus\\", form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks. - An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. - The pratincoles or greywaders are a group of birds which together with the coursers and Egyptian plover make up the family Glareolidae. They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails. - Gulls, often referred to as seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.

CNN poll of polls is an average of seven national surveys taken over the past week. Article:","completion":"Title: CNN Poll of Polls Reveals Continuously High Approval Ratings for President Obama Introduction: Despite leaving office over four years ago, former President Barack Obama still maintains high approval ratings according to a recent CNN poll of polls. The poll, encompassing an average of seven national surveys, reveals that 63 percent of Americans approve of the way the 44th president handled his duties during his tenure. Step 1: Discuss the current approval rating The CNN poll of polls found that 63 percent of Americans approve of President Obama's performance in office. This high approval rating is consistent with the general sentiment of Americans over the years since he left office. Many people still admire his calm and collected demeanor, which was evident throughout his time in the White House. Step 2: Compare the current approval rating with the previous rating In January, the CNN poll of polls placed President Obama's approval rating at an even higher 64 percent. This difference is not significant and still reflects the popularity and satisfaction that many Americans feel towards his handling of presidential duties. It's worth noting that such high ratings are not common among post-presidency assessments. Step 3: Explain the methodology behind the CNN poll of polls The CNN poll of polls is a reliable method to average out the approval ratings, as it takes into account seven national surveys conducted over the past week. This approach minimizes the chances of skewing and ensures that the results are representative of the general public opinion. Step 4: Highlight the factors that contribute to President Obama's high approval ratings There are several factors that continue to contribute to President Obama's high approval ratings even after his tenure has ended. His achievements during his eight years in office, such as the Affordable Care Act, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, and signing the Paris Agreement, all play a significant role in keeping the public's admiration for him intact. In addition to his policy achievements, Obama's charismatic personality, public speaking skills, and ability to connect with people play a considerable part in sustaining his approval ratings. Conclusion: In conclusion, the CNN poll of polls offers a comprehensive snapshot of the lasting approval President Obama continues to hold amongst the American public. His consistently high approval ratings can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including his policy achievements, leadership style, and overall demeanor. As a result, the 44th president serves as a benchmark for future presidents and stands as a symbol of a successful presidency."},{"prompt":"Given the question: \\"Bilocation (film)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.

For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. I am facing a new situation today: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire.

Although the task definition does allow for the word 'no', it doesn't fit contextually in this case because it doesn't make sense for a chuckwalla to have no broad bands across its body. The typical progressive sequence of numbers employed in normal conversations leads me to choose the number immediately after 'four', which is 'five' in English. So, the completed sentence would be \\"Young chuckwallas have four or five broad bands across the body, and three or four on the tail.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lifelong Democrat Jackie Bland is doing something she never thought she'd do: Urge people to vote for a Republican. Bland supports Thad Cochran, a six-term Mississippi senator who's trying to fend off a fierce tea party challenge to his seat from Chris McDaniel as voting got underway in Tuesday's primary runoff. Two weeks ago, Bland helped put up 5,000 pro-Cochran posters in black communities and talk to people about his record. \\"We wanted to raise the awareness to African-Americans that we do have a stake in this runoff election,\\" she said. She pointed to Cochran's efforts to secure federal funds for jobs, Head Start programs and health centers relied upon by African-Americans in the state. \\"We don't want to move backwards,\\" she said. Bland's efforts reflect the high stakes locally and nationally in the Cochran-McDaniel showdown and also illustrate the unscripted political realities of particular states that play out on Election Day. In this case, it's apparent that Cochran needs Democrats to keep his job, and some Democrats heed the fact that Democratic Senate nominee Travis Childers likely won't win in November, so they turn out for a Republican. In Mississippi, neither candidate secured 50% of the vote in the GOP primary this month, requiring a runoff election. And both sides over the past few weeks have relentlessly pursued get-out-the-vote efforts. Unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in Cochran race. Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats can go to the polls so long as they didn't vote in the Democratic primary and they don't plan to support their party candidate in the general election. The question is whether Cochran can shore up enough support to beat back the tea party wave against him. McDaniel got about 1,400 more votes than Cochran in the primary, and national conservative groups have actively rallied around the challenger. Mississippi primary spending spree pushes advertisers off the air. Cochran is pushing his message that his experience makes him more influential in Congress, and his ties on Capitol Hill will better serve Mississippi if he's reelected. McDaniel and allies, however, say Cochran has been in office long enough, and his tenure only breathes more life to the status quo. For his part, McDaniel vows to bring change to the nation's capital and shake things up on Capitol Hill. \\"The people of this country are finally waking up again and recognizing that Washington's been broken for a long time,\\" McDaniel said Monday, referring to tea party victories in recent years. \\"All the sudden you see a great awakening among all the people, particularly those who are very dissatisfied with the direction our country is going.\\" Courting the African-American vote. Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC founded by former Gov. Haley Barbour and his nephew, Henry, has taken the lead in courting votes from Democrats, especially in the African-American community. Cochran's allies are arguing the case that he has long been there for the voting bloc and would better represent their interests than McDaniel. The issue is so complicated that even Bland can hardly stomach what she's doing. She attended an event Monday featuring Republican Sen. John McCain, who called on voters to keep Cochran in Washington but also spent much of his speech blasting President Barack Obama. Bland, a supporter of the President, got up and left. Cochran acknowledged Monday he would likely benefit if a wide range of voters turn out for the runoff. \\"I've always reached out and benefited from support from the black community,\\" he said. \\"My responsibility as a United States senator has been to represent the people of the state of Mississippi, not just one party or one race or a select group of friends.\\" But another Mississippi political veteran labeled the vote courting a risky move. \\"It might get him some votes, but it might lose him some votes,\\" said former Republican Sen. Trent Lott. The ex-Senate majority leader not only served with Cochran for many years, but the two were competitors for the leadership position in 1996. Lott now describes Cochran as \\"a good friend\\" and said he's \\"very nervous\\" about the runoff. It will be \\"difficult for Thad to overcome the momentum\\" by McDaniel, he predicted. Vote underway. Conservative groups are working with Christian Adams, a former Justice Department official, to train volunteers to monitor poll workers and make sure they check to see whether Democrats have already voted in their primary. Some critics question whether the effort might lead to voter intimidation. The Mississippi NAACP dispatched about 250 volunteers to watch poll stations and look for any signs of interference. They're supposed to call the state office if anyone is turned away, but enforcing the crossover primary rule may be hard to enforce. Wayne McDaniels, president the NAACP's Jackson City Branch, said the biggest concern is polling stations in rural areas. \\"There won't be much coverage as far as the news media out there, so those are the pockets where someone might figure they can get away with certain things,\\" he said. McDaniels said the state office hadn't yet receive any calls or suspicious reports from any of the volunteers in the field. CNN saw three people turned away by poll workers in Jackson because they voted in the Democratic primary. Monitoring crossover voters. Adams is overseeing the \\"election integrity project\\" for the conservative groups FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and Senate Conservatives Fund, said Monday in a phone interview that volunteers won't be instructed to talk to voters or poll workers, but only monitor the process at polling stations across the state. \\"These are not negotiators,\\" he told CNN, stressing that they're \\"not activists urging people\\" to vote one way or the other. He said the volunteers will \\"observe what's going on and how to memorialize the events of the day in an observer report,\\" which will be reviewed by lawyers. But he refused to elaborate on who the lawyers are and who they work for. He also declined to be more specific about where exactly the volunteers would be working, saying only that they will be stationed at polling locations \\"across the state.\\" Pressed on why he was providing few details about an effort that seeks transparency and honesty in an election process, Adams didn't give an answer. McDaniel, who chairs the elections committee in the state Senate, said Monday he approves of the monitoring effort and doubts intimidation will become an issue. \\"The issue is to make sure we have a fair process,\\" he said. He argued that a high Democratic turnout for Cochran would reveal the senator's true colors. \\"I'm not concerned about them being African-American. I'm concerned about them being liberal,\\" he told CNN. \\"That's always been my concern. If Senator Cochran is going to court liberal Democrats to save his seat, that's a good indication that he's abandoned conservatism in Mississippi.\\" Learning from last time. Since Cochran failed to defeat McDaniel in the primary, the senator and his campaign have been more aggressive about their ground game. Sources familiar with Cochran's campaign strategy say they hope that a lot of Republicans who stayed home during the primary, thinking Cochran would be fine, will show up at the polls. The senator has had a more active schedule for the runoff and his overall operation is more finely tuned. On Monday, he campaigned with McCain, who reiterated the pitch that an experienced senator is more beneficial for a state. McDaniel doubled down on his attack line against Cochran, saying his partnership with McCain further proves how out of touch the senator is with conservatives. Former Sen. Lott has also helped out Cochran by cutting an ad for his former colleague. He said he didn't do much for Cochran in the primary because \\"I think they didn't think they needed me.\\" But the runoff's been different. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also pitched in for Cochran and produced an ad featuring retired NFL star Brett Favre, a Mississippi native. But Cochran isn't the only one with a celebrity endorsement. Longtime game show host Chuck Woolery headlined a bus tour organized by the Tea Party Express. While Cochran has tried to make the case that his near-four decades in the Senate brings wisdom and power, he's fighting an uphill battle against a younger politician and former talk radio host who paints himself as the candidate more principled and eager to help lead a conservative movement in the Senate. Jeremiah Boddy, 20, a student at the University of Southern Mississippi and a McDaniel supporter, showed up to a Cochran event Monday. \\"I feel like it's the same rhetoric, just washed and put in different clothes,\\" he told CNN. \\"I mean he has no charisma, and as far as I'm concerned, he couldn't sell you a brand new car, even if it was free.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"This article is about a lady named Jackie Bland who is supporting a Republican candidate named Thad Cochran.

Make this proper case","completion":"Backgammon has always been a popular game for players in most parts of the world, and players have been gambling on the outcome of games for ages. This ancient board game, dating back almost 5,000 years, is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) and then spread to Egypt, Persia, Rome, and beyond. It's been a beloved pastime throughout history, enjoyed by players from every societal stratum and across cultures. By the Middle Ages, backgammon had made its way to Europe, where it was promptly banned by the Church, only to gain immense popularity following this period. Backgammon is simple in concept yet offers depth and complexity that have captivated millions. Each player has a collection of 15 \\"checkers\\" which move on a board, according to the roll of two dice. The objective is to be the first to \\"bear off,\\" or remove all your checkers from the board, while hindering your opponent's progress at the same time. There's a balance between strategy and luck, as players plan their moves strategically, yet are also governed by the roll of the dice. Considering the element of chance involved with the dice, it's no surprise that gambling has long been associated with backgammon. During the game, players can choose to 'double' the stakes with the use of a 'doubling cube', taking the game's excitement to new heights. This introduces an additional level of strategy as players need to decide whether or not the game is favorable enough to accept a double or if it is time to concede. Moreover, professional backgammon tournaments around the world often have substantial cash prizes, adding yet another gambling dimension to this already thrilling game. These tournaments test the skills and strategies of players in a highly competitive environment, while also fueling the gambling aspect of the game. In the modern era, backgammon maintains its popularity through online gaming platforms. These platforms have made it easier for fans around the world to not only play the game but also to bet on it. Many online platforms offer opportunities for betting similar to that in a live backgammon match. They have rekindled interest in this ancient game, attracting a new generation of players eager to test their skills and try their luck. In conclusion, backgammon is deeply rooted in our global culture. Despite its age, it continues to intrigue and engage players worldwide and remains a popular choice for those who enjoy games with a balance of luck and strategy. Its association with gambling persists and has even evolved to fit the online sphere. Whether for fun, friendly competition, or the thrill of gambling, backgammon continues to endure as a beloved game across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be.

Here's the math problem we have: 162 - 6631 = -631 * i + 13723 First, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We need to subtract 6631 from 162. 162 - 6631 = -6469 Now our equation looks like this: -6469 = -631 * i + 13723 Next, let's move the 13723 from the right side to the left side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 13723 from both sides: -6469 - 13723 = -631 * i This simplifies to: -20192 = -631 * i Now we just need to find the value of 'i'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -631: -20192 / -631 = i This gives us: 32 = i So the answer to the math problem is: i = 32.

Summarize this article: The warning - by campaigners - comes after inspectors revealed one in four care homes had been found to be failing on safety. For nursing homes, it was even worse - more than one in three. So how do you find the right one? For many, navigating a way around the care system can be incredibly difficult. The first thing you need to do is to find out whether you - or the person on whose behalf you are looking - can get help towards the costs. The local council is in charge of deciding this. You are entitled to ask them for an assessment. Only those with modest means - assets of below £23,250 - are given any help. And even if you are, you may find yourself paying a top-up fee to get the care home of your choice if it costs more than your council is willing to pay. You obviously have more choice if you have to pay for yourself. But the price can be much higher - the average cost of a care home for a self-funder is £618 a week, compared with £486 paid for by councils. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks. TBC pay for their own care You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs. TBC pay for their own care Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there. The move is permanent. Once in a care home, you are unlikely to be coming home. So experts suggest that people explore all the avenues before they take the plunge. There are a variety of options. High-intensity care in your own home for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and eating can avoid the need to move into a care home. Other avenues, which are growing in popularity, include getting live-in carers. There are about 150 shared-lives schemes in the country, two-thirds of which are run by councils. Then there are retirement villages where residents usually buy an apartment on the site, although in some schemes they can part-buy or even rent the property. People can pay for care and support services, which are on-site, as and when they need them. The properties on them have been designed to keep the individual living independently as long as possible and so can be kitted out with alarms, fall sensors and easily accessible showers. Such complexes are popular in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but have yet to completely take off in the UK. There are fewer than 30,000 units in the UK. There are also many different types of sheltered-housing schemes. These have wardens, communal areas and, sometimes, run social events for residents. For those needing more support, extra-care sheltered housing may be available, where residents can have personal care and meals provided. If you do decide to move into a home, there are two choices - a residential care home or nursing home. Latest figures show there are 220,000 nursing home beds, compared with nearly 240,000 care home ones. If you have a medical condition that requires a lot of care, a nursing home could be for you and you may find you are entitled to some NHS funding to cover the costs. Residential care homes do not have to employ nurses, although that does not mean there will be no input from health staff. Community nurses and GPs should both provide support to residents as they would to anyone in their own homes. But it may be worth asking what support there is available. A diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily mean you will get NHS funding, so you might want to check what help can be provided and what training there is for staff for such conditions. It may also be worth considering that you may need nursing support as you get older - some care homes will also have wings with nursing beds. And end-of-life care should also be a consideration - most people die within two years of moving into a home and good palliative care can avoid the need for potentially distressing trips back-and-forth to hospital. One person who has found a great care home is Colin Coulson. He had to move his wife, Dot, 73, into a care home when her dementia worsened. Mr Coulson had been looking after her at home in Kent for five years before she needed to move into residential care. The first home she moved to was not good. \\"It was understaffed, and it just wasn't right for Dot,\\" he says. \\"She had been in hospital, and it was all a bit of a rush to be honest.\\" He quickly decided to look for another - and, with more time, found Brambling House in Dover, which, he says, was \\"lovely, friendly and welcoming\\" from the start. \\"I looked around on the internet. I read the inspection reports and looked at what support they could provide. \\"I then went to visit the home. When we first arrived, we received a lovely, friendly welcome, as if they had known us for years. The other residents looked very happy and content, and the home is laid out to look and feel so homely. \\"My wife was, of course, totally disorientated, but before we left, she had already been given a drink and a bowl of fruit salad. \\"Everywhere we went in the home it was clean and tidy, and the staff we met were polite and made us very welcome. \\"We were told by Sue, the manager, that their home was our home. \\"Now five weeks on, we were completely right. If I had any advice for others I would say, 'Do a bit of research, visit the place and then trust your gut feeling.'\\" A vital source of information is the library inspection reports produced by the Care Quality Commission. These - as well as a guide to which homes are close to you - can be found here. Each provides an overall rating and individual grades for safety, leadership, care, effectiveness and responsiveness. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of care homes, urges people to check them. \\"I ask my staff, when they are inspecting them, to apply the 'Mum test' - are they good enough for their mum or anyone they loved? \\"That has guided our approach to inspections, and so the reports should provided a clear picture about the performance of the care.\\" There are other sources of information too. A browse of the internet will bring up a number of different guides to care homes that can also provide a picture of what to expect. Nothing, of course, actually beats seeing the care home for yourself. Caroline Abraham, of Age UK, says: \\"Really take your time. Have a good walk around, talk to staff, families and managers. They will all provide you with a real insight into what it is like.\\" To help you, Age UK has produced a checklist of things to ask. Some of the suggested questions are: \\"Don't be afraid to ask awkward questions either - the answers will reveal a lot about the home,\\" says Ms Abrahams. Summary:","completion":"Campaigners have warned that finding safe care homes for the elderly is becoming increasingly difficult as one in four care facilities has been reported as failing on safety. For nursing homes, the situation is even worse, with more than one in three found to be failing on safety. Navigating the care system can be complex, with multiple routes available (including care at home, retirement villages, sheltered-housing schemes, and extra-care sheltered housing) depending on individual requirements and means. For those requiring care homes, two primary options are available: residential care home and nursing home. Crucial information in the selection process includes inspection reports from the Care Quality Commission, which can provide details on the overall rating of homes and grades for safety, leadership, care, effectiveness, and responsiveness. Personal visits to the care homes and conversations with staff, families, and managers can also provide valuable insights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the sentence \\"The most powerful constitutional power was imperium.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is considered to be the most authoritative constitutional power?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The most powerful constitutional power was imperium.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What is considered to be the most authoritative constitutional power?\\" However, it is essential to understand the context and background behind 'imperium' to fully appreciate why it was the most authoritative constitutional power. Imperium, in ancient Rome, referred to the supreme executive authority held by certain high-ranking magistrates or officials, which included the power to command armies, administer provinces, and enforce laws. The concept of imperium emerged as a vital and authoritative constitutional power in Roman politics, symbolizing the undeniable strength and control held by the individual wielding it. Originally, imperium was bestowed upon consuls and praetors, the highest-ranking officials in the Roman Republic. Later, during the Roman Empire, the emperor also possessed imperium. The individuals holding this power had great authority and responsibility, including leading the military during warfare, maintaining the peace within provinces, and executing capital punishments when required. Imperium also conferred upon its holder the rights to celebrating a triumph after a successful military campaign and levying troops for wars. Wielding imperium allowed the ruler to create a sense of respect, obedience, and loyalty among the citizens and other officials. Furthermore, this power was not absolute or unrestricted, as overstepping its boundaries or using it for unjust purposes could lead to consequences imposed by the Senate. Various symbols signified imperium, including the fasces, a bundle of wooden rods surrounding an axe that represented strength through unity. The lictors, ceremonial bodyguards, would carry the fasces before a magistrate as a symbol of their authority. Additionally, holders of imperium were granted specific privileges, such as wearing the toga praetexta (a toga with a purple border) and having a curule chair, a kind of ornate folding chair designed for high-ranking individuals. While imperium was an authoritative power, checks and balances existed to prevent its excessive use or abuse. For example, a magistrate possessing imperium could not enter the city of Rome unless they formally relinquished this power, as the city was considered a sacred space where the power to enforce laws was restricted. Additionally, some instances existed in which the imperium of one magistrate could be subjected to the authority of another, known as 'imperium maius,' ensuring cooperation and the balance of power. In conclusion, the statement \\"The most powerful constitutional power was imperium\\" does indeed provide a valid answer to the question about the most authoritative constitutional power. It mainly refers to the context of ancient Rome, where high-ranking officials held imperium, granting them significant authority and responsibility. However, this power was regulated through various checks and balances, ensuring that harmony, stability, and transparency were maintained throughout the political hierarchy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In March 1977, when Simon was still in high school, Simon's father was one of a group of over 140 people held hostage (and later released) in Washington, D.C. by former national secretary of the Nation of Islam Hamaas Abdul Khaalis in the Hanafi Siege. Simon was raised in a Jewish family with roots that originated in Eastern Europe and Hungary (his maternal grandfather had changed his surname from \\"Leibowitz\\" to \\"Ligeti\\"). He has a brother, Gary Simon, and a sister, Linda Evans, who died in 1990. The publishers of Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets were eager for a screen adaptation and submitted it to numerous directors but there was little interest. Simon suggested that they send the book to Baltimore native and film director Barry Levinson. Levinson's assistant Gail Mutrux enjoyed the book and both she and Levinson became attached as producers. The project became the award-winning TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-1999), on which Simon worked as a writer and producer. Simon was asked by Mutrux to write the show's pilot episode but declined, feeling he did not have the necessary expertise. He collaborated with his old college friend David Mills to write the season two premiere \\"Bop Gun\\". The episode was based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana and featured Robin Williams in a guest starring role that garnered the actor an Emmy nomination. Simon and Mills won the WGA Award for Best Writing in a Drama for the episode. Simon also received Austin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award in 2010. Simon left his job with the Baltimore Sun in 1995 to work full-time on Homicide: Life on the Street during the production of the show's fourth season. Simon wrote the teleplay for the season four episodes \\"Justice: Part 2\\" and \\"Scene of the Crime\\" (with Anya Epstein). For season five he was the show's story editor and continued to contribute teleplays writing the episodes \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"Wu's on First?\\" (again with Epstein). He was credited as a producer on the show's sixth and seventh seasons. He wrote the teleplays for parts two and three of the sixth season premiere \\"Blood Ties\\" (the latter marking his third collaboration with Epstein) and provided the story for the later sixth season episodes \\"Full Court Press\\" and \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" (with James Yoshimura). He provided the story for the seventh season episodes \\"Shades of Gray\\" (with Julie Martin), \\"The Same Coin\\" (again with Yoshimura) and \\"Self Defense\\" (with Eric Overmyer). Simon wrote the story and teleplay for the seventh season episodes \\"The Twenty Percent Solution\\" and \\"Sideshow: Part 2\\". Simon, Martin and teleplay writer T. J. English won the Humanitas Prize in the 60 minutes category for the episode \\"Shades of Gray\\". Simon was nominated for a second WGA Award for Best Writing in a Drama for his work on \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" with Yoshimura and Mills (who wrote the teleplay). Simon has said that he thought the show was a \\"remarkable drama\\" but that it did not reflect the book. He has also said that when writing for the show he had to put his experiences of the real detectives aside as the characters became quite different, particularly in their more philosophical approach to the job. Simon said that TV must find shorthand ways of referencing anything real.

During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\"?

Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop. answer the following question: Who asks Dillard to install an alarm system?

When a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague (a variant of bubonic plague), U.S. Public Health Service official Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body. Unfortunately, the stiff got that way by being murdered, and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster. While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling (my reason for bringing the score down to an eight). It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedural, thriller and even romance. This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous. Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already \\"untethered\\" by the studio. Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl. The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan \\"used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well\\". He wanted to exploit the environment. \\"It's so terrific and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints--all of New Orleans\\". Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better. The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods. The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, \\"Quarantine\\" and \\"Some Like 'Em Cold\\". The gangster material, which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan has said that he believes the villains are \\"more colorful--I never had much affection for the good guys anyway. I don't like puritans\\". A close second is the only material that approaches the \\"panic\\" of the title--the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease. While there is plenty of suspense during these two \\"moods\\", much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama, with pacing more typical of that genre. The dialogue throughout is excellent. The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character. Conflict isn't created by \\"dumb\\" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game. When unusual stances are taken, such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue over. In light of this, it's interesting that Kazan believed that \\"propriety, religion, ethics and the middle class are all murdering us\\". That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm, or allowances away from it, made by the protagonists. For example, head gangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered a \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague. The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed, with a slight lean towards positive. The reviewer appreciates the film's performances, intriguing scenario, and well-written dialogue but feels that the film suffers from being slightly unfocused and sprawling across various genres.

The reviewer's overall score for the film is 8 out of 10, indicating a generally positive view but with some reservations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

AJ A:","completion":"Title: \\"Whispers of the Heart\\" Genre: Romantic Drama Synopsis: Claire Thompson, a talented young artist trying to find her place in the world, has always been in love with AJ Simmons, her childhood best friend and the boy next door. As they both start college and venture into adulthood, their bond is tested as they embark on different paths in life. Conflicting emotions, ambitions, and the revelation of a family secret threatens their affection and challenges their future. Act One: Growing up in the idyllic, picturesque town of Fairfield, Claire and AJ had spent most of their lives as inseparable friends. Encouraged by her supportive and loving parents, Claire pursued her passion for painting and writing, while AJ followed his dreams of becoming a musician. While they shared many interests, their polar opposite personalities both complemented and clashed with each other. Claire was an introvert, with a penchant for expressing her emotions through art. AJ, though caring and sensitive, wore his heart on his sleeve and inspired others through his voice and melodies. As their senior year of high school came to an end, the reality of potentially being separated by long distances and conflicting schedules started to sink in. Although Claire had been romantically attracted to AJ since they were teenagers, she could never find it within herself to express her feelings. AJ, on the other hand, remained blissfully unaware of her affections, as he was preoccupied with an on-again, off-again relationship with another high school classmate, Stephanie. Act Two: The tension between Claire and AJ begins to grow as they enter college. While Claire attends a prestigious art school in New York City, AJ enrolls in a renowned music program in Los Angeles. They promise to stay in touch and support each other's dreams, but the challenges of distance and their new environments strain their friendship. Claire's roommate, Emily, who instantly notices Claire's feelings for AJ, becomes her confidante and helps her navigate the complexities of love and friendship. With occasional visits and video calls keeping them connected, Claire starts to find new friends and flourish in her art career, but cannot let go of her love for AJ. Meanwhile, AJ starts gaining recognition as an up-and-coming musician, while his relationship with Stephanie finally ends as she cheats on him. Devastated, AJ finds solace in Claire’s calming words and becomes more aware of the bond they share. Act Three: Claire returns to Fairfield during winter break, where she and AJ rekindle their friendship and grow even closer. Just as Claire finally musters the courage to confess her feelings to him, she stumbles upon a secret that her mother, Grace, had kept hidden for years. Claire learns that AJ is, in fact, her half-brother, a child born from a secret affair between Grace and AJ’s dad, Thomas. Struggling to come to terms with this revelation, Claire's world implodes, but she decides to keep the secret from AJ to protect their families and their friendship. Torn between her love for AJ and the harrowing discovery, Claire starts seeing a therapist and leans on Emily for support. Act Four: As truth has a way of surfacing, the family secret ultimately comes to light, and it shatters the harmony of their lives, leaving both Claire and AJ feeling betrayed and heartbroken. The turmoil of emotions forces them to confront the reality of their newfound relationship and their true feelings for each other. Slowly coming to terms with the painful truth, Claire and AJ, with the help of their friends and family, learn to navigate their new reality. Although the romantic aspect of their love remains forbidden, they find solace in the fact that their connection has only grown stronger. They continue to support each other in their respective careers, believing that their unbreakable bond, despite the odds, whispers of the heart that refuses to be silenced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Six nights a week, The Social Club in downtown Nashville holds parties for couples and singles to dance, flirt and mingle. Sometimes they take the festivities upstairs — to the private beds, the love swings, the group play areas, the “Sybian” room or the dungeon. Yes, people have sex there. “Remember, we are all strangers until we meet!” is a motto at this private swingers group founded in 1980 for consenting adults to explore their sexual fantasies with and around each other. The swingers recently decided they were ready to move to the suburbs. The suburbs do not appear ready for the swingers. When the club purchased a building next to a Christian school, residents protested and threw zoning problems in its way. So the swingers have come up with a new plan to short-circuit the zoning static around their relocation: Their new club, they say, is a church — a church for swingers to meet, to mingle and to engage in the regular practice of their faith. If the city accuses them of running a sham church, the club’s longtime lawyer Larry Roberts says that the Constitution is on their side. Is it? And what defines a “religion,” anyway? The answer to that question is complicated — so complicated, it’s occupied U.S. courts for roughly two centuries now. “They can sue us and say they want an injunction to stop us from operating, and we can say we have some tenets of the church sort of like the Ten Commandments,” Roberts said over the phone. He listed a few. “Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not cheat. Do not commit any act that will be harmful to others. Do not commit adultery without the knowledge and consent of your spouse.” “That one’s a little bit different,” Roberts admitted. How the swingers sex club became a church For years, the swingers have been meeting at a nondescript brick building less than a mile south of Music City Center, in an area that once teemed with adult bookstores and gentleman’s clubs hidden in plain sight. Now the neighborhood is gentrifying quickly. Last fall, the group sold their complex for 1.3 million, more than double what they purchased it for in 1998. They bought an abandoned medical office in a quiet neighborhood north of Nashville called Madison. The 22,000-square-foot space, with private exam rooms that could easily become play rooms, was near perfect — except that it happened to sit between two churches and a posh private Christian academy. “It’s the biggest bunch of bigots that I would into run into except maybe at a Klu Klux Klan meeting,” Roberts said. “When my clients first began considering this, I said, ‘With this location, you’re going to create a firestorm of controversy.’ ” They did. Karen Bennett, who represents this neighborhood on the legislative council for Nashville and Davidson County, said that hundreds of parents — more than 400 by her count — came to each of the public hearings a few months ago. “Madison is a really good, solid, suburban community in Nashville, very family-based,” Bennett said. ”Most people feel like this would be a black eye to have this adult club. It’s not what they want for their community.” Bennett herself graduated from Goodpasture Christian School, which is across the street from the new club building. She’s concerned about having a club so close to a school. Think of the children, she says. “[The swingers] seem to think that they would be quiet neighbors, and I don’t think that’s really the case,” she said. “Kids ask questions and they want to know what is going on.” [This reality show about married swingers is crazy, but not for the reason you think] The neighbors demanded that something be done. “We’re going to pursue that at the highest level legally,” Goodpasture’s president told a local news broadcast in January. “We’re going to pursue it politically. Our goal is for them to never open their doors at 520 Lentz.” That meant that the townspeople were going to change the rules. When the swingers bought the old medical office, they had made sure that it was legal to hold events there. But Bennett soon introduced a new ordinance amending the zoning laws in Nashville and Davidson County. The swingers’ new property would no longer be able to host private clubs of any kind. The Metro Council passed that measure in late March. Soon after, Tennessee’s state legislature also unanimously approved a new law prohibiting private clubs where people can watch or have sex from operating within 1,000 feet of a school. It goes without saying that religious values animate a good deal of the public discourse in Tennessee, where cities are not allowed to have laws protecting gay people from discrimination, and where lawmakers this year sought to make the Bible the state book. Religious institutions are so powerful and protected in America, reasoned the swingers’ lawyer, that if the club couldn’t beat them — well, perhaps it would join them. “What is religion to you may not be to someone else; and what is religion to someone else may not be to you,” Roberts said. According to the club’s new renovation plans, the game room will become the fellowship hall. The north dungeon will be the choir room. The south dungeon will be the handbell room. There won’t be any sex at this church, Roberts said, but people could gather here, and take the party off-premises. “It may not be what they call a ‘full service’ club, but I think it will fulfill the function,” he said. Once the operation is up and running, the city might send inspectors to verify that it is acting as a church. It might issue a warrant asking the courts to adjudicate. (In practice, Nashville zoning administrator Bill Herbert said he’s never heard of a case involving “un-traditional types of churches.”) Roberts said he was the one who counseled the swingers to become a church. He believed that they needed the strong protections and freedoms that the government affords to religious groups. “It’s something that the government can’t control,” he said. “After all, isn’t that the reason America was established, or one of them?” A judge can’t divine which gods are real or false … The First Amendment says that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” But the Constitution is completely silent on the more fundamental question of what religion actually is. And centuries of legal debate haven’t resolved matters much. “Courts struggle with this,” said Alan Brownstein, a law professor at UC Davis. “We do not have an accepted working definition of religion in American legal jurisprudence.” It’s paradoxical, almost. How can a nation so concerned with religious freedom not agree on what constitutes a religion? How can we attach so many protections and privileges to something so legally amorphous? But religious liberty also implies religious diversity, and religious tolerance. The nation, indeed, was founded in part by refugees of a minority sect. In that spirit, the courts have been incredibly reluctant to rule on whether someone’s religion or religious beliefs are the real deal. “We’re worried that if we define religion too narrowly, we’ll end up excluding some belief systems that do deserve to be recognized,” Brownstein said. “It’s very hard to come up with a good definition of religion that includes everything we want to be covered and only excludes what we thinks should be excluded.” On occasions when courts have been forced to render judgement, they often defer to what a person says their religious beliefs are, even if those beliefs are out of the mainstream or idiosyncratic. “[R]eligious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger famously wrote in the majority opinion for Thomas v. Review Board in 1981. [Eugene Volokh explains how the Hobby Lobby decision relied on Thomas v. Review Board] Eddie Thomas was a metal worker and a devout Jehovah’s Witness. In a job application for the Blaw-Knox Foundry and Machinery Co., he listed his hobbies as “Bible study” and “Bible reading.” A year after he joined, the company moved him to a position making tank turrets. Thomas felt this was against his religion. He quit and fought the state of Indiana for unemployment benefits. Thomas’s case, which ended up at the Supreme Court, hinged on whether his beliefs about pacifism were truly religious in nature. Thomas had struggled to define some of the moral principles of his religion. He admitted in court that his friend, also a Jehovah’s Witness, disagreed that their religion prohibited his employment in the tank turret department. In light of these contradictions, the lower court argued that Thomas’s views were a “personal philosophical choice,” lacking sufficient religious character. The Supreme Court brushed aside those concerns. “Courts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation,” Burger wrote, setting a precedent that the legal system would gingerly handle questions of religious validity. So, for instance, the courts have recognized Wiccan covens (there is even one in Memphis); they have ruled in favor of a Santeria group that wanted to sacrifice animals. In the course of its work, the Internal Revenue Service also has to determine whether religions are valid or not. The IRS gives tax exemptions to churches in part because churches tend to serve the public good through education and charity work. To evaluate a church, it considers a range of criteria: whether the church has a creed, religious services, ordained ministers, religious literature and so forth. But these are just guidelines, and religious groups will sue if they think they were unfairly snubbed. The Church of Scientology, for instance, battled the IRS for years to gain tax-exempt status. In one famous lawsuit, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Scientology did not deserve tax breaks because it seemed to be organized like a business funneling profits to its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This violated an IRS rule that says nonprofits need to have some kind of charitable or public service purpose. That case avoided the much tougher question of whether Scientology was actually a religion — a question that the courts feel ill-equipped to answer. In the end, the matter was not decided in court anyway. As the famous story goes, Scientologists pressured the IRS to the point that it finally changed its mind. … but can the courts peer into your soul? And yet, it is also clearly unreasonable for anyone to be able to create a religion or claim newfound religious beliefs just to get special treatment. While courts tend to avoid rendering judgment on anyone’s religion, they are more comfortable ruling on whether someone holds their religious beliefs sincerely. This is the way that many religion-of-convenience lawsuits are decided, explains James Oleske, a law professor at Lewis and Clark. “In general, courts are very reluctant to question the validity of religious beliefs,” he said. “But they do ask if there really is a good-faith, religious belief that exists — that this isn’t a sham in order for people to get immunity for their secular practices.” [Supreme Court rules in favor of Arkansas Muslim inmate’s request to grow beard] There are several examples of courts denying people religious privileges by calling into question whether they actually believe what they say they believe. For instance, Oleske points to a 2010 New Mexico case involving a couple that created a church around sacrament of marijuana. Citing these religious beliefs, in conjunction with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Danuel and Mary Quaintance attempted to defend against criminal marijuana charges. The Tenth Circuit found theirs to be a flimsy argument. People testified that the Quaintances talked about their marijuana operation as a “business” not as a church. “[T]he record contains additional, overwhelming contrary evidence that the Quaintances were running a commercial marijuana business with a religious front,” judge Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 2010 decision. At this point, marijuana church arguments are known to be long shots. “We get these fraternities that call us up,” said Eric Rassbach, a lawyer at the Beckett Fund, a religious liberty defense organization. “Some group of guys on a college campus call us up and say: ‘We just invented this new church. Its sacrament is marijuana. Will you defend us?’ ” “We tell them no, sorry guys, you’re not the first to come up with this idea and you’re going to lose,” Rassbach said. (Sometimes, though it is rare, such an argument does win. Oleske notes that in 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals allowed a Rastafarian to keep his marijuana pipe because it had religious significance to him. The pipe reminded him to “perform what needs to be performed, which is smoking.”) Some of this may seem bizarre. Judges and juries lack telepathy. How can courts presume to evaluate how deeply someone believes? Who is to say what your intimate relationship to your god is? The process is difficult, Rassbach concedes, but the courts delve into people’s minds all the time, he said. “Courts cannot decide whether a religious belief is true, but they can decide whether it is truly held. That’s a state of mind question, and courts do that business day in, day out.” [How religious freedom laws were praised, then hated, then forgotten, then, finally, resurrected] A murder case, for instance, might depend on proving whether someone had intent to kill. A securities fraud case, Rassbach said, asks whether the defendants intentionally deceived investors. Courts look at evidence to gauge someone’s sincerity. How does someone behave? Do they make effort to adhere to the tenets of their faith? Have they practiced their religion in this way for a long time? How do they talk about their spirituality to their friends and family? And most importantly, might they have some ulterior motive for professing these religious beliefs? These questions sometimes get muddy. In the Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court, the justices had to look at the beliefs of the companies’ religious owners, who refused to pay for employee health insurance plans that included contraceptive coverage. That would go against their religion, the owners claimed. No one denied that these bosses were devout people — and yet, did they really believe that paying for this kind of insurance violated their religion? After all, they were not directly funding contraceptives — they were several times removed from the behavior that they found unholy. Did they sincerely believe this would be a stain on their conscience? But the Supreme Court did not treat this as an issue of religious sincerity; this question was treated as an issue of doctrinal interpretation, which is territory that the court treads lightly upon. “[I]t is not for us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. “Instead, our ‘narrow function … in this context is to determine’ whether the line drawn reflects ‘an honest conviction,’ … and there is no dispute that it does.” What does this mean for the swingers church? Most of the religious scholars agreed that the swingers church would be in trouble if the city came and sued them for not being a real church. It does not look good that the swingers only started their church in response to being banned from opening their sex club at the same property. Ira “Chip” Lupu, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University, offered a different, non-religious defense. Lupu cited what has become known as the “Sister Wives” case. In 2011, the polygamous family featured on the TLC show “Sister Wives” challenged Utah’s anti-polygamy law after facing criminal charges for cohabitating. In 2013, the Federal District Court for Utah ruled that Utah’s anti-polygamy law was unconstitutional. The state could prevent people from holding two marriage licenses, but it can’t regulate what adults chose to do in private, wrote Judge Clark Waddoup. This was reasoning borrowed from Lawrence v. Texas, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003. (The case is being appealed.) A similar argument might prevail here, Lupu said. The key is that these activities are happening behind closed doors. “They’re a club. They screen members. They could do this in their house, except their house isn’t big enough or whatever.” Therefore, the swingers could argue that the government violated their right to sexual privacy when it zoned them out of their property. “I think they could make a pretty good case,” Lupu said. On Tuesday night, I called the main line at the The Social Club, which for now is still operating out of its old location downtown. The person who answered the phone called himself Peter, but declined to give his last name (“What we do — what my wife and I do privately, is between us, you know?”). Proving the old adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity, Peter said that the controversy had brought in scores of new members who either didn’t know the club existed, or thought it was illegal. “The parties have been huge since all this has happened,” he said. “It’s been outstanding, standing-room only.” Hello everyone! I’ll be reading and responding to comments today. To get the discussion started, let me ask you this: Where is the dividing line between secular beliefs and religious beliefs?

Some people in the community are unhappy about the club being near a Christian school, so they have made zoning problems for it. The club's lawyer argues that the Constitution is on their side, but the definition of a \\"religion\\" is complicated and has been debated in U.S. courts for a long time. The swingers club claims that as a church, they can have tenets similar to the Ten Commandments, like not stealing, not lying, and not cheating. Their lawyer believes that being a church will help protect them from government control since religious institutions have strong protections and freedoms in America. However, if the city tries to stop them from operating as a church, the case could be decided by whether the swingers sincerely believe their religious beliefs or are using it as a cover for their club."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 13*c = -19 - 7 for c.","completion":"Alright, little one! We're going to solve the equation for c. The equation is: 13 * c = -19 - 7 First, let's simplify the equation. We're going to subtract 7 from the -19, which is the same as adding negative 7 to negative 19: -19 + (-7) = -19 - 7 = -26 So now, our equation looks like this: 13 * c = -26 To find c, we need to \\"undo\\" the multiplication on the left side of the equation (13 times c). We do this by dividing by 13. We'll also divide the other side by 13 too like this: c = -26 ÷ 13 Now, to divide -26 by 13: -26 ÷ 13 = -2 So, we found that: c = -2 That's our answer! c is equal to -2.

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet. Choices: A). negative. B). positive. I think the answer is","completion":"A). negative. This tweet embodies a negative sentiment due to several factors present in the text. Firstly, the author expresses a lack of desire to attend school by stating, \\"I don't want to go to school yet!\\" This demonstrates that the individual is not looking forward to engaging in their educational pursuits. Furthermore, they mention a \\"stupid typhoon,\\" indicating that they are unhappy about the typhoon's interference with their plans - presumably, they previously used the typhoon as a reason to avoid going to school, and are frustrated that it has moved on and classes have resumed. The author also states, \\"it's gone when you just need it to stop classes!\\" which further highlights their dissatisfaction with the fact that classes have resumed. Their use of an exclamation mark portrays an emotionally charged reaction to the situation, which in this context, comes off as negative. They mention that they \\"don't wanna loose you,\\" the \\"you\\" in this case, referring to the typhoon, suggesting that they wish the storm would reappear or last longer, and consequently, prolong the class suspension. Finally, the phrase \\"don't go\\" further emphasizes the individual's desire for the typhoon to remain, while appealing almost desperately to the fleeting weather phenomenon. This particular statement exposes an emotional vulnerability accompanied by the speaker's displeasure with the current circumstances – all of which contribute to conveying a negative sentiment in the tweet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Paragraph: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.

Haunted by the memories of those he couldn't save, he feels disconnected from his friends and family. Scottie starts working as a local mechanic and becomes known for his aloof demeanor. One day, as Judy's car breaks down, she brings it to the mechanic shop where Scottie works. Scottie, distracted by his thoughts, doesn't pay much attention to her at first. But over time, they're thrown together in various town events and develop a friendship. Act 2: Judy and Scottie discover they share a similar emotional pain, although the details aren't yet revealed. Judy feels a strong connection to Scottie, realizing he's the only person who can understand her past. Meanwhile, Scottie finds solace in Judy's warmth and ability to make him smile again.

The film is set in the early 1980s in small town Virginia. Aurelie is the new girl in town, having recently relocated from Washington D.C. with her parents Jim (a former steward for Air Force One) and Jeanne. Jim is attending college on a scholarship to become a physician while Jeanne, now the breadwinner, works at the local chicken shack. Aurelie asks her parents if she can have a permanent to fit in with the \\"Farrah Fawcett\\" types in town. Her parents finally relent and take her to a local beauty school to get her hair processed at a discount. The result is disastrous, making Aurelie look more like orphan Annie than Farrah. She starts school and is immediately teased by everyone. She tries to befriend the only black girl in school, Lydia, but is rebuffed. Aurelie furthers her unpopularity by overly participating in class and is frequently bullied by a group of popular girls. Aurelie reluctantly takes a karate class in order to defend herself. She sees a sign on another beauty shop in town that advertises permanent fixes for 60 and resolves to make the money. Eventually the school holds a poetry reading contest, with a top prize of 75. Aurelie signs up herself and Lydia. Lydia initially does not want to participate. During the poetry contest she panics and recites the lyrics to \\"Feeling Good\\" instead of her assigned poem. Meanwhile, Aurelie is confronted by the popular girls. She uses her karate training to defeat the girls and returns to the contest to see that Lydia has been announced the winner.

The first sentence is talking about Evan Lloyd from a place called Dolobran. Evan is a son who married Gwenhafar Lloyd. Gwenhafar is the daughter of Meredith Lloyd from a place called Meivod. 2. The second sentence is a little confusing, but it seems to be talking about the son of Gwenhafar from Dolobran. This son married someone named Evan Lloyd Lloyd. Evan is the daughter of Meredith Lloyd from Meivod. There might be a mistake in this sentence, which makes it hard to understand.

In the sentence, \\"Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors modulates Jurkat T cell growth and adhesion to fibronectin,\\" the term \\"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors\\" stands out as a possible protein since it refers to receptors that enable cell communication and are involved in various biological processes."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - John the Apostle ( Koine Greek: ; Latin: \\"Ioannes\\") was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament, which refers to him as . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother was James, who was another of the Twelve Apostles. Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one to die of natural causes: Judas Iscariot died by suicide, while the other ten all are considered to have died a martyr's death. This is because the Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder and the Beloved Disciple, although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these men. The traditions of most Christian denominations have held that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament. - A gospel is an account describing the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. The most widely known examples are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John which are included in the New Testament, but the term can also used to refer to apocryphal, non-canonical, JewishChristian and gnostic gospels. - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - The Gospel of Peter (\\"kata Petrn euangelion\\"), or Gospel according to Peter, is one of the non-canonical gospels rejected as apocryphal by the Church Fathers and the Catholic Church's synods of Carthage and Rome, which established the New Testament canon. It was the first of the non-canonical gospels to be rediscovered, preserved in the dry sands of Egypt. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - The Christian Church is a term generally used to refer to the whole group of people belonging to the Christian religious tradition throughout history. In this understanding, the \\"Christian Church\\" does not refer to a particular Christian denomination but to the body of all believers. Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. - John of Patmos (also called John the Revelator, John the Divine or John the Theologian; Greek: ) is the name given to the author of the Book of Revelation, the apocalyptic text forming the final chapter of the New Testament. The text of Revelation states that the author is called John and that he lives on the Greek island of Patmos, where, by some, he is considered to be in exile as a result of anti-Christian persecution under the Roman emperor Domitian. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Patmos (Greek, \\"\\";) is a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea, most famous for being the location of both the vision of and the writing of the Christian Bible's Book of Revelation. - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people. - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" \\"\\" literally means \\"great one\\". - John the Presbyter was an obscure figure of the early Church who is either distinguished from or identified with the Apostle John, by some also John the Divine. He appears in fragments from the church father Papias of Hierapolis as one of the author's sources and is first unequivocally distinguished from the Apostle by Eusebius of Caesarea. He is frequently proposed as an alternative author of some of the Johannine books in the New Testament. - The First Epistle of John , often referred to as First John ( US ) or One John ( UK ) ( and written 1 John ) is a book of the New Testament . This fourth catholic or \`\` general '' epistle is attributed to John the Evangelist , traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John . This Epistle was probably written in Ephesus between the years 95 -- 110 . The work was written to counter docetism , which is the belief that Jesus did not come \`\` in the flesh '' , but only as a spirit . It also defined how Christians are to discern true teachers : by their ethics , their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh , and by their love . - In Christian terminology, docetism (from the Greek \\"doken\\" (to seem) \\"dóksis\\" (apparition, phantom), according to Norbert Brox, is defined narrowly as \\"the doctrine according to which the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality.\\" Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion. The word \\"Doktaí\\" (illusionists) referring to early groups who denied Jesus' humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop Serapion of Antioch (197203), who discovered the doctrine in the Gospel of Peter, during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in Rhosus, and later condemned it as a forgery. It appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: \\"the Word was made Flesh\\". - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. What is the relationship between 'first epistle of john' and 'christianity'? Answer:","completion":"The First Epistle of John is a book of the New Testament, which is a part of the Christian Bible. It is attributed to John the Evangelist, who is traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John. The First Epistle of John is an essential text in Christianity, as it addresses important themes like the belief in Jesus as the Son of God, the importance of love among Christians, and how to discern true teachers. It was written to counter docetism, a belief that Jesus did not come in the flesh but only as a spirit. Thus, the First Epistle of John plays a vital role in shaping Christian theology, beliefs, and practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is located east of Aylesbury, west of Stevenage, north-northwest of London, and southeast of Milton Keynes. - Bedfordshire (or /bdfd/; abbreviated Beds.) is a county in the East of England. It is a ceremonial county and a historic county, covered by three unitary authorities: Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, and Luton. - Chicksands is a village in the Central Bedfordshire district of Bedfordshire, England, and part of the civil parish of Campton and Chicksands, whose population in 2007 was estimated to be 2,510. By the 2011 census the figure was accurately placed at being 1,699. The village is on the River Flit and close to its parish village of Campton and the town of Shefford. - Chicksands Priory is a former monastic house at Chicksands in Bedfordshire . - Central Bedfordshire is a unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire, England. It was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009. With a budget of £500m the unitary council provides over a hundred services to a quarter of a million people, and is responsible for schools, social services, rubbish collection, roads, planning, leisure centres, libraries, care homes and more. - Campton and Chicksands is a civil parish in the English county of Bedfordshire. - The River Flit is a short river in Bedfordshire, England. It flows through Flitwick, then past Greenfield and Flitton, then through Clophill, Chicksands, and Shefford, then past Stanford, before meeting the River Ivel at Langford. Its name is not ancient, but rather a back formation from Flitton. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority.

This village is part of the civil parish of Campton and Chicksands. The civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government in England, falling below districts and counties or their combined form, the unitary authority. In this case, the higher level of local government would be the unitary authority of Central Bedfordshire, which was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009. Notably, Central Bedfordshire, the larger territorial entity overseeing Chicksands, is a part of the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire. Ceremonial counties are geographic areas, often aligning closely with historic counties, that are used for the purposes of the lieutenancy, in other words, areas which have a Lord Lieutenant.

The Albanian Fascist Party (Albanian: \\"Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë\\" , or PFSh) was a Fascist organization active during World War II which held nominal power in Albania from 1939, when the country was conquered by Italy, until 1943, when Italy capitulated to the Allies. Afterwards, Albania fell under German occupation, and the PFSh was replaced by the Guard of Greater Albania. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Albanian Fascist Party (Albanian: \\"Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë\\" , or PFSh) was a Fascist organization.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Albanian Fascist Party (Albanian: \\"Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë\\", or PFSh) was indeed a Fascist organization. This conclusion is based on the historical context of the party, its political ideology, and its association with other Fascist regimes during World War II. The Albanian Fascist Party was formed as a result of the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939. Italy, under the leadership of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, aimed to create a Fascist regime in Albania that would be closely aligned with Italian interests. As such, the Albanian Fascist Party was founded on principles of totalitarianism, nationalism, anti-communism, and the glorification of the state, which were common elements in other Fascist movements of the time. The PFSh was led by Albanian politicians who were either supportive of or acquiescent to Italian domination, as they maintained close ties with the Italian authorities and actively promoted their Fascist ideology. The collaboration between the Italian Fascist regime and the PFSh allowed for the establishment of a Fascist government in Albania, under the nominal rule of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. This government, known as the \\"Kingdom of Albania,\\" imposed Fascist policies such as censorship, political repression, and discrimination against minorities. From 1939 to 1943, the PFSh's primary function was to maintain control over Albania on behalf of the Italian Fascist regime. However, when Italy capitulated to the Allies in 1943, the PFSh lost its role as a governing party, as Germany took over the occupation of Albania. In the following months, the PFSh was replaced by the Guard of Greater Albania, which was a collaborationist force supporting the German forces occupying the country. In conclusion, the Albanian Fascist Party was undoubtedly a Fascist organization. Established under the influence of the Italian Fascist regime, it adhered to many of the core principles of Fascism, such as totalitarianism, nationalism, and a centralized authority. Throughout its existence, the PFSh acted as an instrument of Italian Fascist domination in Albania until Italy's surrender and the subsequent German occupation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The complex, at a site known as Tel Burna, is made up of rooms surrounding a giant courtyard measuring 52 feet by 52 feet. It's not certain who the cult worshiped, but based on the \\"letters of Ugarit\\" (a site located in what is now Syria), experts figure it was probably the Canaanite storm god known as Baal. Canaanites, the International Business Times explains, were people living in the region between approximately the early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Common Era. The complex yielded an array of items including pieces of face masks, person-sized ceramic jars, and animal bones that may indicate animal sacrifices took place there. As for the masks, they \\"may suggest ceremonial processions that arrived or left from the complex,\\" a researcher tells LiveScience. In addition, archaeologists found three connected cups whose use they're unsure of, though they note \\"joint vessels similar in concept ... have been considered as cultic objects.\\" Other items found include figurines that appear to show half-human, half-animal beings, as well as an artifact called a scarab, which bears an Egyptian hieroglyph. The Science Times reports that the discoveries show possible religious links between ancient civilizations; though it describes the site as \\"relatively secluded,\\" both the cups and two large jars, for instance, appear to have originated in Cyprus. (In other archeological news out of Israel, a copper awl has prompted a rethinking of ancient history.)

He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip.

Even as the measure reached the House floor, John Boehner said leaders were looking into a Plan B to raise the debt ceiling, the Hill notes. \\"I’m not going to give up hope on ‘cut, cap and balance,’ but I do think it’s responsible for us to look at what Plan B would look like,\\" he told reporters.","completion":"Title: \\"Cut, Cap, and Balance\\" Plan Approved by House of Representatives; Uncertain Fate in Senate Today, the House of Representatives passed the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan, a financial regulation bill backed heavily by the Tea Party, a faction within the United States Republican Party known for their conservative fiscal ideologies. The measure, set to continue on to the Senate, is predicted to have a slim chance of gaining approval. The act requires the exacting execution of trillions of dollars in spending cuts and necessitates a balanced-budget amendment to the United States Constitution for any potential increase in the debt ceiling. The decision in the House was largely partisan. The majority of the votes in favor of the plan came from Republican representatives, showing party allegiance with the Tea Party's ideals. Nine Republicans, however, chose to abstain from the vote, hinting at the underlying complexities within the Republican Party. Notable amongst the abstainers were Representative Michele Bachmann and Representative Ron Paul, both staunch conservatives. In contrast, five democrats opted to cross party lines and voted in support of the majority GOP (Grand Old Party, commonly known as the Republican Party). Notably, AP reports indicate President Obama, who has openly stated his intention to veto the House's decision should it reach his desk, has instead expressed support for a bipartisan plan. The president is advocating for the \\"Gang of Six\\" senators' deficit-reduction plan, a proposal that differs significantly from the Tea Party-backed measure. As the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan was being debated in the House, Speaker John Boehner spoke to reporters, expressing that the legislative leaders were already contemplating a \\"Plan B\\" for raising the debt ceiling. \\"I’m not going to give up hope on 'cut, cap and balance', but I do think it’s responsible for us to look at what Plan B would look like,\\" Boehner said as reported by The Hill. Despite the approval received in the House, the future of the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan remains uncertain.

News article: Money, Math And Medicine The current state of drug research studies traces back to a 1975 phone call between an executive at what was then the world's largest drug company and a 30-year-old Brit with longish hair and bushy sideburns named Dennis Gillings. The drug giant Hoechst (now Sanofi-Aventis ( SNY - news - people )) hired Gillings, a statistician, to figure out why 56 West Germans had died while taking its diabetes pill. The side effects threatened to doom plans to sell the drug in the U.S. Gillings, then a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, quickly figured out the problem: Patients with kidney failure were building up toxic doses of the drug. The drug made it to the market with alerts about using lower doses in kidney patients. Gillings learned from the incident that there were things drug companies needed done that he could do better than they could. While drug companies were great at inventing new medicines, they were often in over their heads when it came to analyzing mountains of data from clinical trials. \\"It became apparent that there was the possibility of making the pharmaceuticals sector more efficient,\\" explains Gillings, now 66. Inspired by this realization, Gillings founded Quintiles Transnational in 1982 in a 1,000-square-foot house with only five employees. He began to think of drug testing as a process that could be broken down into standardized steps to make it faster. He created a network of doctors interested in enrolling patients in clinical trials. He sent out monitors to doctors conducting a trial to make sure they weren't taking any shortcuts that could cause problems with regulators later on. He hired dedicated data entry people who made sure that every relevant piece of patient information was correctly filed. \\"I don't think many people thought of it like that.\\" His thinking helped foment a revolution in drug development. Today Quintiles is the leader in a secretive and powerful 20 billion industry--outsourcing clinical trials. Over the past decade Gillings' company has conducted 4,700 trials in 2.7 million patients in over half the countries in the world. But exactly which trials is it doing? Quintiles won't say. It says its Big Pharma clients want this to remain a secret. Clinical research organizations (CROs) now have some role in almost all large clinical trials, compared with about a quarter in 1993. Quintiles doesn't disclose profits but has annual sales of 3 billion, 500 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and 400 million in free cash flow. While impressive, these revenues are far short of the 10 billion in sales Gillings predicted Quintiles would have by now in a 2001 FORBES article. Once traded on Nasdaq, Quintiles was taken private in 2003 by a consortium of investors led by Gillings for 1.7 billion. He owns a 24% stake that FORBES values at 700 million including debt. The two other main owners, the private equity firms Texas Pacific Group and Bain Capital, have similar stakes. The School of Public Health at UNC was renamed for Gillings and his wife, Joan, after they made a 50 million gift in 2008. These days Gillings' hair is short and he favors impeccably cut suits. But there is a backlash brewing against Quintiles and other CROs. They raise particular ire among the university doctors who compete with Quintiles for drug company trial business. \\"My view is that they're plagued by high turnover, low quality. I don't know of a single large pharmaceutical company or a large academic research center that's happy with CROs,\\" says Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. Drug companies use them because they save time and money. CROs complete trials an average of two to four weeks faster than those done in academia or industry alone, says the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. Quintiles conducted a key safety study of the diabetes drug Avandia that was publicly savaged by a Food & Drug Administration reviewer in July. GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK - news - people ) contended that the trial showed that Avandia did not cause heart attacks. But the reviewer found crucial errors in case report forms. Major heart problems in as many as a dozen Avandia patients had never been counted, he concluded. In the wake of the new evidence an expert committee voted to severely restrict the drug's use. Quintiles points to other FDA reports that did not identify any \\"systemic or pervasive findings\\" that would undermine the data. It maintains its monitoring systems were satisfactory. CROs are \\"better than anyone\\" at compiling patient data, says Eric Topol, a Scripps Research Institute cardiologist who served on Quintiles' board of directors in the 1990s. But often \\"they overstep their bounds,\\" he says. CROs are too beholden to their drug company clients to be trusted with analyzing trial results, as they increasingly have been doing, he says. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. Dennis Gillings, a statistician, identified the importance of analyzing clinical trial data efficiently for drug companies and founded Quintiles Transnational in 1982. 2. Quintiles has since become the leader in the 20 billion industry of outsourcing clinical trials, conducting 4,700 trials in 2.7 million patients across over half the countries in the world. 3.

What went right? According to Universal's President of Domestic Distribution Nikki Rocco, \\"The film. The marketing. The advertising -- that's what went right!\\" Still, \\"","completion":"Magic Mike\\" didn't fare too poorly either. Steven Soderbergh's male-stripper dramedy, featuring the chiseled likes of Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, and Matthew McConaughey, gyrated into second place with 39.2 million from 2,930 theaters. The film's performance exceeded expectations, as it was initially projected to earn around 20-25 million. While it may not have claimed the top spot, the film's success showcased the drawing power of Tatum and the appetite of audiences for fresh, unconventional storylines. As both films managed to find their niche, they continued to jostle for dominance at the box office. In the following weeks, \\"Ted\\" maintained a strong hold on the box office, despite facing competition from other R-rated comedies, such as \\"The Campaign,\\" as well as summer blockbusters like \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" The film went on to gross over 218 million domestically and 549 million worldwide, solidifying its status as a comedy hit and positioning MacFarlane as a sought-after filmmaker. \\"Magic Mike\\" also enjoyed an extended run at the box office, ultimately earning over 113 million domestically and 167 million worldwide. The film's solid performance eventually spawned a sequel, \\"Magic Mike XXL,\\" released in July 2015. As the summer rolled on, both \\"Ted\\" and \\"Magic Mike\\" remained popular in theaters, proving that originality and daring storytelling could coexist alongside established franchises and special-effects-driven spectacles. Both films carved their respective places in the pantheon of memorable cinematic experiences of the year, delighting and surprising critics and audiences alike.

Though vastly different in content and tone, these films helped pave the way for other storytellers and filmmakers to push the creative boundaries of their work. And perhaps, their combined success served as a reminder that amidst the familiar blockbuster sequels and reboots, some of the most cherished moments in cinema can still be found in the unruly, the unexpected, and the downright outrageous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what kind of currency does cuba use?\\" A:","completion":"A: Cuba operates with a dual currency system, consisting of the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) and the Cuban Peso (CUP). The usage of these currencies is specific to certain types of transactions and sectors within the country. The Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) is pegged to the US Dollar, and it is mainly intended for transactions involving tourism and foreign trade. Visitors to Cuba typically use the CUC for purchasing goods and services like accommodations, tours, meals at restaurants, souvenirs, and transportation. By using the CUC, tourists contribute to the foreign exchange income of the country, which is essential for the Cuban economy. However, it is essential to note that due to recent regulations, US dollars are subject to a 10% penalty when exchanged to CUC. As a result, euros, pounds, and Canadian dollars are preferred options for tourists to bring into the country and convert at exchange houses called \\"CADECA.\\" On the other hand, the Cuban Peso (CUP) is the national currency utilized for domestic transactions by the Cuban population. It covers everyday expenses like groceries, utilities, transportation, and some cultural activities. The CUP is also used for salaries and pensions of the Cuban workforce, as well as in government transactions and subsidies. Additionally, some local food establishments and markets are starting to accept CUP from tourists, providing a more authentic Cuban experience for visitors. In recent years, there have been talks about currency unification, intending to reduce the complexities associated with the dual currency system. This process, however, is expected to be gradual and carefully managed by the Cuban government to minimize any potential socio-economic impacts. In summary, while visiting Cuba, it is common to use the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) for most transactions involving tourism and foreign trade, while the Cuban Peso (CUP) is principally used in domestic transactions by Cuban citizens. Understanding and adapting to this dual currency system is essential for experiencing the unique economic landscape of Cuba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres.

Q:Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long should athletes probably eat protein? Options: - All the time - even when they aren't working out - Only after working out - not enough information - Only before working out A:","completion":"Based on the provided context, it does not specify a particular time when athletes should consume protein. However, it implies that a sufficient amount of protein intake is necessary for muscle growth and repair, which correlates with their training. Therefore, athletes should focus on maintaining a desirable protein intake throughout their diet, matching their specific body and training needs. The answer here would be \\"all the time - even when they aren't working out\\" as their bodies would need consistent protein intake for proper muscle maintenance and recovery even during periods of rest. This doesn't mean an excessive amount of protein but rather a sufficient intake as part of a balanced diet, based on their body weight and the intensity of their training. It's also important to account for factors such as the athlete's overall diet, energy needs, and specific requirements of their sport. Therefore, consultation with a nutritionist or dietitian may be beneficial to determine an individual athlete's specific protein needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The modern version of what code-breaking board game for two players, that resembles an old pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows, was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert?","completion":"The modern code-breaking board game for two players invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert, is called Mastermind. This game is an adaptation of the older pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows, and it was designed to challenge the players' logic, deduction, and problem-solving skills. Mastermind, the commercial version of the game, offers a more tactile and visual experience than Bulls and Cows, as it involves a gameboard and pegs of various colors. The gameboard comprises a vertical board with holes for accommodating pegs, a shielded area where the codemaker creates the hidden pattern, and rows where the codebreaker makes their guesses. The objective of Mastermind is for the codebreaker to deduce a hidden color code created by the codemaker within a set number of tries. This hidden code consists of a sequence of colors, usually in a collection of four pegs, and is made up of six available colors (some versions have eight colors). Duplicate colors are allowed, and the player can use any combination they desire. The game proceeds in turns, with the codebreaker placing colored pegs on the board in an attempt to determine the positions and colors within the hidden code. After placing a guess, the codemaker provides feedback by placing smaller pegs (either black or white) in response to the codebreaker's attempt. A black peg represents a correct color in the correct position, while a white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position. However, the codemaker does not reveal which of the guessed pegs corresponds to the smaller pegs placed, leaving it up to the codebreaker to deduce the information using logic and pattern recognition. The codebreaker continues to make guesses, placing new rows of pegs and receiving feedback from the codemaker until either the codebreaker successfully identifies the codemaker's hidden code or runs out of guessing turns (typically 10-12 turns in most versions). The codebreaker wins if they break the code within the allotted number of turns, while the codemaker wins if their code remains unbroken. Both players can then switch roles and play again, rewarding thoughtful and strategic thinking. Mastermind enjoyed immense popularity after its creation, becoming a bestselling game worldwide during the 1970s and 1980s, with numerous editions and variations being produced since then. In 1977, Invicta Plastics, the company that produced Mastermind, even released an expanded version called Super Mastermind, which increased the difficulty of the game by enlarging the secret code to five pegs and providing eight color choices.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \\"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"4 years\\" correctly answer the question \\"How long did it take for \\"The Simpson's Movie\\" to come to fruition?\\"? pick from the following. -- no. -- yes.","completion":"Yes, based on the paragraph, the response \\"4 years\\" does correctly answer the question \\"How long did it take for \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" to come to fruition?\\" The paragraph states that the film took four years to come to fruition as explained by writer Al Jean.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Dwyane Wade isn't 'cocky' enough for a Kobe-style retirement tour Kobe Bryant's retirement tour has consumed this entire Los Angeles Lakers season. Whenever they go on the road, he's serenaded with applause and saluted with gifts and pregame montage videos. The tribute is well deserved, but bloated. He's an all-time great player who deserves all the attention and adoration NBA fans across the world are giving him. That's 100 percent his right. But Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade doesn't think something like that will be for him when it comes time for the 34-year-old to say goodbye (via Sun-Sentinel): Wade said he could not envision himself in the same sphere as Bryant, playing to regular tributes before and after games. \\"I don't know,\\" he said. \\"I don't sit back and say, 'Oh, when I retire.' I'm not that cocky to say, 'I want a farewell tour when I retire.' For me, that's a little too cocky of a mindset to have, thinking I'm that important, that I should get a farewell tour.\\" Wade shouldn't have to worry about retirement for quite some time. Despite a noticeable drop in his night-to-night athleticism, Miami's starting shooting guard is averaging 19.1 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game. He's shooting 45.3 percent from the floor and his free-throw rate is the same now as it was in 2012. That's remarkable. More importantly, the Heat are good! And so long as Wade keeps his salary down to a reasonable level when free agency negotiations get underway this summer, there's no reason why the team can't be even better next season—with improved youngsters like Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow in the mix, alongside a presumably healthy Chris Bosh, increasingly comfortable Goran Dragic and re-signed Hassan Whiteside. The Eastern Conference should be wide open next year, and Miami will be one squad looking to take it. Bryant is 37 years old and nowhere near his prime, but if there were even the slightest chance the Lakers could have made a deep playoff run over the next few months, there's no chance he'd have announced his retirement when and how he did. What was this article about?","completion":"The article centers around the contrasting retirement approaches of two renowned National Basketball Association (NBA) players, Dwyane Wade and Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant's retirement was an upscale event that spanned a whole Los Angeles Lakers season, filled with broad public recognition, gifts, montage videos and applause, a tribute that the article deems well-deserved but excessive. Meanwhile, Dwyane Wade, a Miami Heat guard, sees his own future retirement from a different perspective. He stated that he couldn't envision himself in the same circumstances as Bryant, playing amidst regular tributes before and after games. Wade expressed that planning for a retirement tour was too \\"cocky\\" of a mindset for him to adopt, as it would imply an exaggerated self-importance. However, the article insinuates that Wade has nothing to worry about when it comes to retirement. Even with his diminishing athleticism, his performance remains strong. He's averaging 19.1 points, 4.7 assists, and 4.1 rebounds per match, shooting 45.3 percent from the floor, and his free-throw rate is the same as it was in 2012. Moreover, the article highlights that Miami Heat is a good team and could be even better next season. This would be possible if Wade keeps his salary at a reasonable level during the free agency negotiations and if young talents such as Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow continue to improve and if Chris Bosh returns healthy. The team also looks forward to an increasingly comfortable Goran Dragic and a re-signed Hassan Whiteside. Finally, the article suggests that Kobe Bryant's retirement announcement may have come differently if the Los Angeles Lakers had the slightest chance of making a deep playoff run in the months that followed. This is not the case, which may have influenced the grand retirement approach taken by Bryant, as opposed to Wade's humble approach to the idea of his future retirement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make lemon water","completion":"To make lemon water, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather ingredients and tools To make lemon water, you will need: - 1 lemon - Water (preferably filtered or spring water) - A glass or a bottle - A knife - A cutting board - Optional: a juicer for squeezing out more lemon juice - Optional: sweetener like honey, agave syrup, or stevia (if you prefer a slightly sweet taste) Step 2: Wash and prepare the lemon Thoroughly rinse the lemon under running water. This step is important to remove any dirt, bacteria, or pesticides that might be present on the lemon's skin. Step 3: Cut the lemon Place the lemon on the cutting board and, using the knife, carefully slice it in half. You can either cut it lengthwise or across, depending on your preference. Cutting lengthwise usually results in more juice while cutting across makes the lemon easier to squeeze by hand. Step 4: Squeeze the lemon Hold one lemon half over the glass or bottle, and gently squeeze it to release the juice into the container. You may use a juicer to extract more juice if you have one. Squeeze both halves of the lemon or only use one depending on how strong you want the lemon flavor to be. Keep in mind that more lemon juice will make the lemon water more acidic. Step 5: Add water Fill the glass or bottle with water (preferably cold). If you want to make warm lemon water, heat the water first in a kettle or microwave, then pour it over the lemon juice. Step 6: Sweeten (optional) If you prefer your lemon water slightly sweet, add a bit of your chosen sweetener (honey, agave syrup, or stevia) and mix well to dissolve it. Step 7: Stir and enjoy Stir the lemon water to ensure that the lemon juice and sweetener (if used) are well distributed. Your lemon water is now ready to enjoy. Drink it immediately for the freshest taste and maximum health benefits. Note: You can make lemon water in larger quantities and store it in the refrigerator for later use.

The answer is:","completion":"In order to provide the correct answer to the question \\"what makes the pupils sensitive?\\" considering the given information, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the question The question asks what makes the pupils sensitive. The term \\"sensitive\\" implies that pupils respond to certain stimuli or changes in the environment. Step 2: Analyze the given information The given information is that dilation makes the pupils sensitive. Dilation is the process by which the pupils widen to allow more light to enter the eye. Step 3: Determine the role of nerves In the context of pupil dilation, nerves are responsible for transmitting messages from the brain to the muscles that control the size of the pupils. As a result, nerves play a crucial role in making the pupils sensitive to changes in light levels. Step 4: Assess the role of nerves in relation to the given information Since nerves are involved in the process of controlling pupil size, it is logical to say that they contribute to the sensitivity of the pupils. Step 5: Provide the answer Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to say that the right answer to the question \\"what makes the pupils sensitive?\\" is \\"nerves\\", given that dilation (which is regulated by nerves) makes the pupils sensitive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"In the 1980 television film \\"This Year's Blonde,\\" the Russian-American talent agent Johnny Hyde is portrayed by actor Lloyd Bridges. This film, directed by John Erman, is a biographical drama based on the early life and career of Norma Jeane Dougherty, who would later become famed American actress and model Marilyn Monroe. The story primarily revolves around the relationship between Johnny Hyde and Marilyn Monroe as he helps her navigate the treacherous territory of Hollywood and builds her career, eventually turning her into a star. Lloyd Bridges, born in 1913, was an American actor with an extensive career spanning over six decades and encompassing over 150 film and television appearances. He started his career in acting during the 1930s, working primarily in theatre and transitioning to film and television later. He rose to prominence with his lead role in the television series \\"Sea Hunt\\" (1958-1961), where he played ex-Navy frogman and freelance scuba diver Mike Nelson. Throughout his career, Lloyd Bridges appeared in various well-known films, including \\"High Noon\\" (1952), \\"Airplane!\\" (1980), \\"Airplane II: The Sequel\\" (1982), and \\"Hot Shots!\\" (1991). His acting prowess made him adept at playing a variety of roles, ranging from drama and action to comedy and parody. As Johnny Hyde in \\"This Year's Blonde,\\" Bridges convincingly brought to life the character of a determined and influential talent agent who played a pivotal role in shaping Marilyn Monroe's career. \\"This Year's Blonde\\" offers a unique insight into Marilyn Monroe's early years, focusing on her relationship with Johnny Hyde and the obstacles she faced within the film industry. While several other biographical productions highlight different aspects of Monroe's life, \\"This Year's Blonde\\" stands out for shedding light on the lesser-known first steps in her career and the mentorship she received from Johnny Hyde, as portrayed by the charismatic and talented Lloyd Bridges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move faster? A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The answer to this question is Group Jones. Their cans had the air molecules inside move faster, leading to increased pressure and resulting in the cans exploding due to not venting them before heating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 - December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \\"You Send Me\\", \\"Wonderful World\\", \\"Chain Gang\\", and \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\". The first funeral service for Cooke was held on December 18, 1964, at A. R. Leak Funeral Home in Chicago; 200,000 fans lined up for more than four city blocks to view his body. Afterward, his body was flown back to Los Angeles for a second service, at the Mount Sinai Baptist Church on December 19, which included a much-heralded performance of \\"The Angels Keep Watching Over Me\\" by Ray Charles, who stood in for grief-stricken Bessie Griffin. Cooke was interred in the Garden of Honor, Lot 5728, Space 1, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Two singles and an album were released in the month after his death. One of the singles, \\"Shake\\", reached the top ten of both the pop and R&B charts. The B-side, \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", is considered a classic protest song from the era of the Civil Rights Movement . It was a top 40 pop hit and a top 10 R&B hit. The album, also titled Shake, reached the number one spot for R&B albums. After Cooke's death, his widow, Barbara, married Bobby Womack. Cooke's daughter, Linda, later married Womack's brother, Cecil. Bertha Franklin said she received numerous death threats after shooting Cooke. She left her position at the Hacienda Motel and did not publicly disclose where she had moved. After being cleared by the coroner's jury, she sued Cooke's estate, citing physical injuries and mental anguish suffered as a result of Cooke's attack. Her lawsuit sought US200,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. Barbara Womack countersued Franklin on behalf of the estate, seeking 7,000 in damages to cover Cooke's funeral expenses. Elisa Boyer provided testimony in support of Franklin in the case. In 1967, a jury ruled in favor of Franklin on both counts, awarding her 30,000 in damages. Was Cookes attack on her physical in nature","completion":"Yes, according to available information, Sam Cooke's attack on Bertha Franklin was physical in nature. On the night of December 11, 1964, Cooke was involved in an altercation with the hotel's manager, Bertha Franklin, at Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles. Various accounts of the events leading up to Cooke's death suggested that he had taken a woman named Elisa Boyer to the motel, who later ran off with his clothes, claiming that he had tried to rape her. In search of Boyer and his clothes, a frantic Cooke went to the motel office and forcefully entered the manager's office, where Bertha Franklin was present. Franklin testified that Cooke, wearing only a sports jacket and shoes, approached her in a threatening manner, demanding to know the whereabouts of the woman he was with earlier. Fearing for her life, Franklin attempted to restrain him by using a broomstick, eventually resorting to using a firearm. As a result of the ensuing altercation, Cooke was fatally shot. Franklin's account of the incident, in which she stated that Cooke had physically attacked her, was supported by evidence of her injuries and the fact that a struggle had occurred, alongside Elisa Boyer's testimony in court. In 1967, a jury ultimately ruled in favor of Bertha Franklin, awarding her damages in the lawsuit she filed against Cooke's estate for the physical injuries and mental anguish she suffered as a result of the attack."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch.

The Chargers would strike back in the second quarter as running back LaDainian Tomlinson got a 1-yard touchdown run. Oakland would respond with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 37-yard field goal. San Diego would close out the half with kicker Nate Kaeding making a 47-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, the Raiders would retake the lead in the fourth quarter as Janikowski nailed a 35-yard field goal. The Chargers would take the lead as quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson.

Back when James was single, he had numerous opportunities to engage in various activities and hobbies that he enjoyed. He could hang out with friends, attend parties, go on spontaneous road trips, and make last-minute plans without worrying about how it would affect his partner or household. The single life allowed him to discover new interests, meet new people, and gain valuable experiences that contributed to his continuous personal growth. One of the most appealing aspects of single life is the option to date and explore different kinds of relationships with various individuals. The thrill of sharing experiences with diverse partners, each with distinct personalities and quirks, allowed James to learn more about his own preferences and the qualities he values in a romantic partner. Moreover, the excitement of that initial attraction and the butterflies felt during the first dates or romantic encounters were unforgettable experiences that he cherished. Being single also provided James the independence to engage in self-reflection, work on his personal goals, and focus on advancing his career without any distractions. Making major life decisions without considering the repercussions on another person's life or future became a luxury that he could no longer afford in his domestic life.

RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV and, beginning with the ninth season, VH1. The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The first season of Drag Race was accompanied by a seven-episode web series, titled Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race. LOGOonline published a webisode of Under the Hood after each episode of Drag Race. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the green room, replays pertinent moments from Drag Race, and airs deleted footage. Starting with the second season of Drag Race in 2010, Logo reformatted Under the Hood, increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked. Logo broadcast an episode of Untucked after each episode of Drag Race. Untucked replaces the basic green room of Under the Hood with two decorated rooms that were until season 6 sponsored by Absolut Vodka and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season 6. These two backstage areas allow for separated group conversation. At the start of the seventh season of the Drag Race, Untucked reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, Untucked was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, Untucked returned to television. How long was it on tv?","completion":"RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked started as a web series in 2010 and then moved to television from season 2. It returned to being a web series from season 7 and continued as such through seasons 8 and 9. In the tenth season, Untucked returned to television. To determine how long Untucked was on TV, we need to consider the seasons it was broadcasted on television: 1. Seasons 2 through 6 (5 seasons) 2. Season 10 (1 season) Untucked was on TV for a total of 6 seasons. However, it is important to note that the specific length in terms of years or months would depend on the airing dates of each season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The lyrics were rearranged by the Lebanese singer Majida El Roumi and music was written by Kadim Al Sahir .","completion":"No, these sentences are not paraphrases of each other. They have different meanings due to inaccurately interchanging the roles of Majida El Roumi and Kadim Al Sahir. In the first sentence, it says that Majida El Roumi wrote the lyrics, and Kadim Al Sahir rearranged the music. It suggests that the original song lyrics were created by Majida El Roumi and Kadim Al Sahir took the existing music and modified it to create a new arrangement. The second sentence, on the other hand, claims that Majida El Roumi rearranged the lyrics, while Kadim Al Sahir wrote the music. This sentence implies that the original song lyrics were modified by Majida El Roumi, and Kadim Al Sahir composed the music for the song. The focus is shifted from Majida El Roumi's role in writing the lyrics to her role in rearranging them, which leads to a misunderstanding. A paraphrase of the first sentence should maintain the information about who wrote the lyrics and who rearranged the music without any alteration, and could be phrased like this: \\"Lebanese singer Majida El Roumi penned the lyrics, while the music was rearranged by Kadim Al Sahir.\\" In this paraphrase, you can see that the roles of Majida El Roumi and Kadim Al Sahir remain consistent with the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly. Women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly, a new study has revealed. As their body defences weaken with the passing years, the increasing susceptibility of men to disease shortens their lives, it is claimed. Life expectancy in the UK is 79 years for men and 82 for women, according to the World Health Organisation. In Japan, where the research took place, the gap is wider. There, the average lifespan of men is the same as in the UK, but women live to 85.5. The study involved examining blood samples from healthy volunteers with a wide range of ages. Scientists tested the blood of 356 men and women aged between 20 and 90 and looked at levels of white blood cells and immune system signalling molecules called cytokines. In both sexes, the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age, but closer study revealed striking differences between men and women. The rate of decline of most T-cell and B-cell lymphocytes, two key elements of the immune system, was faster in men. Similarly, men showed a more rapid age-related decline in the two cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10. Two specific types of immune system cell that actively destroy foreign invaders, CD4 T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, increased in number with age. In this case, the rate of increase was higher in women than in men. NK cells are believed to be one of the body's first lines of defence against cancer. The research, led by Professor Katsuiku Hirokawa, from Tokyo Medical and Dental University, appears in the online journal Immunity and Ageing. The scientists wrote: ‘Age-related changes in various immunological parameters differ between men and women. Our findings indicate that the slower rate of decline in these immunological parameters in women than in men is consistent with the fact that women live longer than do men.’ Immune system mechanisms not only protect the body from infection and cancer, but can cause disease when not properly regulated. In both sexes, the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age but the rate of decrease was quicker in men. Inflammation is a potentially damaging immune system response that contributes to heart and artery disease and could play a role in dementia. The cytokine IL-10 is an important regulator of inflammation, helping to put the brakes on the immune system to keep it under control. Its faster decline in men suggests that as men age they might more rapidly be affected by inflammatory conditions. Professor Hirokawa said: ‘The process of ageing is different for men and women for many reasons. Women have more oestrogen than men which seems to protect them from cardiovascular disease until menopause. Sex hormones also affect the immune system, especially certain types of lymphocytes. ‘Because people age at different rates, a person's immunological parameters could be used to provide an indication of their true biological age.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

A. wait for B. dress nice C. go for haircut D. bathe E. shave The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is B. dress nice. In the given scenario, it appears that the individual is placing a significant amount of importance on the date, even though it may not be entirely necessary based on the person they are meeting (\\"it wasn't shaggy\\"). However, this eagerness and excitement for the date can be attributed to the individual's personal desire to make a good impression. The remaining options are: A. Wait for C. Go for a haircut D. Bathe E. Shave Option A, \\"wait for,\\" is not an ideal choice, as waiting for something is not an active measure the individual can take to prepare for the date. Additionally, it is not contextually clear what the person might be waiting for in this instance. Option C, \\"go for a haircut,\\" does not seem to be a pressing concern based on the statement that their date is not \\"shaggy\\", indicating that the individual's hair is likely not unkempt or in need of significant grooming. Option D, \\"bathe,\\" is essential for general hygiene, but it is not particularly specific to the situation. It is a commonplace action that most people engage in before going on a date or attending an event. Option E, \\"shave,\\" might be related to personal grooming, but it seems less relevant in this context, as the focus is on the overall appearance and presentation. Therefore, the best answer is B: dress nice. Dressing nicely is an active choice that the individual can make to reflect the significance they place on the date.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In 1966,Allen and Beatrice Garden, two professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, had a bright idea.They were interested in the evolution of language and the language abilities of great apes . Previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to talk had ended in failure and the matter was considered by most people to be closed. But the Gardens realized that speech and the language are not the same thing. Many deaf people, for example, are unable to speak but are perfectly able to communicate by gestures that have all the features of spoken language. The Garders suspected that previous experiments had failed because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak. They therefore decided to try teaching a chimpanzee to sign in the way that deaf people do. And their chosen _ , a female chimpanzee named Washoe after the country in which the university is, proved to be a skillful pupil. Though there is still debate about whether what Washoe learned was really equal to human language, there is no doubt that she learned a lot of words. All of this, however, raises a second question. If Washoe can learn a complex vocabulary of gestures from people, do they have such vocabularies naturally ? To examine that possibility, Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal of Emory University have looked at gestures and expressions in chimpanzees, Signaling by facial and oral expressions is common among primates . Signaling by gestures is limited to great apes. The researchers supposed that the meaning of expressions has been fixed by evolution while the meaning of gestures is learnt. If that were true, particular sorts of facial and oral expressions would occur only in particular circumstances, and this would be the same across groups and even species. The same gestures, on the contrary, would be used in different circumstances. The researchers found exactly what they expected. Expressions almost always occurred in the same circumstances in different groups and different species. Gestures seemed to have completely different meanings.... Answer:","completion":"Which statement is correct regarding the reasons behind Allen and Beatrice Garden's decision to teach chimpanzees sign language, based on the article? A. They believed that chimpanzees already had an innate ability to use sign language. B. They wanted to prove that chimpanzees were not intelligent enough to learn sign language. C. They knew that great apes naturally have complex vocabularies and wanted to build on that knowledge. D. They suspected that previous experiments had failed due to chimpanzees being physically unable to speak. In the article, Allen and Beatrice Garden, professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, decided to teach a chimpanzee to sign like deaf people because they realized that speech and language are not the same thing. They suspected that previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to talk had ended in failure because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (; Hindustani: ['mo:h@nda:s 'k@r@mtS@nd 'ga:ndhi] ( listen); 2 October 1869 - 30 January 1948) was an Indian activist who was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. In 1919, Gandhi then aged 49, after the World War I was over, sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917-18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. Gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \\"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\\". Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey. The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. By the end of 1922 the Khilafat movement had collapsed. Turkey's Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, Khilafat movement ended, and Muslim support for Gandhi largely evaporated. Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and his Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Is there anything you found particularly interesting?","completion":"Yes, I found it interesting how Mohandas Gandhi, an important leader in India, tried to bring Hindu and Muslim communities together. He did this by supporting the Khilafat movement, which was important for many Muslims. For a while, this helped to stop violence between the two groups. But, later, the movement ended and unfortunately, the fighting between Hindu and Muslim people started again. It shows how difficult it can be to bring people together when they have different beliefs but also how leaders like Gandhi can have a big impact on people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you exercise your option, you buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying stock at the price stated in the contract. If your options have value relative to the actual stock price, you are \\"in the money.\\" A call option allows you to buy stock at the stated strike price. You'll make money if the stock is trading at a higher price than your stock price, because you can buy shares at your lower strike price. You could then turn around and sell those shares at the actual price to make money. If you have put options, you have the right to sell stock at the strike price listed on your contract. You'll make money if you exercise your options when the stock is selling at a much lower price on the open market. You are essentially forcing someone to buy shares at a higher price. You can then buy more shares at the lower price, or simply pocket the difference. For example, if you own a call option for stock at the strike price of 50, and the stock is currently selling at 100, you are \\"in the money\\" because you can buy the stock for half the price it's actually trading for. Likewise, if you owned put options for stock at the strike price of 100, and it is currently selling at 50, you are \\"in the money\\" because you can force someone to buy the stock at twice the price it's currently trading for. If you have American-style options, you can exercise them at any time – you don't have to wait until the expiration date. Exercising an option well before the expiration date means losing potential value. However, waiting it out comes with a risk that the stock price won't move the way you've predicted. For example, suppose you are in the money on call options that don't expire for 6 months. You could exercise them now and buy the stock at your strike price. However, if the stock continues to rise, you could potentially make more money by exercising the option later. Even with American-style options, most options aren't exercised until close to their expiration date. This gives options holders the opportunity to maximize the time value of their options. To exercise a put option, you must first own the underlying stock. If you're exercising a call option, on the other hand, you need the resources to purchase the underlying stock at the strike price. Your broker may have its own rules about how much money you need to have in your account to exercise your options. Call customer service or check the educational resources on your broker's website for specific rules. You can't trade options without a broker. If you have an online broker, you may not have to do anything more than click a button. Your broker will take several steps behind the scenes to exercise your options for you. The process is somewhat complex, but in reality it typically only takes a few minutes. You don't have any sort of relationship with the investor who is assigned the options you exercise. In fact, you likely won't even know who they are. The process is done electronically by the relevant options clearing house. When your options have been exercised, your broker will deposit your profits (less fees and commissions) into your account. For a put option, you'll have a cash deposit. For a call option, you'll have shares in the underlying stock. Commissions and fees for the transaction will be deducted from your account. If you exercised a call option, the commissions and fees will come out of the cash in your account, not from selling the shares of stock you purchased through your options contracts. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is: When you exercise an option, you can buy (call) or sell (put) a stock at a specific price stated in the contract. If the stock price is more favorable than your contract price, you are \\"in the money.\\" Call options let you buy shares at a lower price, while put options let you sell shares at a higher price.

Answer: Income includes wages and salaries, unemployment insurance, disability payments, child support payments received, regular rental receipts, as well as any personal business, investment, or other kinds of income received routinely. Question: what is the average american income The answer is:","completion":"The concept of household income encompasses various sources of earnings, as indicated in the original question, inclusive of wages, salaries, unemployment insurance, disability payments, child support payments received, regular rental receipts, and income derived from personal businesses, investments, or other routine sources. When it comes to determining the average American income, it is essential to consider different aspects, such as the median household income, mean (average) household income, and even individual income. The most commonly referenced metric for understanding average American income is median household income. This represents the midpoint of all household incomes, meaning that half of the households earn above this level and half earn below. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey (the most recent data available at the time of writing), the median household income in the United States was 68,700. However, if you want to focus on the mean (average) household income rather than the median, the statistics are slightly different. Mean household income is calculated by dividing the total income of households by the number of households. This value can sometimes be skewed by higher-income households, causing the average to be somewhat higher than the median. For 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau reported a mean household income of approximately 94,700. It's also important to consider individual income, which refers to the income earned per person in a household, regardless of the number of earners. According to the 2019 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median personal income for all American workers (both full and part-time) was around 41,950, while the mean personal income was approximately 55,790. It's important to note that these figures are likely to vary depending on age, education, occupation, and a range of other factors. In conclusion, the concept of \\"average American income\\" can be assessed through multiple perspectives. While median household income at 68,700 offers a good overall measure of the financial standing of American households, it is equally important to consider other aspects such as mean household income (94,700) and individual income (median 41,950 and mean 55,790) to gain a thorough understanding of the income distribution in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: myanmar junta chief sets ground rules for polls Text:","completion":"In a recent development, the Myanmar junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has established the ground rules for the upcoming polls in the country. This follows the military coup in February 2021, which led to the overthrow of the democratically elected government and imprisonment of its leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta chief's gesture is seen as an attempt to pave the way for the military to maintain control over the political landscape, while providing a semblance of democratic procedure. The ground rules set forth greatly impact the country's electoral process, as they directly influence the conduct and outcomes of the polls. Firstly, these ground rules outline the basic criteria for political parties and candidates. All participants must adhere to the guidelines set by the military, which may potentially limit the freedom of expression and choice for those involved in the elections. Furthermore, the military retains the power to disqualify any political party or candidate that fails to comply with the established regulations, which could result in a biased representation of the people's will. Secondly, the junta chief's ground rules emphasize the importance of maintaining order and security during the electoral period. This involves deploying military forces to monitor the conduct of the polls and ensure compliance with the regulations. While this measure claims to protect the integrity of the election process, it may also instill fear and intimidation among voters and political activists, thereby suppressing the true voice of the people. Lastly, the ground rules specify that the election commission will be responsible for counting and validating the votes. However, critics argue that the military's influence over the commission may lead to discrepancies in the electoral results. This lack of transparency and independence can potentially undermine the legitimacy of the polls. In conclusion, the Myanmar junta chief's announcement of ground rules for the upcoming polls marks a contentious development in the country's political landscape. These regulations, while claiming to be democratic, may inadvertently serve the interests of the military regime, hindering the restoration of representative democracy in Myanmar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the world's biggest selling copyrighted board game????","completion":"The world's biggest selling copyrighted board game is Monopoly. Monopoly was first published by Parker Brothers, now a subsidiary of Hasbro, in 1935. It's regarded as the most commercially successful board game in U.S. board game history. The game is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity. Monopoly Gameplay: The game is designed to be played by two to eight players. Players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels, borrowing money from the bank, and collecting rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them all into bankruptcy, leaving one monopolist in control of the economy. The game board represents a miniaturized, stylized version of a city. Traditionally, the city has been Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the United States, but versions of the game have been created based on multiple cities around the world. Historical Background: The origins of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903, when Elizabeth Magie, a feminist, engineer, and writer, created a board game called 'The Landlord's Game'. The game was designed to demonstrate the economic ill effects of land monopolism and the use of land value tax as a remedy for them. In 1935, Charles Darrow, an unemployed domestic heater salesman, claimed the idea as his own and sold it to Parker Brothers. Impact and Sales: Over more than eight decades, Monopoly has been published in 47 languages and sold in 114 countries. More than 275 million game sets have been sold worldwide. In regards to digital versions, they have been developed for platforms like iOS, Android, and gaming consoles. Versions of Monopoly: Over time, different versions and themes of Monopoly have been produced, ranging from the likes of Star Wars Monopoly to Disney Monopoly. Special editions like Monopoly: Fortnite Edition have also been wildly popular among fans. Monopoly has also been made into slot and lottery games, reality TV shows, and video games. Monopoly, with its common experience of tense family gameplay, has become a cultural icon, symbolizing the pitfalls and triumphs of capitalism. Its longevity and adaptability to new platforms have ensured its place as the world's biggest selling copyrighted board game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"toxins.\\" When you burn green plants, they can be used to produce electricity through a process called biomass energy conversion. Biomass refers to any organic material derived from plants or animals that can be used to generate energy. When green plants or other biomass sources are burned, their stored chemical energy is released as heat. This heat can be used to produce steam, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity. While burning plants does release some pollutants like carbon dioxide and other particulate matter, it is inappropriate to say that the main product is toxins.

Gossip website TheDirty.com claims to have acquired more sexually explicit online chats between Anthony Weiner and a young woman — chats that the site claims took place after Weiner resigned from Congress in disgrace in 2011. The site claims Weiner used the laughable name \\"Carlos Danger\\" in some of his messages and sent sexually-charged messages as late as last summer. Weiner responded to the allegations, saying, \\"while some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong.\\" Read the full statement. Update, 5:40 p.m.: At a press conference this evening, standing next to his wife Huma Abedin, Weiner began by reading his earlier statement. He introduced himself as a Democratic candidate for Mayor. \\"In many ways, things are not that much different than they were yesterday,\\" he continued, repeating his assertion that he expected more such communications to emerge. He also addressed the timing of the revelations. Some of them, he stated, happened before he resigned from office, some after — though he wasn't clear which messages to the anonymous person fell into which category. Weiner then turned the podium over to his wife. \\"Our marriage, like many others, has had a lot of ups and downs,\\" she said. \\"Anthony's made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after. … But I do very strongly believe that that's between us.\\" She concluded: \\"I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him.\\" \\"As I've said, it's in our rear view mirror — but it's not far,\\" he said toward the end of the press conference. Asked when the last text or message was, Weiner said it occurred last summer, after he and his wife gave an interview to People magazine. That article, which introduced his newborn child to the world, included this line: \\"Anthony has spent every day since [the scandal] trying to be the best dad and husband he can be,\\" [Huma] says of her husband, who does all the laundry. \\"I'm proud to be married to him.\\" Weiner then stopped answering questions, insisting that he wouldn't get into a back-and-forth with anyone presenting new messages. Original story: In three posts, The Dirty shares screenshots from chats allegedly involving Weiner. One is from Facebook, with Weiner asking the unidentified woman to delete her chats. Another contains chats from Formspring.com in which a user named \\"Dangr33\\" makes sexually explicit comments. (The avatar for that account, apparently of a model named \\"Krysta Kaos,\\" is at left.) The third includes a Facebook message checking in after \\"the onslaught\\" to see if \\"we are ok.\\" That post also includes a censored photograph purportedly including Weiner's penis. Here's what we know about this mystery person, whom The Dirty refers to as a \\"young female girl.\\" The site says that she and Weiner had a relationship for six months; in a statement, she says she was 22 at the time. That relationship, the site claims, was primarily centered around phone sex — they spoke \\"daily multiple times a day.\\" At one point, Weiner offers to propose that she be included in a panel of bloggers organized by Politico, implying she works in media. (Politico's events page doesn't include any such panel.) Her Formspring account name appears to start with an \\"s\\" and end with an \\"o.\\" Not much to go on. There are several reasons to be skeptical of the claim that this was a relationship that happened after Weiner's behavior became public — if it happened at all. None of the screenshots include information about the date, but only the time of day. The only mention of the scandal involving Weiner, from that third message, seems to clearly indicate that Weiner and the recipient of the message knew each other before the scandal became public. The Dirty indicates that Weiner contacted her last August to help her get a condo in Chicago, but it's, again, not clear how that timeline lined up with the explicit relationship. If any: The explicit messages are all from the \\"Carlos Danger\\" account. Update, 1:30 p.m.: We have at least one indication that the person involved in some Facebook messages was, in fact, candidate Anthony Weiner. One exchange included the following reference to Weiner's cats. At the time that Weiner's original exchanges came to light, the image at right was included among them. It shows Weiner seated on a couch with two cats. Someone who worked closely with Weiner in the past contacted us and attested that Weiner does indeed have a cat with one eye. So there's that. Update, 3:00 p.m.: A new post at The Dirty offers a timeline from the recipient of Weiner's messages. According to her: The two began communicating last July. On July 19, Weiner started following her on Formspring. By August, the two were exchanging explicit messages over email and Formspring. At this point, Weiner allegedly offered to get the condo in Chicago. By November, the relationship had all but ended. When The Times' profile of Weiner came out in April (see below), he sent her a Facebook message to ask what she thought. Again, these details haven't been confirmed. When he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City, Weiner did warn that additional texts might come out. That campaign has been largely predicated on asking city residents whether or not he deserves the benefit of the doubt on the whole affair. In an interview with The New York Times in April — which also mentions the two cats — he said: \\"I want to ask people to give me a second chance. I do want to have that conversation with people whom I let down and with people who put their faith in me and who wanted to support me. I think to some degree I do want to say to them, 'Give me another chance.'\\" Whether or not he gets the benefit of the doubt in this case could decide if he gets that chance. It could be the point on which his future ambitions hinge. Update, 2:25 p.m.: Anthony Weiner issued a statement in response. I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have. As I have said in the past, these things that I did were wrong and hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from Congress. While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused. As my wife and I have said, we are focused on moving forward. Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments or send an email to the author at pbump at theatlantic dot com.

Rodent models are an indispensable tool for studying etiology and progress of depression. Since interrelated systems of neurotrophic factors and cytokines comprise major regulatory mechanisms controlling normal brain plasticity, impairments of these systems form the basis for development of cerebral pathologies, including mental diseases. The present review focuses on the numerous experimental rodent models of depression induced by different stress factors (exteroceptive and interoceptive) during early life (including prenatal period) or adulthood, giving emphasis to the data on the changes of neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammatory indices in the brain. These parameters are closely related to behavioral depression-like symptoms and impairments of neuronal plasticity and are both gender- and genotype-dependent. Stress-related changes in expression of neurotrophins and cytokines in rodent brain are region-specific. Some contradictory data reported by different groups may be a consequence of differences of stress paradigms or their realization in different laboratories. Like all experimental models, stress-induced depression-like conditions are experimental simplification of clinical depression states; however, they are suitable for understanding the involvement of neurotrophic factors and cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease-a goal unachievable in the clinical reality. These major regulatory systems may be important targets for therapeutic measures as well as for development of drugs for treatment of depression states.","completion":"Title: Exploring Stress-Induced Rodent Models of Depression: Neurotrophic Factors, Neuroinflammation, and Implications for Treatment"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Details in exchange for this - I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking about the 6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges since last spring: \\"We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'\\" The lead of the story was this: \\"The California Independent System Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund the state a stunning 6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since last May.\\" First of all, tell me what the difference is between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically unattractive. Then you get details. Kate Write a subject line for this email.","completion":"Subject: Understanding the Difference Between Overcharges and Excessive Charges, Analyzing ISO's Statement, and Evaluating the Lead of the Article Dear Kate, Thank you for sharing the article with me and seeking clarification on the points raised in the news piece. The difference between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges can be subtle, but it may carry important implications in certain contexts. Here's a detailed explanation of these terms and an analysis of the quote from the ISO market analyst. 1. Difference between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges: - Overcharges: This term generally implies that a customer has been billed more than what they should have been, with the assumption that a mistake or an intentional act led to a higher price than the agreed-upon or reasonable rate. In this context, it often carries an implication of misconduct or a breach of contract. - Excessive charges: This term, on the other hand, is broader and typically refers to high prices that might be deemed unreasonable but not necessarily incorrect. A charge can be excessive even if technically correct, like high prices due to natural market fluctuations or unforeseen circumstances. In the article, when the analyst says, \\"We are not saying now that these are overcharges,\\" it seems that they are trying to avoid accusations of misconduct or impropriety on the part of generators and suppliers. However, their use of the term \\"excessive\\" acknowledges that the charges are higher than what the system operator believes is reasonable. 2. Journalistic and Grammatical analysis of the lead: - Journalistically incorrect: This lead might be considered journalistically incorrect due to the way it frames the situation. The use of the word \\"stunning\\" in reference to the 6.2 billion in refunds implies that the story is biased or editorialized. As per journalistic principles, a news report should strive for objectivity, and by labeling the sum \\"stunning,\\" the reporter may have failed to maintain the required impartiality. - Grammatically unattractive: From a grammatical perspective, the lead seems to be constructed of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction, making it a compound sentence. However, the sentence structure and punctuation can be improved for better readability. For instance, it would be more grammatically attractive to rephrase the lead as follows: \\"The California Independent System Operator significantly increased its demands on Thursday by telling the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund the state a staggering 6.2 billion for electricity sold since last May.\\" In conclusion, it's crucial to understand the nuance between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges and evaluate the analyst's statement from that perspective. Furthermore, while the lead of the article does raise concerns regarding journalistic accuracy and grammatical appeal, rephrasing it can improve its overall quality. Please feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or require further clarification on this topic.

I was intrigued with how cool the place seemed overall but a bit apprehensive since she has steered me down the wrong path once. At this place, they offered a bunch of typical breakfast fare with a sort of a modern fusion twist. That is the best that I can describe it. Be prepared, the portions are HUGE! I like to think that I have a hearty appetite, but this is enough to share for two--at least for breakfast. Dinner or lunch might be a bit different. SERVICE We showed up on a Monday morning and the place was hopping at 10:30. We didn't have to wait too long before our table became readily available. Overall, the service was great and friendly. We were checked upon often and coffee cups were always refilled. FOOD The food was really good and impressed with how fresh things tasted. No Krusteaz Costco pancake mix here! Here is a breakdown of what we ordered. - Banana Brown Sugar Pancake: Holy moly! They serve up a whopping huge pancake that is almost served up on a serving platter. I would say that the pancake is about 1.5 feet in diameter. My husband could only tear through about half of it. The brown sugar was a nice touch as it was added to the top of the pancake and then browned to almost caramel. OH! They also have different flavors of pancakes, different fruits, coconut mango, snickers and more! - Bacon Waffle: If you are a fan of the salty sweet. This is a must try. When I ordered it, I thought that there would be sprinkles of bacon throughout the waffle. Instead, there were actual strips which crisscrossed throughout the waffle. Fancy. TIP #1: Come hungry.

Which entity is this text about? Haruki Murakami (Cun Shang Chun Shu , Murakami Haruki, born January 12, 1949) is a Japanese writer. His books and stories have been bestsellers in Japan as well as internationally, with his work being translated into 50 languages and selling millions of copies outside his native country. The critical acclaim for his fiction and non-fiction has led to numerous awards, in Japan and internationally, including the World Fantasy Award (2006) and the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award (2006). His oeuvre received, for example, the Franz Kafka Prize (2006) and the Jerusalem Prize (2009). Sputnik Sweetheart was first published in 1999, followed by Kafka on the Shore in 2002, with the English translation following in 2005. Kafka on the Shore won the World Fantasy Award for Novels in 2006. The English version of his novel After Dark was released in May 2007. It was chosen by The New York Times as a \\"notable book of the year\\". In late 2005, Murakami published a collection of short stories titled Tokyo Kitanshu, or Dong Jing Qi Tan Ji , which translates loosely as \\"Mysteries of Tokyo.\\" A collection of the English versions of twenty-four short stories, titled Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, was published in August 2006. This collection includes both older works from the 1980s as well as some of Murakami's more recent short stories, including all five that appear in Tokyo Kitanshu. In 2002, Murakami published the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short stories on the theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Shinchosha Publishing published Murakami's novel 1Q84 in Japan on May 29, 2009. 1Q84 is pronounced \\"ichi kyu hachi yon\\", the same as 1984, as 9 is also pronounced \\"kyu\\" in Japanese. The book was longlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2011. However, after the 2012 anti-Japanese demonstrations in China, Murakami's books were removed from sale there, along with those of other Japanese authors. Murakami criticized the China-Japan political territorial dispute, characterizing the overwrought nationalistic response as \\"cheap liquor\\" which politicians were giving to the public. In April 2013, he published his novel \\"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\\". It became an international best seller but received mixed reviews.","completion":"This text is about Haruki Murakami, a famous Japanese writer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Professor Kristan's mother was bitten by a vampire bat in Africa while she was hiding in a cave along with a group of explorers. The context reveals that she was pregnant at the time of the bite, and due to the events that unfolded in the film, it is suggested that the traits of vampirism were passed down to her son, Professor Kristan, through Lamarckism.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

In the latest case, one of the two women found early Christmas Day in the trunk of a car that had been set afire was identified as Vernithea McCrary, 28, the investigator said. The second victim remains unidentified, said the investigator, who asked not to be identified because he is not allowed to speak on the record to the news media. The bodies of two other women found December 19 have been identified as Demesha Hunt, 24, and Renisha Landers, 23. They were found in the trunk of Landers' Chrysler 300. Causes of death for the four women were pending toxicology results, which typically take six to eight weeks to be completed, the investigator said. The process of identification can be difficult. \\"People hear of someone that is discovered that we bring down here and they call down here and inform us that someone is missing,\\" the investigator said. \\"They give us a description and then they come down if they can be viewed and are recognizable. If not, we ask them to bring a set of dental records for comparison.\\" The deaths are being treated as the work of one person or group of people, Detroit's police chief said Tuesday. \\"At this point, we are working it as one case or one suspect or set of suspects,\\" Chief Ralph L.

With him is his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: 1634: The Bavarian Crisis, precededBy, \\"DeMarce short stories in the The Grantville Gazettes\\". Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided refers to a historical event, a book, and associated short stories which are all set within the same literary universe. In order to offer a comprehensive understanding of this information, it is necessary to explore each aspect individually and then establish their connection to each other. 1. 1634: The Bavarian Crisis This historical event is the backdrop for a novel of the same name, written by Virginia DeMarce and Eric Flint. Published in 2007 as part of the 1632 book series, which Flint kicked off in 2000, the novel is an alternate history tale that presents a divergent course of European history. Set in the year 1634, this particular novel focuses on the various political and military challenges faced by the European countries during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). The key plot driver is a crisis in Bavaria, which reaches its climax when an attempt to abduct the Swedish queen, Maria Eleonora, fails. 2. Preceded By: DeMarce Short Stories in the Grantville Gazettes The data suggests that 1634: The Bavarian Crisis is preceded by short stories written by Virginia DeMarce that have appeared in the \\"Grantville Gazettes\\". The Grantville Gazettes, edited by Eric Flint, are official online magazines which allow both established and new authors to contribute short stories, articles, and essays set within the 1632 book series universe. These short stories provide readers with additional context and background information for the main novel series. In this case, specific short stories from the Gazettes written by DeMarce have likely laid the groundwork for the events and characters depicted in \\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\". 3. Connection Between the Data Points The connection between the historical event (\\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\") and the short stories by Virginia DeMarce in the Grantville Gazettes can be analyzed from two perspectives: a. Chronological Link: The short stories by DeMarce in the Grantville Gazettes logically precede the events in 1634: The Bavarian Crisis, providing valuable background information and setting the stage for the novel. In this sense, readers who have been following the Gazettes would apprehend the events in the book with increased clarity and understanding thanks to the familiarity gained from the short stories. b. Literary Collaboration: Eric Flint and Virginia DeMarce have a history of collaboration within the 1632 book series universe. Flint is the series creator, while DeMarce has been a contributing author to several volumes, including the Bavarian Crisis. The short stories in the Grantville Gazettes, therefore, also serve as a platform for DeMarce to hone her craft and establish her unique voice within the series. Moreover, it is an opportunity for the two authors to collaborate further and build the rich alternate historical universe introduced in the main 1632 series. In conclusion, the data provided encompasses a historical event (\\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\") from an alternate history novel co-written by Eric Flint and Virginia DeMarce, which in turn is preceded by a series of short stories contributed by DeMarce in the \\"Grantville Gazettes.\\" These short stories extend the depth and detail of the 1632 universe and influence the progression of the main novel series, with special emphasis on \\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\" as a pivotal moment in this fascinating alternate-history reinterpretation of early modern Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maneuvering slowly through grassy Cambodian terrain, a caravan of 20 men and women is on a search-and-rescue mission. Dressed in military fatigues, they are guided by a fearless leader who calculates every step and ensures the safest path for his comrades. It takes just minutes for the unit to confront the first of many hidden targets: a muddied 20-year-old land mine buried a few inches beneath the ground. \\"This is an active land mine made from Russia. [If] we step on [it] ... it explodes and cuts the leg off,\\" says Aki Ra, leader of the Cambodian Self Help Demining team. He and his group are working to make their country safer by clearing land mines -- many of which Aki Ra planted himself years ago. Aki Ra, a Cambodian native who does not recall his birth year, was a child soldier during the communist Khmer Rouge regime, a genocidal crusade responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Cambodians during the 1970s. He was raised by the army after being separated from his family during the internal conflict. Around age 10, Aki Ra estimates, he was given a rifle that measured his own height. Soon after, he was taught to lay land mines. For three years, Aki Ra worked as a mine layer for the Khmer Rouge. He then did the same job for the Vietnamese army that overthrew his village. \\"I maybe planted 4,000 to 5,000 land mines in a [single] month,\\" said Aki Ra, who says he's about 40 years old now. \\"We planted them all over the place.\\" Watch a slideshow of some young land-mine victims Aki Ra has helped. According to the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, an estimated 4 million to 6 million land mines were laid in Cambodia during three decades of conflict. The mines were planted to defend strategic military locations, target warring opponents and deny the use of roads. \\"I had [bad] feelings, because sometimes we were fighting against our friends and relatives,\\" Aki Ra said. \\"I felt sad when I saw a lot of people were killed. A lot of people were suffering from land mines. [But] I did not know what to do, [because] we were under orders.\\" Approximately 63,000 civilians and soldiers have been in accidents involving land mines and other explosive weapons, according to the Cambodian Mine Victim Information System. Nearly 19,000 of them were killed. Today, Cambodia reportedly has one amputee for every 290 people, one of the highest ratios in the world. When the United Nations came in the early 1990s to help restore peace to Cambodia, Aki Ra saw an opportunity to begin undoing the damage he and others had done. He started training with the U.N. and helping them clear mines. It was around this time he got the name he goes by today. He was born Eoun Yeak, but he was so skilled at clearing mines that his supervisors began comparing him to AKIRA, a heavy-duty appliance company in Japan. One reportedly commented, \\"He works just like an AKIRA.\\" The name stuck. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes. In 1993, one year after working with the U.N., Aki Ra decided to begin clearing mines alone. \\"Some of the areas I was clearing were places where I used to plant mines before,\\" he said. \\"I didn't have any equipment. ... I clear by knife, by stick.\\" For Aki Ra, this bare-hands technique \\"wasn't dangerous. It was easy.\\" But easy didn't mean legal. The method was not in accordance with international standards, which requires protective gear and other professional equipment. So in 2005, he went to the United Kingdom to receive formal training and accreditation. In 2008, Aki Ra formed his nonprofit demining organization. Comprised of native Cambodians, it includes former soldiers and war crime victims. One of the workers is an amputee who lost a leg to a land mine. \\"[Our] goal is to clear land mines in rural villages for the people who need the land for building houses or farming or building schools,\\" Aki Ra said. Aki Ra and his organization devote all of their donated funds to clearing Cambodia's rural \\"low-priority\\" villages. These villages, populated primarily by poor farmers, do not always receive first dibs for minefield clearance projects because of their remoteness and limited traffic. At times, they're completely overlooked. \\"Villagers report land mines every day, and they ask us to destroy [them],\\" Aki Ra said. \\"The people are afraid of mines. Whether there are a lot of land mines or only a few, [we] still have to clear the area so that the people in the village can be safe.\\" Kuot Visoth, chief of Prey Thom village, was relieved when the team arrived in early July to clear his village. \\"I know the area around the school has a lot of land mines, and I am afraid that when the children come to school and play, they will step on them, or the villagers' buffaloes grazing in the area would be killed,\\" Visoth said. Aki Ra estimates that he and his group have cleared more than 50,000 land mines and unexploded war weapons such as bombs and grenades. The Cambodian government says there are 3 million to 5 million mines still undiscovered. Many of Aki Ra's recovered land mines and unexploded weapons are on display at a museum in Siem Reap. For 2, visitors can touch defused mines and bombs as well as AK-47 rifles and war uniforms. \\"I had an idea to open a land mine museum to teach people to understand about war, land mines,\\" he said. \\"Even though the war [is] finished, [these explosives] still kill people, and the land cannot be used.\\" Also at the museum is an orphanage that Aki Ra and his wife, Hourt, opened about a decade ago. Roughly 100 children, some injured by land mines, have been cared for over the years. The orphanage provides food and shelter for the children and sends them to public school. \\"I brought them to the museum because I could provide them with [a] better situation,\\" Aki Ra said. \\"If I didn't help them, they would have a very difficult life.\\" The orphanage's first resident, Sot \\"Tol\\" Visay, lost a leg to a mine. He was living on the street when Aki Ra was demining in his province. Aki Ra offered Visay a home, and Visay has spent the past seven years living there. \\"This place has been very good to me,\\" said Visay, now 21. \\"Mr. Aki Ra does not want anything from me. Instead, he encourages all people here to study, to gain knowledge.\\" Hourt died last year from a stroke, leaving Aki Ra to care for his three biological children and 27 orphans ages 10 to 20.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Gothic Revival (also referred to as Victorian Gothic, Neo-Gothic or Jigsaw Gothic, and when used for school, college, and university buildings as Collegiate Gothic) is an architectural movement that began in the late 1740s in England. Its popularity grew rapidly in the early 19th century, when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture, in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time. Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style, including decorative patterns, finials, scalloping, lancet windows, hood mouldings, and label stops. - A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object, often formed to be a decorative feature. In architecture it is a decorative device, typically carved in stone, employed decoratively to emphasize the apex of a dome, spire, tower, roof, or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top, end, or corner of a building or structure. Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles. Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture. These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks. Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades, and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons. The charm at the end of a pull chain (such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp) is also known as a finial. - Collegiate Gothic was an architectural style subgenre of Gothic Revival architecture, popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for college and high school buildings in the United States and Canada, and to a certain extent Europe. A form of historicist architecture, it took its inspiration from English Tudor and Gothic buildings. - Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as \\"\\" (\\"French work\\") with the term \\"Gothic\\" first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms. - A lancet window is a tall, narrow window with a pointed arch at its top. It acquired the \\"lancet\\" name from its resemblance to a lance. Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period. Lancet windows may occur singly, or paired under a single moulding, or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre. - Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .

We have: 4191 * o + 1991 = 4242 * o + 614 First, we want to get all the \\"o\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do that, let's subtract 4191 * o from both sides: 1991 = (4242 - 4191) * o + 614 Now, it looks like this: 1991 = 51 * o + 614 Next, let's move the 614 to the left side by subtracting it from both sides: (1991 - 614) = 51 * o This becomes: 1377 = 51 * o Now, we just need to find out what \\"o\\" is. To do that, divide both sides by 51: 1377 ÷ 51 = o This gives us: 27 = o So, the answer is o = 27. That means if you replace \\"o\\" with 27, both sides of the equation would be equal!

Q: Text: first post ever... technically this fuck up took place last night. at least i think it was before midnight... this fuck up starts as i was finishing my shift at the pub yesterday. we get a complimentary shift drink and meal for every shift we work. and since i work in the kitchen, i \\"sample\\" almost all the meals i cook. so after snacking all day, i was thirsty. really thirsty! i usually have a beer or maybe a shot of whiskey before i go home and have my daily six pack. usually... but yesterday was different. it was my friday. and there were some exceptionally generous customers hanging out. said generous customers decided that instead of just one drink, i needed three. i came up with a delicious concoction of tequila, orange juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice and tropical redbull. and since i know the bartender, it's always a little heavy on the tequila. fast forward to not wanting to go home and drink alone. i called a female friend i've know most of my adult life. she and her husband are hosting a gaggle of house guests. including his brother, his brothers wife and their three kids. bed time rolls around and all six kids go to their crashing post. all's well so far. the adults go out back and smoke a bowl and a cigarette. we all have a beer or glass of wine. so far it's a pretty chill evening. then my buddy remembers that he has a bottle in the freezer and demands we all do shots with him... this is about checkout time for me! i vaguely remember taking that one shot. i wake up at around 4am on their couch with a small baby blanket over my legs. and decide that it's a good time for me to slip out since i undoubtedly was snoring like a rhino after i passed out. foggy headed, i drive the short distance home, strip and fall into my own bed. successful friday night done and over without major catastrophe... or so i thought. i wake up at 8 and text my female friend thanking her for the blanket and apologizing for passing out on her couch. she has a new baby so she generally doesn't respond unless a response is required or prompted. today was different. immediately she replies: \\"you're a fucking punk! you owe me!!\\" i was a little more than confused... how much could have happened after i stopped remembering things?? well... after we took that shot, they broke out their new set of cards against humanity. and we did what any self respecting adults full of booze and weed would do. we sat at the kitchen table and played a wholesome game of cards. none of this is within my memory. so after texting her for a bit, i discover that at one point, i whipped out my member and was showing it to the group. as if that isn't embarrassing enough... shortly before i passed out, i whipped it out for a second time. this time it wasn't to show it off. this time i had to piss. i threw my cards at the table, got up, whipped it out, and pissed right there at the base of the chair i was just sitting in. to make things worse, i pissed on the cards that weren't fortunate enough to actually land on the table. supposedly i turned my back and went straight to the couch. leaving everyone stunned and horrified by what i had just done. update: talked to my friends... they weren't happy about my stunt. although they assured me that it was only 11:00pm when i passed out. and my short drive home was less than 6 blocks. i'm sure that if i'd been stopped by a police officer, i would have been in trouble for duii. i've always know reddit to be a generally kind and caring community... but never expected so much kind and concerned advice from complete strangers. thank you reddit! i've known for some time now that i am indeed an alcoholic. you're kind words and the sheer embarrassment of my actions have brought me to the conclusion that i need to stop drinking. but i know myself well enough to know that i will not be able to turn it off over night. i have been alcohol free since that night. and am giving up all hard alcohol. from now on, i will be a beer only man. this far in life, i've never been able to consume enough beer to act the way i did that night. i know it's not a perfect plan. but it's the first attempt at what will certainly be a long road. thanks again reddit!

Please answer the following question: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of this process, which describes the formation of fossils through a method called permineralization, is the eventual solidification of the minerals and uncovering of the fossil after millions of years. To elaborate on this final step, after the organic materials of the remains have decomposed and left only trace amounts, minerals carried by groundwater gradually infiltrate the pores and cavities within the plant or animal's remains. Over time, these minerals precipitate and begin to solidify, effectively turning the organic remains into stone. This process preserves the original structure of the remains, creating a detailed fossil that can provide valuable information about the organism's appearance, behavior, and environment. As sediment continues to accumulate on top of the fossil, pressure and heat gradually increase, facilitating further mineralization of the remains and helping to solidify the surrounding rock. Over the course of millions of years, the various layers of sediment may transform into sedimentary rock, such as sandstone, limestone, or shale. Tectonic forces and natural erosional processes (e.g., rain, wind, glaciers, and the actions of rivers and oceans) can eventually expose the fossil to the surface—either by uplifting the rock layers or by eroding away the overlying material. At this point, the fossil may be discovered by happenstance or through targeted scientific expeditions. In summary, the last step in the permineralization process is the solidification of the mineral deposits that have replaced the organism's remains and the eventual uncovering of the fossil through geological forces and erosional processes. This culmination of the fossilization process reveals a beautiful and informative snapshot of the planet's ancient history, preserving vital information about extinct species and past ecosystems for future generations to study and appreciate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Okay, let me explain this in a simple way for you. Alexis de Tocqueville was a man from France who lived a long time ago, from 1805 to 1859. He was important because he thought a lot about how people can live together and help each other, especially in big groups like in a country. He wrote two very famous books. The first book was called \\"Democracy in America.\\" He wrote it after visiting the United States. In this book, he tried to explain why people in America could live happily and peacefully even though they come from different places. He also looked at how people can work together to make decisions. The second book was called \\"The Old Regime and the Revolution.\\" In this book, he talked about a big event in France called the French Revolution. He thought that the reason why it happened was because people wanted to change how their country was run, but they didn't know exactly how to do it. Tocqueville believed in something called \\"parliamentary government,\\" which means having a group of people who talk together and make decisions for everyone in the country. He thought that too much democracy, where everyone makes decisions, might not always be the best thing. So, basically, Alexis de Tocqueville was a smart man who wrote books to help people understand how to live together happily and peacefully in a big group like a country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It doesn’t matter if you’re in your own backyard or paddling through the islands of Papua New Guinea – a good explorer is always on the lookout. If you're not, you'll go through the time spent on your trip not coming back with a thing. This project is all about being attentive. If you're going with a team, make sure you're utilizing numbers as much as possible. Everyone should have their own area they're covering to make sure no stone goes unturned. In exploring, it’s a good idea to have a plan. However, will you stick to that plan? Likely never. When you notice something intriguing that takes you away from it, go for it. It’s sometimes the littlest of things that lead to the biggest adventures. This is where your mapping and tracking skills will come in handy. When you go off course, you'll need to be able to get yourself back on it. Be sure you leave a trail you can take back, and/or plot your new course on a map as accurately as possible. What good is exploring if you come back and can’t fully remember what you’ve seen, heard, and done? You want to keep your memories as vivid as possible – so write it down! You'll need these for the project when you get back. Make charts, too. They're vivid and more illustrative of what it is you're experiencing – and they're quicker than writing out an essay about every little detail you're seeing. You can also reference these later to look for anomalies and patterns. Take time out of the day (or night) to do this. You don’t want to constantly have your head stuck in a book – or you might miss exactly what it is you went looking for. Take a broken branch on the ground. On the outside, it’s pretty insignificant. But if you actually think about where it came from and how it got there, it can lead you to a number of conclusions. Is a wild animal nearby? Was there a fierce storm recently? Is the tree dying? Take even the smallest things, put them together, and you may find answers. This trip, in the end, will be about conclusions. You'll need to take everything you've seen and piece it together until it becomes one giant, coherent puzzle (ideally, of course). In piecing it together, you'll be able to see what sticks out and deserves attention. In addition to going out there with gusto and taking the world by storm, sometimes you just have to sit back and let it take you by storm. Be still. Observe.

Premise: \\"They want coal and oil.\\"\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels.\\" true? Options: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","completion":"(i) Yes Based on the premise \\"They want coal and oil,\\" it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels\\" is true. Here's a detailed explanation as to why this is the case. Fossil fuels are a category of energy sources that were formed from the remnants of ancient plants and animals over millions of years. The most well-known and widely used fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy sources derive their energy from the sun and are released when they are burned. In the premise, it is stated that \\"they\\" want coal and oil, which are both types of fossil fuels. The specific mention of coal and oil implies an interest in energy sources that belong to the category of fossil fuels. There are no other sources of energy mentioned in the premise, so it is safe to assume that the interest is exclusively in fossil fuels. The hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels\\" encompasses the desire for coal and oil, as these are two prime examples of fossil fuel energy sources. When considering that these energy sources are being sought out in the premise, it strengthens the validity of the hypothesis. Moreover, the premise narrows down explicitly which fossil fuels \\"they\\" want, further supporting the idea that the overarching hypothesis is accurate. Since coal and oil are both mentioned, and there is no indication that any other energy sources are being considered, the hypothesis can be considered true based on the given information. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"They want coal and oil,\\" the hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels\\" is true. The specific mention of coal and oil supports the hypothesis, as both of these energy sources fall under the category of fossil fuels. Without any conflicting information or mention of alternative energy sources, it is safe to assume that the hypothesis is accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt . In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male.

Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.","completion":"Tim, who studied males during puberty, observed that the growth spurt is triggered by testosterone.

Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama.

Say this using Spanish","completion":"Con los conflictos ahora internacionalizados, es necesario buscar mecanismos democráticos a nivel planetario. En los tiempos actuales, donde los problemas y desafíos ya no se limitan a las fronteras nacionales, es fundamental reinventar y adaptar los sistemas democráticos existentes para abordar estos asuntos de manera más eficiente y sostenible. Uno de los primeros pasos para lograr esto es promover la cooperación y el diálogo entre los países y sus líderes. El establecimiento de foros globales, donde las distintas naciones puedan expresar y discutir sus inquietudes y objetivos, puede ayudar en la creación de soluciones multilaterales y consensuadas. Además, es vital que haya una mayor participación ciudadana en la toma de decisiones internacionales. Facilitar la involucración de la sociedad civil en organismos internacionales, como las Naciones Unidas y sus múltiples organismos, permitiría a los ciudadanos influir en las políticas y regulaciones que afectan a todo el planeta. También es esencial promover la educación y la concienciación sobre los asuntos globales entre la población, para que las personas puedan tomar decisiones informadas en cuestiones que trascienden las fronteras nacionales. Una alternativa para garantizar una representación más equilibrada de los intereses a nivel mundial es la creación de instituciones supranacionales democráticas. Estas organizaciones podrían concentrarse en áreas específicas y funcionar de manera similar a los sistemas democráticos nacionales, pero abordando cuestiones en una escala global, tales como el medio ambiente, la economía y la justicia social. Asimismo, debemos recordar que una democracia planetaria no puede ser uniforme en todos los países, sino que debe ser inclusiva y respetuosa de las diferencias culturales, políticas y sociales existentes en el mundo. Es importante buscar y diseñar modelos democráticos adaptativos, que puedan integrar la diversidad de enfoques, valores y sistemas de gobierno sin imponer un único modelo ideal. Por último, no debemos olvidar el papel de las tecnologías en este proceso. La era de la información y la comunicación ofrece una oportunidad única para replantear y mejorar los sistemas democráticos existentes. La creación de plataformas digitales y el uso de herramientas tecnológicas para facilitar y ampliar la participación ciudadana a nivel global, podría permitir un acercamiento más directo y accesible a la democracia planetaria. En resumen, en una época donde los conflictos y desafíos trascienden las fronteras nacionales, resulta imprescindible buscar y poner en marcha mecanismos democráticos que permitan abordar estos asuntos a nivel planetario. La cooperación internacional, la participación ciudadana, el respeto a la diversidad, el fortalecimiento de instituciones supranacionales y el aprovechamiento de las tecnologías son aspectos clave en este proceso de construcción de una democracia planetaria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place.

Article: In 1969, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross published a book called \\"Death and Dying\\" about her work with terminally ill patients. She developed a model for what she called the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Everyone grieves differently, and these stages do not necessarily unfold in a set order—but the model may give you perspective on your own process. The first reaction to learning of the death of a loved one is to deny the reality of the situation. It is a normal reaction to rationalize overwhelming emotions; indeed, denial is a defense mechanism that dulls the immediate shock. This carries you through the first wave of pain and bewilderment. As the masking effects of denial begin to wear down, you may be flooded by the painful reality of the situation. If you aren't ready for this pain, you may subconsciously deflect it toward others: friends, family, strangers, or inanimate objects. Try to maintain perspective and recognize this deflection. You can't help what you feel, but you choose whether or not to let these feelings control you. Many people react to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability by attempting to regain control. In terminal patients, this often takes the form of desperate measures to cling to life. In mourning, this often manifests as rumination: If only I had been there for her... If only we had gotten to the hospital sooner... If only, if only, if only. When the desperate bargaining subsides, you may be unable to avoid the reality of the situation. You may worry about the cost of the burial or feel an acute sense of regret. You may feel empty, sad, alone; you may despair at ever moving on with your life. This is part of the healing process. Take your time. The final stage of grief unfolds as you begin to move on. This stage is characterized by withdrawal and calm. Accept that your loved one has moved on, and acknowledge that you, too, must move on. Embrace the present as the new reality, and come to terms with the permanence of what has happened. Acceptance does not happen overnight. It does not necessarily mean that you are happy—only that you have moved beyond the denial, the anger, the bargaining, and the depression. Just like a forest that has burned slowly heals, sprouts, and blooms again, your life will bloom again with new hope. Give it time. What is a summary?","completion":"In 1969, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross introduced the five stages of grief in her book \\"Death and Dying.\\" The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, and they offer perspective on the grieving process.

Often, the hardest part about opening up to your parents is starting the conversation. Take some time and decide what you want to say.","completion":"If you are a teenager experiencing emotional or mental health challenges, seeking therapy can be an important step in improving your well-being. As a teen, it can be challenging to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and concerns to others, particularly your parents. Here are some steps you can follow to seek therapy and open a discussion with your parents: 1. Reflect on your reasons for seeking therapy: Whether you are struggling with anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues, or relationship problems, take some time to honestly evaluate your thoughts and feelings. Understanding your specific needs for therapy can help you communicate your concerns more effectively to your parents. 2. Do your research: Before you speak to your parents, do some research on different types of therapy that may be beneficial for you. This could include individual counseling, group therapy, or specific treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). If possible, also gather information on local therapists, their specialties, and potential costs. 3. Choose the right time, place, and setting: Plan when and where you would like to have this conversation with your parents. Choose a comfortable and quiet place where you won't be interrupted. It's also essential to pick a time when your parents are likely to be relaxed and receptive. 4. Communicate with honesty and openness: In your conversation, try to express your feelings as honestly as possible. You may want to use \\"I\\" statements to describe your emotions, thoughts, and experiences. Be prepared to provide examples of situations or instances that have led you to believe therapy can be beneficial. 5. Be persistent: It's possible that your parents may not immediately understand or support your decision to seek therapy. If this is the case, remain calm and continue to communicate your reasons for wanting to speak to a professional. It might take some time for them to accept and support your decision, so be patient. 6. Address concerns and ask for support: Your parents may have questions about the therapy process or may not fully understand why you need therapy. Recognize and address their concerns. Explain the potential benefits of therapy and how it can help you work through your issues. Request their support during your therapy journey, whether that support comes in the form of locating a suitable therapist, setting appointments, or helping with finances. 7. Make a plan together: If your parents are supportive of your decision, work together to find a therapist that is right for you. Discuss logistics such as the frequency of sessions, transportation, and how therapy will be financed. 8. Follow up: Keep the lines of communication open with your parents as you embark on your therapy journey. Update them on your progress and share your experiences. This will not only help to maintain their support but also keep them involved in your emotional and mental well-being. Remember that seeking therapy as a teenager is a brave and responsible act. By following these steps, you can effectively communicate with your parents and gain their support in taking control of your mental health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Caroline, Countess of Derby is one of Baron Braybrooke's daughters. Undoubtedly the Earl of Grantham would sympathise with his predicament. An elderly baron with eight daughters and a 6,000-acre estate faces his title being passed to a distant cousin – because he has no sons. The dilemma echoes the plot of ITV series Downton Abbey, where the Earl of Grantham grapples with the problem of having three daughters but no male heir. But in the real-life drama, the case of the 10th Baron Braybrooke has prompted a campaign to change the ancient law that stops daughters from inheriting titles. Peers are asking the Government – which is already legislating so that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s firstborn is a girl she can accede the throne – to make an amendment to the rules covering hereditary titles. His eldest daughter, Amanda Murray, scaled down her business as an interior designer to take over the reins at the vast estate. But when her father dies, his title – created in 1788 – will pass to a distant cousin she has never met, because peerages can only go to male heirs. Mrs Murray, 50, said she was aware the predicament of herself and her sisters – who include Caroline, Countess of Derby – might arouse public irritation rather than sympathy, but added: ‘It boils down to this: if I was a boy, I would be sitting pretty. ‘My poor father had no son, just lots of daughters. In this day and age, with supposed equality, why am I not allowed to inherit my father’s title? It is discriminatory. ‘I am managing the estate, including the steam railway, so I am already doing a man’s job.’ It was a similar scenario in the ITV drama when the Earl of Grantham, played by Hugh Bonneville, was horrified to discover that Downton Abbey would pass on his death to distant cousin – and ‘country solicitor’ – Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens. But in the series, the problem was solved when Matthew fell in love with and married Lady Mary, the eldest of the Earl’s three daughters. A similar problem also affected Elizabeth Bennett and her four sisters in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. They faced being left penniless because, with no male heir, their fortune was due to pass to cousin William Collins, whom none of them wanted to marry. In real life, upon the 10th Baron Braybrooke’s death his title will pass to Richard Neville, a fourth cousin once removed. Mr Neville, 35, is single and owns a flat above a hairdressing salon in South-West London. Mrs Murray said she knew nothing about him, although Mr Neville has said he has met the baron and some of his other daughters, and rode on the Audley End miniature railway in the 1980s. The entrepreneur, who has a stake in events and venue website thehandbook.com, has declined to discuss the baronetcy. Real life dilemma: Baron Braybrooke (pictured centre with his wife, right, and one of his daughters, Amanda Murray second from left) will leave his estate to a distant cousin they barely know. Heir apparent: Richard Neville (pictured with an unknown woman), a fourth cousin once removed, is set to inherit the 6,000-acre estate. He currently lives in a flat above a hairdressing salon in South-West London. But while he will inherit the title, it remains unclear whether he will automatically gain ownership of the estate. Audley End is a 17th century country house and renowned as one of the finest Jacobean houses in England. It was requisitioned during the Second World War and used by the Special Operations Executive, the forerunner of MI6. Mrs Murray said her father had. examined whether the title could skip a generation and pass to her son,. who is 20 – but the law is clear that it may not. Stately home: The Jacobean-style Audley End House. Powerless: In Downton Abbey, the Earl of Grantham's daughters (pictured) cannot inherit the estate because they are girls. Heir: The character of Matthew Crawley (pictured) was set to inherit Downton Abbey, even though he is a distant cousin.

He owns a huge estate, but when he dies, his title and possibly his estate will go to a distant cousin, not to his daughters. This is because of an old law that says only boys can inherit titles. Many people think this law is not fair because girls should be allowed to inherit titles too. This situation is similar to the story in the TV show Downton Abbey, where the daughters cannot inherit their father's title. Baron Braybrooke's daughters, including Caroline, Countess of Derby, think the law should be changed to let girls inherit titles as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. I am facing a new situation today: John is a soil scientist. He has been studying the lands near Mississippi delta. He noticed cases of hypoxia in that are. He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B.

Answer choices: - Heat energy - The darkness it gets - The bending of a ray of light - The tilt of the axis - The tilt of the sun's axis - electromagnetic energy - The brightness of the earth - rain or sun shine A:","completion":"The amount of daylight Earth gets is primarily determined by the tilt of the Earth's axis. This tilt, which is approximately 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun, is responsible for the varying daylight hours we experience throughout the year. The tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight during the course of its orbit, leading to the change in daylight hours and the changing seasons. Here's a breakdown of the answer choices: - Heat energy: While heat energy from the Sun does play a role in Earth's climate, it does not directly determine the amount of daylight Earth gets. - The darkness it gets: The amount of darkness is determined by the absence of daylight, so this is not a direct determinant of the amount of daylight. - The bending of a ray of light: Light bending occurs due to the Earth's atmosphere, but it does not significantly impact the overall amount of daylight the Earth receives. - The tilt of the axis (correct answer): As mentioned earlier, the tilt of Earth's axis is the primary factor influencing the amount of daylight received. - The tilt of the sun's axis: This has no direct impact on the amount of daylight Earth gets. - Electromagnetic energy: While sunlight is a form of electromagnetic energy, this term is broader than just sunlight and does not directly determine the amount of daylight Earth gets. - The brightness of the earth: Earth's brightness or albedo can affect how much solar radiation is absorbed or reflected back into space, but it doesn't determine the amount of daylight. - Rain or sunshine: These are weather conditions and do not determine the amount of daylight Earth receives. In summary, the tilt of the Earth's axis is the main factor that determines the amount of daylight Earth gets. It causes variations in sunlight exposure and leads to changing seasons, with longer days in summer and shorter days in winter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In June 2009, Ray Davies told The Independent that while a full-fledged reunion was unlikely, \\"I will continue to play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time. With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again.\\" When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, \\"A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well.\\" In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had \\"eight tracks\\" ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66. Two days after the bassist's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing deep sorrow over the passing of his former band mate and stating that Quaife \\"was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [sic] [with The Kinks]\\".

Who appeared as Jareth in the film Labyrinth? Answer the above question based on the context below: Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...","completion":"The English musician and actor David Bowie appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth. Directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas, the movie was a unique collaboration between these creative talents. In addition to his acting role, Bowie also contributed to the film's soundtrack by writing and performing five songs. In the 1980s, Bowie was involved in a variety of projects that showcased his diverse interests and talents. Along with film work and music collaborations with other artists such as Tina Turner and Iggy Pop, Bowie released several successful albums like Tonight (1984) and Never Let Me Down (1987). Although his performance as Jareth in Labyrinth was not his first acting role, it is considered one of his most iconic and memorable parts. Here, Bowie played a powerful and enigmatic character who ruled over a labyrinthine world filled with strange creatures and puzzling challenges. He used his unique voice, commanding presence, and magnetic charisma to bring the character to life, making Jareth both captivating and repellant, as well as undeniably appealing. In terms of Bowie's career, his work on Labyrinth represented a successful fusion of his musical and acting talents. Furthermore, it demonstrated his willingness to branch out into different artistic mediums and genres. Although the film was not a major box office hit upon its release, it achieved cult status over time and continues to resonate with audiences today. Bowie's captivating portrayal of Jareth is a significant reason for Labyrinth's enduring appeal, and the film remains an important part of his artistic legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The two-day funeral was planned by Ali in the years before his death, according to a family spokesman. Ali wanted the Muslim prayer service, known as a Jenazah, to be \\"a teaching moment\\", according to Imam Zaid Shakir, who led the service. Muhammad Ali, \\"The Greatest\\", died on Friday aged 74. More than 14,000 people had tickets to the event at the site of Ali's last fight in Louisville in 1961. Obituary: Muhammad Ali The man who changed his sport and country Muhammad Ali - in his own words World pays tribute to boxing legend Ali's love affair with Africa American Muslims attending the service and watching on TV said they hoped that the public prayers would help Americans to become more familiar with Islam and its practices. In 1964, Ali famously converted to Islam, changing his name from Cassius Clay, which he called his \\"slave name\\". He first joined the Nation of Islam, a controversial black separatist movement, before later converting to mainstream Islam. He travelled the world as a boxer and speaker, and inspired Muslims around the world. Abdul Rafay Basheer, 25, travelled from Chicago for the service and said he saw Ali as an ambassador for Muslims. He said the prayer service would help to demystify his religion. That was a theme taken up by Dawud Walid from the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \\"In a political climate in which Islamophobia is front and centre, his funeral will counterpunch the ridiculous notion that being a good Muslim and a good American are at odds,\\" he said. Ali \\"was willing to sacrifice the fame, the lights, the money, the glamour, all of that, for his beliefs and his principles,\\" Imam Shakir said in his address to the packed auditorium after reciting prayers over Ali's coffin. The funeral will continue on Friday with an interfaith memorial service and procession through Louisville passing key locations such as Ali's childhood home, and a museum dedicated to him. Tickets to attend the Friday service ran out only one hour after they became available. World leaders and celebrities will attend, including former US President Bill Clinton and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. President Barack Obama will not be able to attend due to his eldest daughter's graduation on the same day. Speaking after Jenazah prayers, Dr Sherman Jackson, an Islamic scholar, used a boxing term to describe how \\"Ali put the question of whether a person can be a Muslim and an American to rest. Indeed, he KO'ed that question.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Muhammad Ali was a famous boxer who passed away at 74 years old. Before he died, he planned a special two-day funeral for himself. The first part was a Muslim prayer service called Jenazah. Ali wanted this service to teach people about the Muslim religion. Ali was not always Muslim, but he converted in 1964 and changed his name from Cassius Clay. Many people hope that this special service will help others learn more about Islam and show that someone can be both Muslim and American at the same time. The next day, there will be a big memorial service and a procession through Louisville, where Ali grew up.

However, the legislature did not designate a state tree until 1949, when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support of the state forester, lobbied for formal recognition. Schoolchildren also chose the western meadowlark as the state bird, in a 1930 vote, and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931. Similarly, the secretary of state sponsored a children's vote in 1981 to choose a state animal, and after 74 animals were nominated, the grizzly bear won over the elk by a 2–1 margin.

In the first sentence, \\"Forward Rob Blake was replaced by defender Patrick Marleau as team captain\\", it states that Rob Blake, who is a forward player, was replaced by Patrick Marleau, who is a defender player, in the position of team captain.

William James, the great psychologist , said that most men are \\"old fogies at twenty-five\\". He was right. Most men at twenty-five are satisfied with their jobs. They have closed their minds to all new ideas; they have stopped to grow. The minute a man stops to grow -no matter what his years -that minute he begins to be old. On the other hand, the really great man never grows old. Goethe passed away at eighty-three, and finished his only a few years earlier; Gladstone took up a new language when he was seventy. Laplace, the astronomer, was still at work when death caught up with him at seventy-eight. He died crying, \\"What we know is nothing; what we do not know is immense (extremely large).\\" And there you have the real answer to the question, \\"When is a man old?\\" Laplace at seventy-eight died young. He was still unsatisfied, still sure that he had a lot to learn. As long as a man can keep himself in that attitude of mind, as long as he can look back on every year and say, \\"I grew\\", he is still young. The minute he ceases (stops) to grow, the minute he says to himself, \\"I know all that I need to know,\\" -that day youth stops. He may be twenty-five or seventy-five; it makes no difference. On that day he begins to be old. Answer the following questions: 1. Who is William James? 2. And what did he say about most men? 3. Is he right? 4. How so? 5. What about those who don't? 6. What did Gladstone do? 7. At what age? 8. How did Laplace feel when he died? 9. Why? 10. Did he believe that we knew anything?","completion":"1. William James is a renowned psychologist. 2. He said that most men are \\"old fogies at twenty-five,\\" meaning they have closed their minds to new ideas and stopped growing intellectually. 3. Yes, he is right in the sense that many people tend to become content with their knowledge and stop actively pursuing personal growth at a certain point in their lives, which can be as early as their mid-twenties. 4. This statement alludes to the fact that people often become satisfied with their jobs and current level of knowledge, which leads them to close their minds to new ideas and stop growing intellectually. 5. Those who don't fall into this category continue to learn, grow, and challenge themselves throughout their lives, remaining intellectually and mentally young. 6. Gladstone took up a new language. 7. He did this at the age of seventy. 8. Laplace felt a sense of dissatisfaction and a continued hunger for knowledge when he died. 9. This was because he believed there was still so much more to learn in his field, and he saw his own knowledge as lacking in comparison. 10. While Laplace acknowledged the knowledge he had accumulated, he also understood that it was minimal compared to the vast amount of knowledge still out there.

A mobile phone is a mobile phone. But can you combine the two to do something for your local environment? As early as next year it may well be possible. When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. \\"We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time.\\" said one scientist. As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them. Some 650 million mobile phones have been sold this year. Most of them will be thrown away within two years, adding plastic, heavy metal and chemical waste to the environment. A biodegradable cover can change this, according to the scientists. ,A, B, C, D,. (10) After you have finished using the new type of mobile phone, _ . A) the phone will do harm to the environment B) the phone cover will break down easily in the soil you bury it C) it will be recycled by the producers D) it can be sent back to the shops. A:","completion":"After you have finished using the new type of mobile phone, B) the phone cover will break down easily in the soil you bury it. Reasoning: The passage states that the new biodegradable mobile phone cover is designed to break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals, and when it turns into waste, it forms nitrates which help feed the seed and help the flower grow. This information aligns with option B, stating that the phone cover will break down easily in the soil when buried, and does not support options A, C, or D."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An effigy of President Barack Obama is burnt by Filipino activists during a rally as a 10-year pact was signed. The presence of foreign troops is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, a former American colony. The Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close down U.S. bases at Subic and Clark, northwest of Manila. However, it ratified a pact with the United States allowing temporary visits by American forces in 1999, four years after China seized a reef the Philippines contests. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, hundreds of U.S. forces descended in the southern Philippines under that accord to hold counter terrorism exercises with Filipino troops fighting Muslim militants. However this time, the focus of the Philippines and its underfunded military has increasingly turned to external threats as territorial spats with China in the potentially oil and gas-rich South China Sea heated up in recent years.

U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg and Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin signed the agreement at the main military camp in the capital, Manila, ahead of Obama's stop and portrayed it is as a central part of his weeklong Asia trip. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement will give American forces temporary access to selected military camps and allow them to preposition fighter jets and ships. The deal was signed hours before Obama arrived in Manila on the last leg of a four-country Asian tour, following stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Goldberg said the agreement will 'promote peace and security in the region,' and allow U.S. and Philippine forces to respond faster to disasters and other contingencies. It is not known how many additional U.S. troops would be deployed 'on temporary and rotational basis.'

With. its small military, the Philippines has struggled to bolster its. territorial defense amid China's increasingly assertive behavior in the. disputed South China Sea.

'The Philippines' immediate and urgent motivation is to strengthen itself and look for a security shield with its pitiful military,' Manila-based political analyst Ramon Casiple said. 'The U.S. is looking for a re-entry to Asia, where its superpower status has been put in doubt.' The convergence could work to deter China's increasingly assertive stance in disputed territories, Casiple said. However, it could further antagonise Beijing, which sees such tactical alliance as a U.S. strategy to contain its rise, and encourage China to intensify its massive military buildup, he said. Hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training and serve as advisers to Filipino soldiers, who have battled Muslim militants for decades.

The agreement says the U.S. will 'not establish a permanent military presence or base in the Philippines' in compliance with Manila's constitution. A Filipino base commander will have access to areas to be shared with American forces, according to the primer. Disagreements over Philippine access to designated U.S. areas within local camps hampered negotiations for the agreement last year. The agreement will increase coordination between U.S. and Filipino forces, boost the 120,000-strong Philippine military's capability to monitor and secure the country's territory and respond more rapidly to natural disasters and other emergencies. U.S. President Barack Obama reviews the honor guard with Philippines President Benigno Aquino III, left, at Malacanang Palace in Manila. While the U.S. military will not pay rent for local camp areas, the Philippines will own buildings and infrastructure to be built or improved by the Americans and reap economic gains from the U.S. presence, it has been said. Chinese paramilitary ships took effective control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground off the northwestern Philippines, in 2012. Last year, Chinese coast guard ships surrounded another contested offshore South China Sea territory, the Second Thomas Shoal, where they have been trying to block food supplies and rotation of Filipino marines aboard a grounded Philippine navy ship in the remote coral outcrops. China has ignored Philippine diplomatic protests and Manila's move last year to challenge Beijing's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea before an international arbitration tribunal.

The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west. - Winyah Bay is a coastal estuary that is the confluence of the Waccamaw River, the Pee Dee River, the Black River, and the Sampit River in Georgetown County, in eastern South Carolina. The historic port city of Georgetown is located on the bay, and the bay generally serves as the terminating point for the Grand Strand. - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. The state borders South Carolina and Georgia to the south, Tennessee to the west, Virginia to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. North Carolina is the 28th most extensive and the 9th most populous of the U.S. states. The state is divided into 100 counties. The capital is Raleigh. The most populous municipality is Charlotte, and it is the second largest banking center in the United States after New York City. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - The Grand Strand is a large stretch of beaches on the East Coast of the United States extending from Little River to Georgetown in the U.S. State of South Carolina. It consists of more than 60 miles along an essentially uninterrupted arc of beach land, beginning around the Little River and terminating at Winyah Bay. The population of the Grand Strand was 329,449 at the 2010 United States Census. - The Pee Dee River , also known as the Great Pee Dee River , is a river in North Carolina and South Carolina . It originates in the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina , where its upper course , above the mouth of the Uwharrie River is known as the Yadkin River . It is extensively dammed for flood control and hydroelectric power . The lower part of the river is named Pee Dee ( in colonial times written Pedee ) after the Native American Pee Dee tribe . The Pee Dee region of South Carolina , composed of the northeastern counties of the state , was named after the tribe and / or river . The first Europeans believed to have navigated part of the river was a party sent by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1521 . They named it \`\` River of St. John the Baptist . '' Navigable up to the fall line at Cheraw , the river was an important trade route through the Low Country from colonial times . The largest lumber company in the world existed at the turn of the 20th century near the river 's mouth at Georgetown . The virgin pine forests of the Pee Dee region were cut over , and the logs floated in rafts downriver to be sawn into lumber and exported to the northern United States and Europe . The lower part of the river flood plain was extensively developed for rice culture in colonial time ; rice was the major export of the area from the port at Georgetown . Rice culture declined with the loss of slave labor after the Civil War , and increased overseas competition . Two hurricanes at the beginning of the 20th century destroyed much of the rice canal infrastructure and effectively ended the remnants of rice culture . Today the river is not extensively used for navigation . It is an important source of electric power and public water supplies , as well as recreational use . While the Pee Dee is free - flowing in South Carolina , upstream in North Carolina , several dams have been constructed on it . The opening and closing of these dams causes dramatic swings in the depth of the river in South Carolina .

It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia. - The Uwharrie River (pronounced \\"yoo-WAHR-ee\\") is a river, about 60 mi (100 km) long, in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina in the United States. It is a tributary of the Pee Dee River, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - The Pee Dee region of South Carolina is the northeastern corner of the state. It is the area of the lower watershed of the Pee Dee River, named after the Pee Dee Native American tribe. Its center is Florence. It also encompasses the Grand Strand, which includes the beaches running from the North Carolina state border to the Winyah Bay in Georgetown County in South Carolina. - Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Montreal, on the other hand, produces a large percentage of their electricity through the use of nuclear fission thanks to the large number of nuclear power pants in that state. But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. What is an answer for this question: Which city, Seattle or Montreal, will experience fewer environmental problems?

Information: - Henry Norris Russell (October 25, 1877 February 18, 1957) was an American astronomer who, along with Ejnar Hertzsprung, developed the HertzsprungRussell diagram (1910). In 1923, working with Frederick Saunders, he developed RussellSaunders coupling which is also known as LS coupling. - The radial velocity of an object with respect to a given point is the rate of change of the distance between the object and the point. That is, the radial velocity is the component of the object's velocity that points in the direction of the radius connecting the object and the point. In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from or approaches the Earth. - Variable Star is a 2006 novel written by Spider Robinson based on the surviving seven pages of an eight-page 1955 novel outline by the late Robert A. Heinlein. The book is set in a divergent offshoot of Heinlein's Future History and contains many references to works by Heinlein and other authors. It describes the coming of age of a young musician who signs on to the crew of a starship as a way of escaping from a failed romance. Robinson posted a note on his website in 2009 noting that his agent had sold a trilogy of sequels based on the novel and its characters. - The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction of motion (e.g. to the north). Velocity is an important concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies. - In astronomy, the main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness. These color-magnitude plots are known as HertzsprungRussell diagrams after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or \\"dwarf\\" stars. - Rapidly oscillating Ap stars ( roAp stars ) are a subtype of the Ap star class that exhibit short - timescale rapid photometric or radial velocity variations . The known periods range between 5 and 23 min. They lie in the delta Scuti instability strip on the main sequence . - A Delta Scuti variable (sometimes termed dwarf cepheid) is a variable star which exhibits variations in its luminosity due to both radial and non-radial pulsations of the star's surface. The variables are important standard candles and have been used to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, globular clusters, open clusters, and the Galactic center. The variables follow a period-luminosity relation in certain passbands like other standard candles such as Cepheids. SX Phoenicis variables are generally considered to be a subclass of Delta Scuti variables that contain old stars, and can be found in globular clusters. SX Phe variables also follow a period-luminosity relation. The recently discovered Rapidly oscillating Ap stars are also a subclass of Delta Scuti variables, found on the main sequence. One last sub-class are the pre-main sequence (PMS) Delta Scuti variables. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ejnar Hertzsprung (8 October 1873 21 October 1967) was a Danish chemist and astronomer, born in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the period 19111913, together with Henry Norris Russell, he developed the HertzsprungRussell diagram. - The horizontal branch (HB) is a stage of stellar evolution that immediately follows the red giant branch in stars whose masses are similar to the Sun's. Horizontal-branch stars are powered by helium fusion in the core (via the triple-alpha process) and by hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in a shell surrounding the core. The onset of core helium fusion at the tip of the red giant branch causes substantial changes in stellar structure, resulting in an overall reduction in luminosity, some contraction of the stellar envelope, and the surface reaching higher temperatures. - The HertzsprungRussell diagram, abbreviated HR diagram or HRD, is a scatter graph of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures. More simply, it plots each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness against its temperature (color). It does not map any locations of stars. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A Cepheid variable (or ) is a type of star that pulsates radially, varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. - The unqualified term instability strip usually refers to a region of the HertzsprungRussell diagram largely occupied by several related classes of pulsating variable stars: Delta Scuti variables, SX Phoenicis variables, and rapidly oscillating Ap stars (roAps) near the main sequence; RR Lyrae variables where it intersects the horizontal branch; and the Cepheid variables where it crosses the supergiants.

Translate to English","completion":"\\"Filmmaking was a natural progression during my involvement with painting, as my primary focus was on capturing light, its effect on textured surfaces, its radiant glow in the darkness, the emphasis on juxtaposed colors, the persistence of the gaze and the exhaustion of the eyes,\\" explains Marie Menken. Marie Menken, an influential experimental filmmaker and painter, highlights that her journey from painting to filmmaking was a natural and seamless transition as both mediums share several underlying similarities in regards to capturing light and its relationship with various elements. Her fascination with the effects of light and the way it interacts with different surfaces and colors proves to be the driving force behind her artistic inclinations. In her exploration of light, Menken sheds light on several important aspects that are integral to both painting and filmmaking. She discusses the influence of light on textured surfaces, emphasizing how the interplay between light and texture can create a sense of depth and dimension in a work of art. Additionally, she delves into the radiant glow that light produces in darkness, an effect that has been skillfully employed by many artists to create stunning visuals and evoke certain emotions in their audience. Another significant aspect Menken explores is the juxtaposition of colors and how they are accentuated by light. When colors are placed side by side, they can either complement or contrast with each other, thereby creating a dynamic visual experience. This relationship between colors directly impacts the overall mood and the visual narrative of a work of art, be it a painting or a film. Finally, Menken touches upon the persistence of gaze and the exhaustion of the eyes, which can be interpreted as the artist's desire to continue observing the world around them and capturing it through their art, even when faced with physical or emotional fatigue. This relentless pursuit of artistic expression speaks to the passion and dedication that many artists possess and showcases the powerful drive behind their creative endeavors. In conclusion, Marie Menken's explanation of her transition from painting to filmmaking highlights the inherent similarities between the two mediums and emphasizes the crucial role that light plays in both forms of art. By exploring the various facets of light and its relationship with textured surfaces, juxtaposed colors, and the artist's gaze, Menken provides a profound insight into the world of visual arts and the creative forces that drive them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The decision to change strategy is sometimes claimed as a major mistake by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL). It is argued that persisting with attacks on RAF airfields might have won air superiority for the Luftwaffe. Others argue that the Luftwaffe made little impression on Fighter Command in the last week of August and first week of September and that the shift in strategy was not decisive. It has also been argued that it was doubtful the Luftwaffe could have won air superiority before the \\"weather window\\" began to deteriorate in October. It was also possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could pull out to the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again. Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the Kriegsmarine would have made the projected German invasion, Unternehmen Seelöwe (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or without German air superiority.

Which US Trade Union was led by the notorious Jimmy Hoffa????","completion":"The trade union led by the notorious Jimmy Hoffa was the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The Teamsters Union is one of the largest labor unions in the United States, representing workers in various industries such as transportation, warehousing, and logistics. James Riddle Hoffa, also known as Jimmy Hoffa, was an influential labor leader who played a significant role in the development and growth of the Teamsters Union. He was born on February 14, 1913, in Brazil, Indiana, and grew up in Detroit, Michigan. Hoffa dropped out of school early but displayed a passion for workers' rights and a talent for organizing unions. In the 1930s, he began his career as a labor organizer and quickly rose through the ranks of the Teamsters. Hoffa officially joined the Teamsters in 1933 and quickly gained attention for his ability to rally workers, negotiate strong contracts, and his aggressive use of strikes. Due to his impressive track record, Hoffa became the President of Local 299 in Detroit by 1946. He continued to expand the Teamsters Union by merging it with other trucking-related unions. By 1957, Hoffa had become the International Vice President of the Teamsters, and later that year, he became the International President after the resignation of David Beck, the incumbent at the time. During his tenure as International President, Hoffa transformed the Teamsters Union into one of the most prominent and powerful labor organizations in the United States. Under his leadership, the union continued to negotiate better wages and improved working conditions for its members. Hoffa's ambition to unify the trucking industry led to the establishment of the National Master Freight Agreement in 1964, which standardized wages and benefits across the country, greatly benefiting truck drivers and other workers under the agreement. Although Jimmy Hoffa did have many accomplishments as a union leader, his career was marred by controversy and scandal. Hoffa was known for his connections to organized crime and mob figures. These alliances proved useful for securing contracts and intimidating opponents but made him a target for law enforcement and the media. In 1964, Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and fraud, and in 1967, he received a 13-year prison sentence. However, in December 1971, he was granted an early release from prison by President Richard Nixon, under the condition that he would not engage in union activities for a specified period. Despite the restriction imposed on his union activities, Hoffa continued his efforts to regain control of the Teamsters Union, leading to a feud with his successor, Frank Fitzsimmons. On July 30, 1975, Jimmy Hoffa disappeared from the parking lot of the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. His disappearance remains one of the most enduring American mysteries, and despite various theories and speculations, his fate remains unknown. In summary, the notorious Jimmy Hoffa led the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and played a crucial role in transforming it into a powerful and influential labor organization. However, his career was characterized by controversies, criminal connections, and a mysterious disappearance that continues to capture the public's imagination to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

France used alternative sources of energy. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country released less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere? Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided, France released less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. This is because France used alternative sources of energy, while Spain relied on fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere than alternative energy sources. This excess carbon dioxide contributes to global warming or climate change due to its heat-trapping properties, much like the panes of a greenhouse. Therefore, since France used alternative energy sources rather than fossil fuels, they released less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere compared to Spain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last of the person who worked closely with a singer to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound?, using the article: American singer Prudencesa Renfro, professionally known as Pru, was signed through Warner/Chappell Music Publishing by Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was \\"drawn to\\" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes. The record was completed at Studio 57 and Weight Room in New York City, with mixing handled by Mike Shipley and Tony Maserati.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose imperial title was recognized? ? Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king.

One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said.

Answer based on context: In late February 1586, Friedrich Cloedt, whom Gebhard had placed in command of Neuss, and Martin Schenck went to Westphalia at the head of 500 foot and 500 horse. After plundering Vest Recklinghausen, on 1 March they captured Werl through trickery. They loaded a train of wagons with soldiers and covered them with salt. When the wagons of salt were seen outside the city gates, they were immediately admitted, salt being a valued commodity. The \\"salted soldiers\\" then over-powered the guard and captured the town. Some of the defenders escaped to the citadel, and could not be dislodged. Claude de Berlaymont, also known as Haultpenne after the name of his castle, collected his own force of 4000 and besieged Schenck and Cloedt in Werl. Attacked from the outside by Haultpenne, and from the inside by the soldiers in the citadel, Schenck and Cloedt broke out of the city with their soldiers on 3 March. Unable to break through the lines, they retreated into the city once more, but several of their soldiers did not make it into the city, and plundered the neighboring villages; 250 local residents were killed. On 8 March, Schenck and Cloedt loaded their wagons, this time with booty, took 30 magistrates as hostages, and attacked Haultpenne's force, killing about 500 of them, and losing 200 of their own. Included in the hostages were the Bürgermeister Johann von Pappen and several other high-ranking officials; although von Pappen died during the retreat, the remaining hostages were released after the payment of a high ransom. Schenck retreated to Venlo and Cloedt returned to the city of Neuss. What did Cloedt use to capture Werl?","completion":"Friedrich Cloedt utilized a tactic of subterfuge to capture the city of Werl in late February 1586. He and Martin Schenck led 500 foot soldiers and 500 horse soldiers to Westphalia, and on 1 March, they deployed a crafty strategy to enter and seize control of Werl. The plan involved using a train of wagons which they loaded with their soldiers and then covered them with salt. Salt, during that time, was a highly prized and valued commodity. So, when this train of wagons filled with salt was seen outside the city gates of Werl, the unsuspecting city guards immediately admitted them into the city. Once inside, the soldiers who were hidden and disguised under the salt covers, also known as the \\"salted soldiers\\", overpowered the city guard, thereby capturing the town. However, some of the city's defenders managed to escape to the citadel and couldn't be forced out. Nonetheless, the majority of the town was successfully captured by Cloedt and his forces through this ingenious strategy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To cut batting into four inch squares, you can","completion":"follow these steps: Step 1: Gather Materials Before you start, gather the necessary materials, including: - Batting (the desired length and width) - Ruler or measuring tape - Fabric chalk or washable fabric marker - Cutting mat - Rotary cutter or sharp fabric scissors Step 2: Prepare the Work Area Find a suitable flat surface for cutting, such as a table or a countertop. Place the cutting mat on the surface to protect the area from potential damage. Step 3: Measure and Mark Lay out the batting on the cutting mat with the edges aligned. Using the ruler or measuring tape, measure across the batting every four inches horizontally and vertically. Use fabric chalk or a washable fabric marker to mark these measurements, creating a grid of four-inch squares. Justification: It's essential to measure and mark the batting accurately to create evenly-sized squares and minimize waste. Step 4: Cut along the marked lines Hold the rotary cutter or fabric scissors at a proper angle for precise cutting. Start cutting by following the marked lines you've created along the horizontal and vertical axes, being careful to stay on the lines. If using a rotary cutter, using a ruler to guide your cuts will help ensure straight lines. If using fabric scissors, take care to maintain the same cutting angle for each cut. Justification: Cutting the marked lines ensures even, four-inch squares that will be suitable for your project. Step 5: Stack and Organize Once all the squares are cut, stack them neatly and organize them according to color, pattern, or fabric type, if applicable. This will help you keep track of your supplies and make it easier to find the squares you need while working on your project. Justification: Organizing the cut squares helps to maintain a neat workstation and makes the project assembly more efficient. Step 6: Clean Up After cutting and organizing the squares, put away all the materials and tools you used. Dispose of any extra fabric or batting scraps, if they're not needed for another project. Wipe down the work surface with a wet cloth if necessary, to remove any chalk or fabric dust. Justification: Cleaning up your work area helps maintain a tidy and safe working space and ensures that your tools and materials are ready for use the next time you need them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains. Now, I have a new situation: Frank owned two parcels of land. He called them Forest and Field. The Forest parcel was covered in old-growth pine, while Field one was covered in grass and wildflowers. Frank was very proud of his properties. Answer this question please: Which parcel had fewer plants with large and feathery stigma? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the parcel likely to have fewer plants with large and feathery stigma is the 'Forest' parcel, which is covered with old-growth pine trees. To understand why, we should first comprehend the biological mechanisms of plant reproduction. There are two main types of pollination, namely, anemophily and entomophily. Anemophily is wind-pollination, where the pollen grains are light and small, made to be carried by the wind from one plant to another. On the other hand, entomophily is insect-pollination, where larger, sticky pollen grains are carried from plant to plant by insects. Plants that utilize anemophily - such as pine trees mentioned for the 'Forest' parcel - generally have smaller, less conspicuous flowers without a strong odor or nectar. Their stamens, the male reproductive organ which produces pollen, are well-exposed to wind, and they tend to lack the large and feathery stigma that characterizes entomophilous species. The large and feathery stigma, a part of the female reproductive organ in plants, serves to trap airborne pollen more effectively - a feature not essential for anemophilous plants. In contrast, plants that rely on entomophily, which could include various species of grass and wildflowers that cover Frank's 'Field' parcel, generally have more significant, more brightly colored, and fragrant flowers. These are adaptations designed to attract insects, and they often come along with a large and feathery stigma for more effectively capturing the pollen that insects transport. Given these characteristics, the 'Forest' parcel of Frank's property, dominated by anemophilous pine trees, likely has a significantly lower number of plants with large and feathery stigma compared to the 'Field' parcel, which appears to contain several entomophilous grasses and wildflowers. Such plants typically have more substantial, feathery stigmas to facilitate insect-borne pollen capture. Still, it's important to remember that this is a generalization, and individual plant species can vary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Which student read less about the activation energy barrier? Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Background: RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV and, beginning with the ninth season, VH1. The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. Context: Beginning with the seventh season, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews and Carson Kressley are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the start of season 3, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the start of season 7, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and Santino Rice, who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season 8, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, and all stars 1, and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging has been provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), Mike Ruiz, Jeffrey Moran (Absolut Vodka marketing executive), or Lucian Piane. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons. Prior to the grande finale, the three main judges are joined by two celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included Paula Abdul, Pamela Anderson, Eve, Ariana Grande, Neil Patrick Harris, Kathy Griffin, Debbie Harry, Khloe Kardashian, La Toya Jackson, Adam Lambert, Demi Lovato, Bob Mackie, Rose McGowan, Olivia Newton-John, Rebecca Romijn, Gigi Hadid, Sharon Osbourne, Dan Savage, John Waters, Michelle Williams, Candis Cayne, Martha Wash, Natalie Cole, Dita Von Teese, Niecy Nash, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Wilmer Valderrama, The Pointer Sisters, Trina, Leah Remini, The B-52's, Kesha and Lady Gaga. The judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the episode's winner and which two had the weakest performances. The day before judging, the contestants are all provided with a song to which they must learn the lyrics. The contestants deemed as being the bottom two must \\"lip sync for their lives\\" to the song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul alone decides who stays and who leaves. RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \\"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\\" The phrase \\"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is CUNT.

Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ice cube will melt faster? Answer:","completion":"Ice cube B will melt faster. In the given experiment, Kendra has placed two ice cubes on separate pans, each placed on a burner. The burners are set to different temperatures: one with a low temperature and the other with a significantly higher temperature. Based on this information, ice cube A is placed on the burner with a low temperature, while ice cube B is placed on the burner with the higher temperature. The rate of melting of an ice cube depends on the heat being supplied to it. The greater the heat supplied, the faster the ice cube will melt. In this scenario, ice cube B is subject to more heat than ice cube A due to the difference in the temperature settings of the burners. One minute after she started the experiment, Kendra began to record her observations. At this point, ice cube B, which is exposed to the higher temperature, would have absorbed more thermal energy. This would lead to a faster increase in temperature and melting of the ice compared to ice cube A, which is being heated at a lower temperature. In conclusion, based on the details provided and the known effects of temperature on the melting of ice, ice cube B will melt at a faster rate than ice cube A, as it is receiving more heat from the burner it is placed on."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: License to Wonder In the wake of my column last week about how the faces you make when speaking different languages might affect your mood, several people wrote and accused me of speculating. I admit it! Indeed, I said as much in the piece. One of my favorite things to do is to take a set of facts and use them to imagine how the world might work. In writing about some of these ideas, my aim is not to be correct — how can I be, when the answer isn’t known? — but to be thought-provoking, to ask questions, to make people wonder. I mention this because science is usually presented as a body of knowledge — facts to be memorized, equations to be solved, concepts to be understood, discoveries to be applauded. But this approach can give students two misleading impressions. One is that science is about what we know. One colleague told me that when he was studying science at school, the relentless focus on the known gave him the impression that almost everything had already been discovered. But in fact, science — as the physicist Richard Feynman once wrote — creates an “expanding frontier of ignorance,” where most discoveries lead to more questions. (This frontier — this peering into the unknown — is what I especially like to write about.) Moreover, insofar as science is a body of knowledge, that body is provisional: much of what we thought we knew in the past has turned out to be incomplete, or plain wrong. The second misconception that comes from this “facts, facts, facts” method of teaching science is the impression that scientific discovery progresses as an orderly, logical “creep”; that each new discovery points more or less unambiguously to the next. But in reality, while some scientific work does involve the plodding, brick-by-brick accumulation of evidence, much of it requires leaps of imagination and daring speculation. (This raises the interesting question of when speculation is more likely to generate productive lines of enquiry than deductive creep. I don’t know the answer — I’d have to speculate.) There are plenty of (probably) apocryphal tales about what inspired a great discovery, from Archimedes in his bathtub, to Newton and his apple. But there are also many well-documented accounts of inspiration — or lack of it — in the history of science. Among the most famous is the story of Rosalind Franklin and her non-discovery of the structure of DNA. Franklin was an expert at getting x-ray diagrams from crystals of molecules. The idea is that the array of spots in the diagram will reveal how the atoms in the crystal are arranged. When Franklin started working on DNA, she obtained superb x-ray diagrams; one of her contemporaries described them as among the most beautiful of any substance ever taken. Indeed, it was from one of her diagrams that James Watson and Francis Crick deduced what the correct structure of DNA must be. (The picture was shown to Watson without Franklin’s knowledge.) She had the data. Why didn’t she reach the solution? There are several answers to this; but one is that she had a fixed idea about how the problem should be solved. Namely, she wanted to work out the structure using the methods she had been taught. These methods are intricate, abstract, and mathematical, and difficult to use on a molecule as complex as DNA. Watson and Crick, meanwhile, were building physical models of what the diagram suggested the structure should be like — an approach that Franklin scorned. What’s more, their first model was ludicrously wrong, something that Franklin spotted immediately. But they were willing to play; she wasn’t. In other words, she wouldn’t, or couldn’t, adopt a more intuitive, speculative approach. Our ability to make scientific discoveries is limited in a number of fundamental ways. One is time: it’s hard to do good experiments that last for more than a few weeks. Experiments that run for years are rare; as a result, we know relatively little about long, slow processes. Another constraint is money (no surprise there); a third is ethics (some experiments that would be interesting to do are ethically impossible). Some questions remain uninvestigated because no one stands to profit from the answers. Still others are neglected because they have no obvious bearing on human health or welfare, the areas of research are unfashionable, or the appropriate tools haven’t been invented yet. Some problems are just overwhelmingly complex. But there’s one way in which we should not be limited: imagination. As Einstein put it, “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.” Why Rosalind Franklin didn’t solve the structure of DNA when she had the data has been much discussed; see, in particular, Maddox, B. 2002. “Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA” Harper Collins. See also, Judson, H. F. 1996. “The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology” Expanded Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Press; and Watson, J. D. 2001. “The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA.” Touchstone Press. Many thanks to Daniel Brockert, Dan Haydon, Horace Judson and, especially, Gideon Lichfield, for insights, comments and suggestions. Summary:","completion":"In the article, the author talks about how science is often thought of as a collection of facts and knowledge, but it's also about asking questions, making discoveries, and using imagination. Sometimes, scientists need to think outside the box and take risks, like playing with ideas or creating physical models to solve problems. The author mentions the story of Rosalind Franklin, who had important data about DNA but didn't figure out its structure because she stuck to traditional methods. In the end, imagination is what helps us make scientific breakthroughs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Interchangeable parts are plentiful for custom-made automobiles.; D. Interchangeable parts can fit many kinds of automobiles.;The answer is:","completion":"D. Interchangeable parts can fit many kinds of automobiles. Interchangeable parts have several advantages over non-interchangeable or custom-made parts for automobiles. The primary advantage, as stated in option D, is that interchangeable parts can fit many different types of automobiles, making it easier and more cost-effective for manufacturers, mechanics, and car owners alike. Here are some specific advantages of using interchangeable parts in the automobile industry: 1. Economies of Scale: By using standardized, interchangeable parts, car manufacturers can produce a high volume of components for various car models at lower costs per unit. This is due to the possibility of mass production, which can result in lower prices for both automakers and consumers. 2. Greater Availability: Interchangeable parts are generally more accessible than custom-made parts for automobiles, as they are mass-produced and therefore more likely to be available at automotive retailers and repair shops. This increased availability makes it easier and quicker for automobile owners to find the necessary parts for their vehicles, thus reducing downtime in cases of maintenance or repairs. 3. Easier Repairs and Maintenance: Mechanics can work more efficiently and confidently on vehicles using interchangeable parts, as they are likely already familiar with the common components used in various car models. Additionally, standardized parts can allow for quicker repair times, as available inventory is more predictable, and mechanics can quickly and easily identify the correct replacement part for various car models. 4. Increased Competition Among Suppliers: The use of interchangeable parts can lead to increased competition among automotive suppliers, as numerous companies can manufacture and supply the same part. This competition can drive down prices for the components and ultimately benefit the consumer. 5. Improved Quality Control: Interchangeable parts usually undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure that they meet the criteria for mass production. This strict review process helps ensure that parts are consistent in quality and will function reliably in various automobiles. In summary, the primary advantage of using interchangeable parts over custom-made parts in the automotive industry is versatility, as they can fit many different types of vehicles. This leads to lower costs, greater availability, easier repairs and maintenance, increased competition among suppliers, and improved quality control for the industry as a whole."},{"prompt":"Article: Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries.

Definition: In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article.

Input: Abstract: The biological antagonism between Notch and Numb controls the proliferative/differentiative balance in development and homeostasis. Although altered Notch signaling has been linked to human diseases, including cancer, evidence for a substantial involvement of Notch in human tumors has remained elusive. Here, we show that Numb-mediated control on Notch signaling is lost in ∼50% of human mammary carcinomas, due to specific Numb ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, Numb operates as an oncosuppressor, as its ectopic expression in Numb-negative, but not in Numb-positive, tumor cells inhibits proliferation. Increased Notch signaling is observed in Numb-negative tumors, but reverts to basal levels after enforced expression of Numb. Conversely, Numb silencing increases Notch signaling in normal breast cells and in Numb-positive breast tumors. Finally, growth suppression of Numb-negative, but not Numb-positive, breast tumors can be achieved by pharmacological inhibition of Notch. Thus, the Numb/Notch biological antagonism is relevant to the homeostasis of the normal mammary parenchyma and its subversion contributes to human mammary carcinogenesis.. Title: Loss of negative regulation by Numb over Notch is relevant to human breast carcinogenesis Output:","completion":"Yes Justification: The title \\"Loss of negative regulation by Numb over Notch is relevant to human breast carcinogenesis\\" is directly in line with the information presented in the abstract. The body of the abstract maintains the discussion about the influence of Notch and Numb in cell development, particularly touching on their antagonistic relationship. It provides evidence of the Numb protein acting as a form of control over Notch signaling, which is lost in approximately 50% of human mammary carcinomas. The decrease in Numb leading to an increase in Notch signaling is specifically linked to human mammary carcinogenesis in the abstract, which is directly correspondent to the title."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"Where did money to fund the 9/11 plotters come from and where didn't it come from?\\" Response: \\"From Al Queda.

Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional waste.Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn.Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way waste hours of their time changing the dresses they have.Skirts are lengthened; necklines are lowered or raised, and so on.

In this case, we can subtract 1468 from both sides to achieve this. 1492 - 1468 = -3 * p + 1468 - 1468 24 = -3 * p Step 2: Now, to find the value of p, we need to isolate it further.

Write a text based on this summary: bush urges china to strengthen currency and chinese minister meets with angry us lawmakers Text:","completion":"Former President Bush Urges China to Strengthen Currency as Chinese Minister Meets with Angry US Lawmakers In a recent turn of events, former President George W. Bush called upon China to strengthen its national currency as concerns over economic imbalances continue to grow. This comes on the heels of a tense meeting between a Chinese minister and US lawmakers who are increasingly upset over alleged Chinese trade practices. Bush's statement underlines the mounting pressure on China to address its currency valuation. The former president highlighted the importance of a stronger Chinese currency in promoting global economic stability and reducing trade imbalances. He also emphasized that such a move would benefit both the Chinese and US economies. Meanwhile, a Chinese minister met with a group of displeased US lawmakers to discuss various concerns regarding China's economic policies. While the specifics of the meeting remain undisclosed, it is evident that tensions between the two countries have escalated. A significant point of contention among US legislators is the belief that China is deliberately undervaluing its currency to gain a competitive advantage in the global market. Experts have long argued that China's weak currency gives it an unfair edge in international trade. In turn, this alleged manipulation undermines the value of American-made goods and contributes to the longstanding US trade deficit. The recent meeting between the Chinese minister and US lawmakers only serves to exacerbate these concerns as calls for reform grow louder. While it remains unclear what steps will be taken to address these currency-related disputes, the situation has undeniably shed light on the increasing friction between the two economic powerhouses. As more voices join the chorus urging China to strengthen its currency, one can only hope that a resolution will be reached to maintain global economic stability and foster cooperation between the nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The initial statement, \\"Slate readers want more Monica,\\" signifies that the readers enjoy reading stories about Monica or find them interesting and engaging. This could be because they find her life intriguing, enjoy her writing style, appreciate her perspective on different subjects, or various other reasons. They are looking forward to more content covering Monica and desire further insight into her experiences, opinions, or ideas. On the other hand, the conclusion that \\"Slate readers have indicated that they do not want to read any more stories about Monica\\" suggests that the readers do not find stories about Monica appealing, engaging, or relevant to their interests. In this context, the readers would prefer not to see any further content about Monica, as they may believe it is uninteresting, poorly-written, or not insightful. Since these two statements hold entirely opposite implications, it would be a mistake to draw such a conclusion based on the given information.

Las Vegas Fire and Rescue and North Las Vegas Fire Department received word of a man stuck in a tree about 4:30 p.m. in the 1700 block of James Street, near Owens Avenue and Pecos Road, said NLV fire spokesman Cedric Williams in a statement. Upon arriving, firefighters located a 25- to 30-foot palm tree in the yard of a single-story home, but hanging palm fronds shrouded the apparent victim, Williams said. Risks of trimming palm trees Crews used a ladder to access the fronds covering the victim and cut them down to attempt a rescue. Upon reaching the man, firefighters determined he was dead, Williams said. The Clark County Coroner's Office will release the cause of death and identify the victim after family notification. Deaths from suffocation can occur when palm fronds collapse over trimmers' heads, pinning them to the trees. The California Department of Public Health created a YouTube video highlighting the danger faced by trimmers. ||||| Published on Apr 21, 2014 Tree trimming and pruning is a dangerous occupation.

He says that \\"sinkholes are formed by precipitation\\" and \\"rain is also known as precipitation\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"Rain, also known as precipitation, can cause several outcomes and events, including the formation of sinkholes. Based on the hints provided by the teacher, it can be inferred that rain contributes to the process of creating sinkholes. Sinkholes are cavities in the ground that form when water, particularly rainwater, seeps into the soil and dissolves the underlying soluble bedrock, such as limestone, gypsum, or salt deposits. Over time, this dissolution creates voids and channels beneath the surface. As rainwater continues to infiltrate the ground, the layers of soil, sediment, and rock above the voids become unstable and may eventually collapse, creating a sinkhole. Rain can cause other consequences as well, some of which include: 1. Flooding: Heavy and prolonged rainfall can lead to overflowing of rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, eventually causing floods. Floods can damage property, infrastructure, and even result in loss of life. 2. Erosion: The continuous process of rainwater hitting the ground can lead to significant soil erosion, leading to loss of fertile topsoil, landslides, and an increased risk of desertification in some arid regions. 3. Landslides and mudslides: Saturated soil, combined with gravity and the instability of slopes, can result in landslides or mudslides. These events can lead to the destruction of property, infrastructure, and, in severe cases, loss of human or animal life. 4. Water pollution: Rainwater can carry pollutants and contaminants on the ground surface into bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. This contributes to water pollution and can have harmful effects on aquatic life and ecosystems. 5. Replenishing water resources: On a positive note, rainwater refills underground aquifers, lakes, and reservoirs, thereby providing fresh water to ecosystems and for human consumption. In conclusion, the best answer to the quiz question \\"What can rain cause?\\" would be that rain, as a form of precipitation, can cause various outcomes, including the formation of sinkholes, flooding, erosion, landslides, mudslides, water pollution, and replenishing water resources."},{"prompt":"What type of details about duane andrews can be gathered from the following bio?

New Haven, Connecticut: For over a century, New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War.

On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional military bearing, including uniforms. Please answer a question about this article.

The review expresses satisfaction with various important aspects of the service provided by this local garage. The reviewer goes on to discuss the difficulty of finding a trustworthy mechanic in the Las Vegas area, which can be seen as implicit praise for this particular business because the reviewer has found exactly what they are looking for here. The statement \\"Great service and great value\\" signifies that the reviewer is appreciating the quality of service offered, simultaneously suggesting that the costs are fair or competitive. This indicates that the reviewer believes they received excellent service worth what they paid for it. The phrase \\"If you are looking for a great honest garage this is the one\\" implies that the reviewer has found the garage to be reliable and upfront, which are desirable attributes in any business, but particularly in the automotive repair industry, where trust and honesty can be critical concerns for customers. The reviewer's prediction - \\"This place is one that is going to have repeat customers over and over again\\" - indicates further positivity. It suggests that the service is good enough to warrant multiple visits and implies customer loyalty, both of which are indicators of customer satisfaction. Lastly, the recommendation - \\"I would recommend to everyone\\" - serves as a direct endorsement of the local garage in question. The fact that the reviewer is comfortable recommending the service to everybody shows their high level of trust and confidence in this garage's abilities.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where could you find out more about a type of lizard? Possible A: in the garden floor, rocks, books, bushes, garden Why is \\"books\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Books\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, most notably because books are a well-established source of knowledge and information on virtually any subject matter, including different types of lizards. Books, such as those in print or digital form, have been used by humans for centuries to document, store, and share knowledge on countless topics and can be written by experts in the field of herpetology, which is the study of reptiles and amphibians. In a book on reptiles, you may discover various facts about a specific type of lizard, such as its habitat, physical features, biological characteristics, and behavioral patterns. Books that are specifically about lizards, or reptiles more broadly, will offer greater depth and breadth of information on such topics, allowing readers to learn detailed information about various lizard species, their adaptations, and their overall role in the ecosystem. Additionally, books will likely include photographs, illustrations, or diagrams to help readers visualize said lizards and their unique characteristics. Comparatively, the other possible answers, such as the garden floor, rocks, bushes, and garden, all pertain to the natural environment where one might encounter a lizard in person. While these settings could indeed be useful for observing a lizard in its natural habitat and gaining firsthand observational experience, they likely would not provide the same depth and scope of knowledge that would be available in a book. Moreover, it would be more difficult to accurately identify and distinguish between lizard species without prior knowledge gained from external sources such as books or expert guidance. Furthermore, books on lizards can be found in libraries, bookstores, online retailers, or through scholarly resources that could help expand one's understanding and knowledge about specific lizard species. These resources would have typically undergone careful editing and review by experts, making the information more reliable than that gathered solely through personal observations. With all these factors combined, \\"books\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense when seeking more information about a type of lizard, as it provides easy access to reliable, curated knowledge that has been gathered and reviewed over time. While firsthand observations in nature can be valuable, having a foundation of knowledge acquired from books is essential for proper identification and understanding of a given lizard species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: According to the 2006 Canadian Census (0038.00 census tract), approximately 76% of the residents at Kensington Market are Canadian citizens. Of that 7%, 9% are under the age of 18. This means that 24% of Kensington Markets population is non-Canadian citizens, a figure that speaks to Kensington Markets character as a hub for multiculturalism. Furthermore, in 2011 the National Household Survey reported very similar data. Although the population accounted by citizenship status increased from 2006 and 2011, the percentage of those with Canadian citizenship versus those without the citizenship remained the same. In 2006, 2800 residents reported that they were Canadian citizens whereas 870 residents reported they did not hold Canadian citizenship . In 2011, 2950 residents reported they were Canadian citizens whereas 930 residents reported that they did not hold Canadian citizenship. Comparing this to the Canadian ratio between Canadian and non-Canadian citizenship data from the census for 2006 and 2011 the ratio changed by 0.4% resulting in an increase in non-Canadian citizens within the population that received the long form survey and the National Household survey (Census 2006; Census 2011 NHS). Although this percent increase is small, when speaking on the national scale, this 0.4% increase in ratio involved 32,852,320 respondents for 2011 and 31,241,030 respondents for 2006 (Census 2006; Census 2011). Comparing that with the minimal increase which was 0.3% in ratio for Kensington where the population was not as substantial, this increase is not as substantial as well (Census 2006; Census 2011 NHS). Question: How many more residents were Canadian citizens than non-citizens in 2011? Answer:","completion":"In 2011, there were 2,950 residents in Kensington Market who reported they were Canadian citizens, while 930 residents reported that they did not hold Canadian citizenship. To determine the difference between the number of Canadian citizens and non-citizens, we subtract the number of non-citizens from the number of citizens. 2,950 (Canadian citizens) - 930 (non-citizens) = 2,020 Thus, there were 2,020 more residents with Canadian citizenship than non-citizens in Kensington Market in 2011."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 1940's it was a wholesome, specific little community. It was my home and I loved it there; back then I thought I would never leave. My best friend Rose and I used to collectively dream about raising a family of our own someday. We had it all planned out to live next door to one another. Our dream remained alive through grade school, high school, and even beyond. Rose was my maid of honor when I got married in 1953 to the love of my life, Dick. Even then she joked that she was just one perfect guy short of being married, thus bringing us closer to our dream. Meanwhile, Dick aspired to be an officer in the Marines and I fully supported his ambitions. I realized that he might be stationed far away from Jamaica Plain, but I told him I would relocate and adjust. The idea of experiencing new places together seemed somewhat romantic to me. So, in 1955, Dick was stationed in Alaska and we relocated. Rose was sad to see me leave, but wished me the best of luck. Rose and I remained in touch for a few years by regular phone call but after a while we lost track of one another. Back in the 1950's it was a lot more difficult to stay in touch with someone over a long distance, especially if you were relocating every few years. There were no email addresses or transferable phone number and directory lookup services were available at best. I thought of her several times over the years. Once in the mid 1960's ,when I was visiting the Greater Boston area, I tried to determine her whereabouts but my search turned up empty-handed. Jamaica Plain had changed drastically in the 10 years I was gone. A pretty obvious shift in income demographics was affecting my old neighborhood. My family had moved out of the area, as did many of the people I used to know. Rose was nowhere to be found. 52 years passed and we never spoke. I've since raised a family of five, all of whom now have families of their own, and Dick passed away a few... The writer failed to find Rose in the mid of 1960's, because _ ? A) Rose left her homeland. B) Rose wouldn't like to see her C) the surroundings there had changed a lot. D) they lost in touch for a long time Answer:","completion":"The writer failed to find Rose in the midst of the 1960s because of several contributing factors, but primarily due to the significant changes in the neighborhood and the long period of lost touch. This relates most directly to options C) the surroundings there had changed a lot and D) they lost in touch for a long time. C) The surroundings had changed substantially: Over ten years of absence, the writer observed a drastic shift in Jamaica Plain. This transformation was noticeable not only in the appearance of the community itself, but also in the demographics of its population. The writer detected an obvious shift in income demographics that was impacting her old neighbourhood. This infers that many of the former residents may have moved away due to increasing costs, or that the composition of the community altered as a different population moved in. The houses, landmarks, and familiar points of reference might have changed or vanished, making the process of locating someone extremely challenging. The writer implies that even her family had relocated from the area, which, combined with the fact that many other familiar faces had likewise moved away, added another layer of difficulty to locating Rose. D) They had lost touch for a long time: The loss of contact for many years is another significant factor behind the writer's failure to locate Rose. Back in the 1950s, keeping in touch especially over long distances was quite challenging. Without the modern conveniences of the internet, email, cell phones, and social media, remaining connected required a significant effort, involving regular letters or expensive long-distance phone calls. As the writer and Rose moved in different life directions and were physically distant, their communication eventually dwindled. The fact that the two friends lost touch meant the writer had no current information to help track down Rose - for example, a new address, a married name, or details about Rose's own life circumstances and changes. Without this information and coupled with significant changes in the physical environment of Jamaica Plain, it became a sizable challenge to trace Rose, leading to the unsuccessful endeavor when the writer revisited their hometown. In conclusion, although both factors played a role in why the writer couldn't find Rose, option C most directly speaks to why the specific attempt in the mid 1960s was unsuccessful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden.

There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from 200 to 130, I would have spent 2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain.

Your task is to judge the naturaleness of the system generated reference. If the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker output 1, else output 0. System Reference: x is a chinese restaurant near the river and i serve food. Original Reference: x is a chinese restaurant in the riverside area. A:","completion":"To determine if the system-generated reference could have been produced by a native speaker, I will compare it to the original reference and evaluate the grammar, sentence structure, and meaning. System Reference: x is a chinese restaurant near the river and i serve food. Original Reference: x is a chinese restaurant in the riverside area. Step 1: Evaluate grammar The grammar in the system reference seems natural, but there is a minor shift from third person (\\"x is\\") to first person (\\"i serve\\") which could be a mistake. Step 2: Evaluate sentence structure The sentence structure seems natural, although the switch from third to first person might be a bit confusing. Step 3: Evaluate meaning The meaning is mostly retained from the original reference, describing a Chinese restaurant near the river. However, the addition of \\"and I serve food\\" doesn't add much value since it's obvious that a restaurant serves food, and it changes the point of view to the speaker. Conclusion: The system-generated reference has a minor issue with the shift from third to first person, making it sound unnatural.

His spokesman recently denied this, telling the New York Times that Pence neither \\"supported or advocated\\" the practice.

A new plan for getting children to and from school is being started by the education authorities in part of Eastern England. This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads. Until now the Country Council has only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed. Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, provided the arrangement will not lose money and that children taking part will be attending their nearest school. The new scheme is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington school. The children live just within the three-mile limit and the Council has said in the past it will not undertake to provide free transport to the school. But now they have agreed to organize a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster. Between 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part. Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a council official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS6. 50 a term. They have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington. The same bus would now just make an extra journey to pick up the Milton children.

The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study medicine (file picture) Children should learn about the medical world from the age of seven to encourage them to become doctors, according to experts. They say primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops. The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council which represents medical schools all over the country, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study the subject. Only two fifths of doctors attended non-selective state schools, while a third were privately educated. Medicine is a very popular career choice, the guidance says, with fierce competition. 'Medical schools have worked hard so that they can attract the right candidates and to establish admissions processes which are fair to all,' it says. 'Yet it remains that more needs to be done to ensure that the medical profession is representative of the society it serves, and that medical students are able to learn in a diverse environment.' This is the first time that the council has published advice on how to widen access to medical courses. It suggests that the 'journey to medicine' should start in primary schools, an area which is sometimes overlooked by medical schools. Pupils should be told about the qualifications and routes to becoming a doctor, the guidance says, and take part in 'lively and fun' activities linked to the profession. This could include roadshows, campus visits, demonstrations and workshops. 'Medical students acting as ambassadors are often the best people to lead activity, which can include demonstrations, campus tours and mentoring,' it says. 'Some medical schools formally recognise this work by medical students as part of their educational development.' In secondary schools, students should be taught about studying medicine at university and what a career in the profession involves. This includes helping pupils make the right subject choices for their GCSEs, Scottish Nationals, A-levels and other qualifications. The guidance goes on to suggest that when pupils are in the sixth-form, medical schools could offer would-be students help in making applications, including support in writing personal statements and preparing for interviews and admissions tests. Experts said primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops to help encourage them to train up. They could also run master classes and summer schools for secondary school pupils of all ages. Professor Tony Weetman, chair of the Selecting for Excellence Executive Group, said: 'A candidate's journey to a medical degree starts long before the Ucas application is made. 'The commitment in terms of hard work and academic achievement is of course essential, but before that must come the awareness that studying medicine is an option. 'That realisation does not come readily to all potential candidates, be they school students or mature learners, and we know that one's background will play a central part here. 'Medical schools cannot leave potentially excellent candidates to learn this message on their own; they have a responsibility, where possible, to reach out to these people and show them first-hand that a career in medicine is for anyone with the ability and commitment.' Professor Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: 'This guidance represents a major development in helping to improve access to the elite medical profession. 'Going to medical school opens the door to a career in a rewarding, high-status profession and that door should be open to everyone who has what it takes to be an excellent doctor, regardless of their background.'

The meaning of the name is \\"white phantom\\" (etymologically cognate with \\"Gwenhwyfar\\", the original Welsh form of Guinevere). The Dindsenchas also mention a Findabair that is the daughter of Lugaid Laigde. Sentence: Findabair died before she was able to take the throne from her Queen mother.","completion":"The text provided does not contain any information about Findabair's death or her potential ascension to the throne as a successor to her Queen mother. The information in the text is limited to the etymology of her name and the fact that she is the daughter of Ailill and Queen Medb, along with an additional mention from the Dindsenchas that another Findabair is the daughter of Lugaid Laigde. It's important to note that within the context of Irish mythology, Findabair is indeed a notable character, and her fate can largely depend on the specific myth or story from which the details are drawn. However, to assess the validity of the sentence, \\"Findabair died before she was able to take the throne from her Queen mother,\\" the provided text does not provide any details or events related to this scenario.

It explicitly states that the series shares continuity with the films and other television series of the MCU, meaning that the show exists in the same universe and timeline and its plot and characters are influenced by the events of the films and other series in the MCU franchise. The television series, created by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Maurissa Tancharoen for ABC, is based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D.

Step 2: Evaluate each option. Option A: More predators have been moving into the area. - If more predators move into the area, it would have a negative effect on the rabbit population as there will be more animals hunting and consuming them. Therefore, this option is unlikely to cause an increase in the rabbit population. Option B: The rabbits are becoming infertile. - If rabbits are becoming infertile, it would mean fewer offspring being produced, which would lead to a decrease in the population. Thus, this option also does not explain the increase in the rabbit population. Option C: Hunters are trapping the rabbits. - Similar to Option A, if hunters are trapping the rabbits, it would result in a decrease in the rabbit population. This option is not the correct explanation for an increasing rabbit population. Option D: More precipitation falling lately. - An increase in precipitation can lead to increased plant growth, which could provide more food resources for the rabbits. This would benefit the survival and reproduction of the rabbits, potentially leading to a population increase. Step 3: Choose the most plausible option to explain the increasing rabbit population.

Article: A lot of us lose life's tough battles by starting a frontal attack--when a touch of humor might well enable us to win. Consider the case of a young friend of mine, who hit a traffic jam on his way to work shortly after receiving an ultimatum about being late on the job. Although there was a good reason for Sam's a being late--serious illness at home--he decided that this by-now-familiar excuse wouldn't work any longer. His supervisor was probably already pacing up and down preparing a dismissal speech. Yes, the boss was, Sam entered the office at 9:35. The place was as quiet as a locker room ; everyone was hard at work. Sam's supervisor came up to him. Suddenly, Sam forced a grin and stretched out his hand. \\"How do you do!\\" he said. \\"I'm Sam Maynard. I'm applying for a job. Which, I understand, became available just 35 minutes ago. Does the early bird get the worm?\\" The room exploded in laughter. The supervisor _ a smile and walked back to his office. Sam Maynard had saved his job--with the only tool that could win, a laugh.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Suppose abstaining from sexual intercourse happens, and we try to analyze its impact on the number of ice trays filled to the appropriate level. To properly assess this situation, we must first understand the relationship between the two factors, if any. Abstaining from sexual intercourse is an individual or mutual decision made by people for various reasons, including personal beliefs, health conditions, or waiting for the right partner. It usually does not have any direct correlation with household chores or responsibilities like filling ice trays. On the other hand, filling ice trays to the appropriate level is a simple task that can be carried out by anyone in a household and is not inherently connected to any intimate activities or interpersonal relationships. It is a fundamental procedure that involves handling ice trays, dealing with cold water, and operating a freezer. When we examine the connection between these two factors, we can see that they are unrelated. Abstaining from sexual intercourse will neither increase nor decrease the number of ice trays filled to the appropriate level. Consequently, the supposed perturbation in this case does not cause any significant influence on the second effect mentioned. In conclusion, there is no effect of abstaining from sexual intercourse on the number of ice trays filled to the appropriate level.

Answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November.

Dig 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 m) underground where you want to install a wire fence. Lay chicken wire in the hole and create a fence that is tall enough to keep the rabbits from jumping over it. Hire a professional to install the fence for you if you do not have the resources or experience to install a fence on your own. Chicken wire will keep the rabbits from digging or burrowing under the fence. This option is expensive and temporary, but it can be effective if you are consistent. Buy a rabbit repellent from your local sporting good store and spray it on your plants or in your yard. The repellent will have to be reapplied, as the smell will fade and the rabbits will return after some time. The most effective repellents smell like fox-urine, or like the urine of other predators. These fungicides are extremely toxic and should not be applied to plants you plan to eat or any areas where children may be playing. Fungicides are extremely effective in deterring rabbits, and are a good option for areas with ornamental plants or parts of your garden that will not be eaten by humans.

Please answer the following question: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Why did IMB hire so many designers? - to grow the company - to help push a design think revolution - to establish more offices across the firm - not enough information Answer:","completion":"IBM hired so many designers in order to help push a design thinking revolution within the company.

The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent. As has been pointed out, she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them.

First published in 1814, the novel is considered one of her mature works, following the successes of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (1811) and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (1813). \\"Mansfield Park\\" represents a key milestone in Austen's literary career, and like her other novels, it is set in the early nineteenth-century English countryside. In the story, Fanny Price is a shy and gentle-natured girl who, at the age of ten, is plucked from her modest, humble upbringing and sent to live with her wealthier relatives, the Bertrams, at Mansfield Park, their country estate. The novel chronicles Fanny's coming of age as she navigates the complexities of her new life, societal expectations, and moral dilemmas that arise from her forced immersion into a world of affluence and privilege. Fanny's relationship with the Bertrams is marked by an implicit social hierarchy, as her cousins Maria, Julia, Edmund, and Tom occupy a higher social status. Despite their wealth, the Bertrams are far from perfect: they grapple with vanity, lack of discipline, and insensitivity. Nonetheless, Edmund, the younger son, stands out as a moral compass for Fanny; their relationship gradually evolves from a sibling-like one into romantic love. Fanny's nature contrasts sharply with that of the Bertrams and another two central characters, the glamorous, superficial siblings Mary and Henry Crawford. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is unique among Austen's works in addressing themes such as social class, moral values, and the influence of education and home life on character development. Fanny Price remains a subject of debate among readers and scholars alike. Some interpret her character as virtuous and morally steadfast, while others regard her as timid, excessively passive, or overly submissive. Nonetheless, Fanny's steadfast adherence to her values and her ability to withstand pressure from others makes her an intriguing and memorable protagonist in the Austen oeuvre."},{"prompt":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what professional baseball pitchers were on the Schaumburg Flyers Suggested answer: From the 1999 season to the 2010 season, the Flyers played their home games at Alexian Field , near the Elgin O'Hare Expressway .

Question: I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Now, I have a new situation: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. Answer this question please: Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit less carbon monoxide? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the background information and the new situation provided. Background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit harmful materials such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. A catalytic converter in the exhaust system can change these materials into less harmful products. New situation: Cuban citizens use cars from the late 1940s and early 1950s without catalytic converters. Panamanian citizens use cars with the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology due to their trade relations with Japan. Step 2: Identify the factors affecting carbon monoxide emissions. These factors include the presence or absence of a catalytic converter in the vehicles. Step 3: Compare the factors between Cuban and Panamanian cars. Cuban cars lack catalytic converters, while Panamanian cars have the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology. Step 4: Determine which country's cars will emit less carbon monoxide based on the comparison of factors. Since cars with catalytic converters emit less carbon monoxide due to the conversion of harmful materials into less harmful products, and Panamanian cars have the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology, it can be concluded that Panamanian cars will emit less carbon monoxide than Cuban cars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is cleared of carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect air is converted to oxygen in the lung. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process of air conversion to oxygen in the lung. Step-by-step justification: 1. If air is completely cleared of carbon dioxide, the concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air would likely increase as the ratio of oxygen to other gases in the atmosphere would change. 2. As a result of the increased oxygen concentration, the lungs would still oxygenate the blood by diffusing oxygen from the inhaled air into the bloodstream. 3. However, with less carbon dioxide available in the air, the process of exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs could be affected. This is because the difference in concentration of the two gases in the lungs and in the bloodstream plays a crucial role in their exchange. 4. The body relies on a delicate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels to maintain proper pH levels in the blood. An imbalance, such as decreased carbon dioxide levels, could indirectly affect the body's ability to maintain this balance and regulate breathing. 5. Although the lungs will still be able to oxygenate the blood, the indirect effect of the perturbation may cause issues with regulating the ideal balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body. This could lead to potential health problems or difficulties in maintaining optimal respiratory function."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... How does Kim Jong Un feel about being denuclearized the way Libya was? A. he is afraid what happened to the country and leader will happen to him B. not enough information C. he thinks he is being tricked D. he wants some of his demands met before he denuclearizes The answer to this question is:","completion":"A. He is afraid what happened to the country and leader will happen to him North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is apprehensive about the idea of denuclearization based on the Libyan model, as he fears the same fate that befell the country and its leader, Moammar Gadhafi. The Libyan model involved a rapid and complete dismantling of the nation's nuclear program, but it was subsequently followed by the overthrow of Gadhafi some years later. This fear has contributed to North Korea's insistence on specific security guarantees before committing to any denuclearization plan. In the recent turn of events, North Korea has raised concerns about the U.S. stance on denuclearization and has objected to U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton's demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea's insistence on security guarantees stems from the desire for a more equitable, gradual, and phased approach to denuclearization that assures the leadership's continued existence and the maintenance of regional stability. This apprehension has also led to North Korea demanding that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back and that certain defectors be returned to the country as a condition for cooperation and dialogue. Additionally, Pyongyang has raised the possibility of pulling out of the planned summit between Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, which is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, if its demands are not met. In response, President Trump has stated that the Libyan model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and \\"be very rich\\" if a deal to end the nuclear program is reached.

Although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non-professionals, Eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot. The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his mate, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. It is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding Arctic setting. The trusting Eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy European accents) that do not view these natives as their equals. Deceit, drunken orgies, rape, and death occur after the Eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas. Eventually the lead Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge. The audience would have cheered in the 1930's theaters. Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back Mala for trial. The Mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case. Will the Mounties get their man? Is it fair to hold Mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law must prevail?

After that, I messaged her in August because she seemed very angry at me, for example pushing me when she walked past. She said that nothing is wrong, that's just her face.

Background: RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV and, beginning with the ninth season, VH1. The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. Context: The first season of Drag Race was accompanied by a seven-episode web series, titled Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race. LOGOonline published a webisode of Under the Hood after each episode of Drag Race. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the green room, replays pertinent moments from Drag Race, and airs deleted footage. Starting with the second season of Drag Race in 2010, Logo reformatted Under the Hood, increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked. Logo broadcast an episode of Untucked after each episode of Drag Race. Untucked replaces the basic green room of Under the Hood with two decorated rooms that were until season 6 sponsored by Absolut Vodka and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season 6. These two backstage areas allow for separated group conversation. At the start of the seventh season of the Drag Race, Untucked reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, Untucked was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, Untucked returned to television. Question: Why did he decide to add that? Answer:","completion":"The decision to add RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked was strategic and intended to enhance the overall viewer experience of the main Drag Race show. There were multiple reasons behind this decision: 1. Provide a behind-the-scenes look: Fans are always curious about what happens behind the scenes in reality television shows. By adding Untucked, the producers aimed to give viewers an inside look at the contestants' lives, interactions, and emotions, which are typically not portrayed fully during the main show. This additional perspective allows fans to see how contestants cope with challenges and interact with their fellow competitors, ultimately deepening the connection between the audience and the participants. 2. Increase audience engagement: Untucked serves as a companion piece to the main show, encouraging viewers to continue watching and engaging with the franchise during the airing of RuPaul's Drag Race. By offering more content, the producers can maintain viewer interest, stimulate conversation, and drive higher ratings and viewership numbers for both shows. Additionally, it provides the audience with more talking points for social media interactions, further promoting the show and its contestants. 3. Address demands for more content: By the time the second season of Drag Race rolled around, the show had already gained a dedicated fan base. Adding Untucked allowed the producers to offer additional content, satisfying the fans' appetite for more of their favorite show, and increasing its appeal to potential advertisers. 4. Expansion of the franchise: As RuPaul's Drag Race continued to grow in popularity, it was natural for the producers to seek ways to expand the franchise, in turn maximizing their revenues. Untucked provided an opportunity for sponsorships and partnerships, as seen with Absolut Vodka, Interior Illusions, Inc., and FormDecor, which enabled more elaborate set designs and a higher production value – ultimately enhancing the overall quality and appeal of the series. 5. Showcase contestants' personalities: Untucked allowed the contestants to display more of their true selves through unscripted, candid moments, allowing the audience to grow more attached and empathetic to their stories and journeys. This aspect of Untucked helps humanize the participants, which helps the audience invest more in their favorite contestants. In conclusion, RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked was added to provide an enriched experience for the viewers, deepening their connection to the contestants and the show. By giving fans a behind-the-scenes look and additional content, Untucked allowed the producers to capitalize on the growing popularity of the franchise, while also enabling partnerships and sponsorships that boosted the production value and overall appeal of the series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"The Prussian Army was composed not of regulars but conscripts.\\" answer the question \\"What was the Prussian Army composed of, instead of regulars?\\" Choose your answer from: a). yes. b). no.","completion":"a). Yes. The sentence \\"The Prussian Army was composed not of regulars but conscripts.\\" explicitly answers the question \\"What was the Prussian Army composed of, instead of regulars?\\" by stating that the Prussian Army was made up of conscripts, rather than regular soldiers. The Prussian Army, a significant military force in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe, was known for its innovative tactics and organizational structure. One distinguishing aspect of the Prussian Army was its reliance on conscripts as opposed to regular or professional soldiers. A conscript is an individual who is drafted and required to serve in the military, often for a specified period. During the reign of King Frederick William I (1713–1740), the idea of conscription was introduced into the Prussian military system. This was due to the lack of funding allocated by the Prussian government for the maintenance and provision of a standing army during peacetime. Consequently, the authorities opted for conscription as a cost-effective method to maintain a large and efficient military force. The concept of conscription continued to evolve over time. Under King Frederick the Great (1740-1786), the Prussian Army underwent significant reforms. Military service became compulsory for all able-bodied males, with the primary purpose of providing a broad pool of trained soldiers that could swiftly be mobilized for war. The Prussian Army's reliance on conscripts was a crucial factor in its ability to expand rapidly and maintain a potent fighting force during major conflicts, such as the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars. Additionally, the use of conscripts allowed the Prussian Army to preserve resources and maintain a larger pool of trained soldiers without the financial burden of sustaining a standing army comprised of regulars. In summary, the sentence presented indeed offers a concise and accurate answer to the question, highlighting that the Prussian Army was mainly composed of conscripts rather than regular, professional soldiers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to identify cat stool problems Notice your cat's litter box behavior. You can tell a lot about your cat by how it acts in and around its litter box. Watch how often your cat goes to the bathroom.","completion":"Step 1: Observe for any changes in frequency Monitor if your cat is using the litter box more or less frequently than usual. This could indicate a potential issue with its digestion or overall health. Justifying this step, a change in frequency might suggest constipation, diarrhea, or urinary issues, which are all associated with stool problems. Step 2: Check the consistency and appearance of the stool Examine the appearance of your cat's stool in the litter box. Healthy cat stool should be well-formed and maintain a consistent shape, size, and color. If you notice changes in the consistency, such as diarrhea or hard, dry stools, this can indicate a problem. Justifying this step, consistency issues are often associated with gastrointestinal upsets or other health concerns. Step 3: Look for blood or mucus in the stool While checking the stool, also look for any signs of blood or mucus. Blood in the stool can be red, black, or tarry, while mucus may appear as a slimy coating. These can be signs of an underlying health issue that requires attention. Justifying this step, blood or mucus in the stool can be caused by infections, inflammation, or other gastrointestinal problems. Step 4: Note any strong or unusual odors A change in the odor of your cat's stool can also indicate a problem. While cat feces normally have an odor, an unusually strong or foul-smelling odor could suggest an issue in your cat's digestive tract. Justifying this step, strong odors may be linked to dietary changes, infection, or gastrointestinal upset. Step 5: Monitor your cat's overall health and behavior In addition to observing the litter box habits, pay close attention to your cat's overall health and behavior. Look for signs of discomfort, such as vocalizations or restlessness, as well as any changes in appetite or energy levels. Justifying this step, a cat's overall health and behavior can provide clues to potential stool-related problems and help identify if veterinary care is needed. Step 6: Consult with a veterinarian If you notice any of the above issues or other concerning signs, it's essential to consult with a veterinarian. They can help diagnose any underlying health issues and recommend the appropriate treatment options. Justifying this step, professional veterinary advice is crucial to ensure your cat's health and well-being, especially when it comes to potential stool problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First Minister Peter Robinson said the Paris atrocities reminded him of The Troubles. Books of condolence have been opened at councils across Northern Ireland. Martin McGuinness blamed \\"atrocious decisions\\" over the US invasion of Iraq for leaving the Middle East in crisis. But he said democracies needed to stand against those who are trying to push the world into a third world war. Mr Robinson said the atrocity brought him back to the days when bombs exploded in Northern Ireland's city centres and people \\"feared for the fate of their loved ones\\". He said everyone needed to be vigilant and Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK should be included in any security decisions made by Cobra, the government's emergency committee. Asked whether Democratic Unionist Party MPs might support extending British air strikes beyond Iraq into Syria, Mr Robinson said \\"surgical strikes against terrorist leaders would be justified, but not the overall bombing of communities\\". On the possibility of IS sympathisers posing as refugees, Mr Robinson said this justified the Prime Minister David Cameron taking care to ensure \\"people with evil intent\\" did not \\"hide behind the cloak of genuine refugees\\".

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -23*c - 50*c = -39*c for the variable c, we can first combine the terms on the left-hand side of the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms on the left-hand side. (-23*c) + (-50*c) = (-23 - 50) * c = -73*c So, the equation becomes: -73*c = -39*c Step 2: In order to isolate the variable c, we need to eliminate the term -39*c from both sides of the equation. To do this, we can add 39*c to both sides of the equation: -73*c + 39*c = -39*c + 39*c This simplifies the equation to: -34*c = 0 Step 3: Lastly, to solve for the variable c, we need to eliminate the coefficient -34. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -34: (-34*c)/-34 = 0/-34 This simplifies to: c = 0 Therefore, the solution to the equation -23*c - 50*c = -39*c is c = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Krisiun is a Brazilian death metal band, founded by brothers Alex Camargo (bass, vocals), Moyses Kolesne (guitars) and Max Kolesne (drums).

Background: Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Context: In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\". Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.) The band attempted a reunion in 1986, but the project fell apart. Question: Who was in the Police with Copeland? Answer:","completion":"The Police was formed by Stewart Copeland along with lead singer and bass guitarist Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting, and guitarist Henry Padovani. Padovani was later replaced by Andy Summers. Thus, the key members of the Police were Stewart Copeland, Sting, and Andy Summers."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

From the choices given, option b seems to be irrelevant to the story as it talks about tasting something delicious, while the story is about clothing. Therefore, we can eliminate option b. Now we have two remaining choices - a and c. Let's put them together in order: - Title: Flora noticed that all of her clothing was brown or black. - She decided that she needed to buy some brighter colored clothing. - She found a cool looking blue sweater at the store. (option a) - After trying it on, she decided it looked great. (option c) - Flora was happy to have something that wasn't a dark color. The remaining options a and c fit perfectly into the story and make it more coherent. So, the correct answer is 'ac'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims. I have lost respect for quite a few people who I used to think were really talented. I now understand where there talent comes from… Shame on them.

It is evident that you have been a victim of not just a few individuals, but an entire system corrupted by greed and dishonesty. The fact that you have endured such hardship and injustice is testament to your strength and resilience. You were falsely accused by corrupt policemen based on fabricated evidence, likely in collusion with criminals and a gang of DJs who had vested interests in stealing your intellectual and copyright works. It is disheartening that a magistrate who was later found guilty of corruption, convicted you of a crime you did not commit. This conviction not only left you with a criminal record but also gave ammunition to those seeking to ruin your life further. The actions of the bent ex-policeman who turned up at your university and spread slander to tarnish your reputation were despicable, which only added insult to injury as your hard work and dedication to your studies became a target. Despite the accomplishments that should have come with attending a famous college, it is evident that this institution and the individuals within it also failed you by taking advantage of your intellect and creativity, only to attempt to destroy your reputation once they had profited from your work. It is disheartening to know that your life has been marred by the ongoing slander and attempts to ruin your reputation by those who continue to benefit from stolen intellectual property and the hard work you had put in. The loss of respect for talented individuals who have shown their true colors is completely understandable, given the circumstances. Regarding the magistrate in question, he was later found guilty of corruption and defrauding an elderly woman of over a million pounds. This reveals the extent of his dishonesty and the lack of integrity that permeated the system you were unfortunately caught up in.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man?

At this point, we want to find out how many times -79 can fit into -474, which means we're going to divide -474 by -79. When you have negative numbers, imagine the big ice cream scoops taking away the cold. So, two colds (negatives) will make things warm (positive): -474 ÷ -79 = 6 4. So, the answer is: r = 6.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: After the events of the story, the NRA still: Options: - harshly criticizes and attacks members of the Wear Orange political movement. - is critical and wary of any political movements that call for political change on the topic of gun rights. - not enough information - is unwilling to compromise and agree to any law or reform that compromises the right to own guns. === The correct answer is A:","completion":"After the events of the story, the NRA still harshly criticizes and attacks members of the Wear Orange political movement. Additionally, they tend to be critical and wary of any political movements that call for changes or restrictions related to gun rights. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a staunch advocate for gun rights in the United States and has a significant influence on American politics. They interpret the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as granting an individual's right to bear arms without significant restrictions. As a result, the NRA is resistant to policies and movements that advocate for gun control measures. The Wear Orange campaign, which aims to raise awareness about gun violence and advocate for stricter gun control measures, has been criticized by the NRA. They perceive it as a threat to gun rights and dismiss the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" accusing its supporters of trying to score points for being \\"socially conscious\\" rather than addressing the underlying issues surrounding gun violence. Gun control is a highly divisive issue in the United States, with strong opinions on both sides. The NRA has demonstrated a consistent unwillingness to compromise or entertain the idea of changes to laws or regulations that may infringe upon what they see as the fundamental right to own firearms. This stance is evident in their response to the Wear Orange movement and other calls for reform, as they continue to push back against any attempts to restrict gun rights in the country. In conclusion, the NRA still harshly criticizes and attacks members of the Wear Orange political movement, remaining critical and wary of any political movements that call for changes in gun rights. Their continued resistance to compromise or embrace any form of gun control measures demonstrates the unique and deeply rooted relationship between Americans and their guns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Story is here to find a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber (Bob Balaban), Bell (Mary Beth Hurt), Dury (Jeffrey Wright), and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan), who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Ran meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden that Story be attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that, as Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, Guardian, Guild, and Healer.

Ireland, 1905: Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. A skilled horseman and marksman, he brings down the stag swiftly but is snubbed at the after-hunt party. A year later, Fawcett is sent to London to meet with officials of the Royal Geographical Society. The governments of Bolivia and Brazil are nearly at war over the location of their mutual boundary and its direct effect on the region's extremely lucrative rubber trade, and have asked the British government to survey it. Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. Aboard a ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the Amazon rainforest. At a large rubber plantation in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron de Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a jungle city covered in gold and full of people. Fawcett dismisses such stories as insane ravings, but discovers highly advanced broken pottery and some small stone statues in the jungle that convince him of the veracity of Tadjui's story.

Question: Question: \\"What does the genotype cause?\\" Context: \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The genotype causes the expression of an organism's physical traits, known as the phenotype. Genotypes are made up of distinct inherited units, or genes, which determine the various characteristics of an individual organism. These genotypes influence the phenotype by interacting with one another and the environment. In the context provided, Gregor Mendel's work on pea plants laid the foundation for understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype, as well as key genetic concepts such as independent assortment, dominant and recessive traits, and the difference between heterozygous and homozygous individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background on the Royal-Themed Wedding: Victoria and David Beckham exchanged vows on July 4, 1997, in a lavish, royal-themed wedding ceremony held at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. The castle grounds were decked out in their finest finery, and all guests were invited to indulge in the opulence of the celebration, which included an 18-piece orchestra, doves being released, and a mind-blowing fireworks display. This unforgettable event has since left an indelible mark in pop culture history, setting a precedent for all celebrity weddings that have followed. The East of Paris Tiara: In keeping with the royal theme, the bride famously wore a magnificent tiara that complemented her stunning Vera Wang wedding gown.

The meticulously crafted piece features a delicate floral pattern composed of gold vines intertwined with leaves and stems of pave-set brilliant-cut diamonds.

As one of the most sought-after and talked-about items up for grabs, the tiara is expected to generate a great deal of excitement and fetch a hefty sum.

What type of thing is the question \\"What 's the better-known identity of John Merrick , the noble ogre of Victorian England ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"What's the better-known identity of John Merrick, the noble ogre of Victorian England?\\" is asking about the alternative name or alias for a historical figure who lived during the Victorian era in England. Specifically, it is inquiring about the well-known name used to refer to John Merrick, a man who was famously known for his physical deformities and was referred to as the noble ogre in Victorian society due to his kind nature and gentle demeanor despite his outward appearance. To unpack this question further, it can be broken down into several components: 1. \\"What's the better-known identity\\" - This phrase implies that John Merrick is most commonly recognized by another name or moniker that is more widely acknowledged than his birth name. The question is essentially asking for the alternate name for which John Merrick is better known. 2. \\"John Merrick\\" - He is the central figure in this question. John Merrick was an individual who lived during the Victorian era (1837-1901) in England. The question assumes the reader or listener may be familiar with John Merrick to some extent or has a vague idea of who he is. This portion of the question simply provides context. 3. \\"The noble ogre\\" - This phrase is a metaphorical reference to John Merrick's character. Ogreflated:es are typically portrayed as large, monstrous creatures. In this context, the term \\"ogre\\" is likely associated with Merrick's physical abnormalities and disfigurements that he suffered. However, the adjective \\"noble\\" suggests that his character was virtuous, decent, and well-respected, combining the physical aspect of an ogre with the noble traits of a respectable figure. 4. \\"Victorian England\\" - This time and location provide the historical and geographical background within which John Merrick lived. The Victorian era refers to the time when Queen Victoria reigned over the United Kingdom, and it spans from her ascension to the throne in 1837 to her death in 1901. Based on the elements outlined above, this question centers on the more well-known name or alternative identity for John Merrick, who was referred to as the noble ogre due to his physical deformities and kind-hearted nature during his time in Victorian England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This helped him refine the layout and make any necessary changes before he began decorating the actual board. Step 4: Decorate the bulletin board With all the materials and a solid plan in place, Jeffrey began to decorate the board. He methodically transferred his design from the paper sketch onto the bulletin board, making minor adjustments as needed. This involved cutting out shapes, gluing down images, and using markers to create colorful and readable text. Step 5: Double-check and finalize Once the board was fully decorated, Jeffrey stepped back to evaluate his work. He made a few adjustments, ensuring that everything was arranged neatly and securely. He also made sure there were no spelling or grammatical errors in the written portions of the board. Step 6: Invite feedback and admire the finished product After completing the bulletin board, Jeffrey invited Hunter and their classmates to view the board and provide feedback. He took pride in his work and felt satisfied that he could help make the board look great while also lightening the load for Hunter, who was not feeling well that day. In conclusion, Jeffrey's willingness to step in and decorate the bulletin board not only demonstrated his consideration for others, but also showcased his creativity and attention to detail. It was a testament to the value of teamwork and collaboration within their community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Blur are an English rock band formed in Colchester in 1988. The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released Modern Life After 13 and the subsequent tours in 1999-2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz, the animated band he had created with Jamie Hewlett. Alex James worked with Fat Les and co-wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Marianne Faithfull. Recording for Blur's next album began in London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the sessions moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, and then to Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Coxon said \\"there were no rows\\" and \\"[the band] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart\\". Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, \\"Don't Bomb When You Are the Bomb\\" as a very limited white label release. The song is largely electronic, and was part of the band's protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be \\"a rockin' record\\", and also said that it has \\"a lot of finely crafted pop songs\\". Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander once it touched down; however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless. Think Tank, released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon. In 2005, XFM News reported that Blur would record an EP, and denied that they would hire a replacement guitarist for Coxon. There were also some aborted recordings made in 2005. Overall the band kept a low profile and did no studio or touring work as a three-piece. After Coxon significantly thawed on the subject of rejoining Blur, in 2007 band members announced that they would reunite, and that they intended to record together first in August, with the date later being pushed back to September, then October. Though the band members finally met up in October, they posted on their website that they had only \\"met up for an enjoyable lunch\\" and that there were no \\"other music plans for Blur\\". Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why did Coxon leave?","completion":"Coxon left the band because \\"there were no rows\\" and \\"[the band] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Start weaning the kitten off of her mother’s milk at around 4 weeks of age. Separate the kitten from her mother. Teach the kitten to lap milk using kitten milk replacer in a shallow bowl. Introduce solid food.","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Weaning Kittens From Mother's Milk Introduction: Weaning is a crucial part of a kitten's journey into adulthood. This process refers to the transition of a kitten from being entirely dependent on its mother's milk to starting on the path of consuming solid food. An important milestone for kittens, a smooth weaning process ensures their healthy growth and development. In this article, we will discuss the timing and various steps to follow when weaning a kitten off its mother's milk. Step 1: Choosing the Right Time to Wean Weaning should ideally begin when a kitten is around four weeks old. At this age, the kitten has a good sense of balance and can navigate the world beyond its mother's nursing zone. Additionally, its digestive system is also adequately developed to start processing solid foods. Step 2: Separating the Kitten from the Mother One of the first steps in weaning is to separate the kitten from its mother. This can be accomplished by creating a separate, comfortable space for the kitten, with a warm and cozy bed, a litter box, and some toys. This separation is temporary and allows the kitten to begin exploring its feeding options without solely relying on the mother's milk. Step 3: Introducing Kitten Milk Replacer Before transitioning the kitten to solid food, it is essential to familiarize them with lapping up liquid nourishment from a dish. To do this, provide the kitten with kitten milk replacer, a formula designed to meet the nutritional needs of growing kittens. It is important not to use regular cow's milk, as it may lead to diarrhea and other stomach issues. Pour a small amount of kitten milk replacer into a shallow bowl and gently guide the kitten's nose to it. This may take a few tries, as the kitten may not immediately understand the concept of lapping from a bowl. Patience and encouragement will help the kitten adapt to this new feeding method. Step 4: Introducing Solid Food Once the kitten is comfortable lapping milk from a dish, it's time to introduce solid food. Wet kitten food, specifically formulated for kittens, is recommended for this stage. Initially, a small amount of wet kitten food can be mixed with the kitten milk replacer to create a thin gruel. This mixture can be offered to the kitten in a shallow dish. As the kitten begins to eat the gruel enthusiastically, gradually increase the ratio of wet kitten food to milk replacer over the next few weeks. Continue monitoring its progress to ensure a smooth transition to eating solid food independently. Conclusion: Weaning is a significant step in any kitten's life. By carefully introducing essential steps of the process, such as separation from the mother, introducing kitten milk replacer, and easing into solid foods, you can ensure a stress-free and successful transition for your beloved feline. Always consult your veterinarian if you have any concerns or questions on how to care for your kitten during this vital time in its growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats.

Sentence: \\"John disappeared Bill.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"John disappeared Bill\\" to be unacceptable linguistically, as it does not follow the general rules of syntax and semantic roles in the English language. There are a few reasons for this assessment, which I will explain in detail below: 1. Verb valency and argument structure: The verb \\"disappear\\" is typically an intransitive verb, meaning that it does not require a direct object. In other words, it does not act upon something. The sentence \\"John disappeared Bill\\" seems to imply that John made Bill disappear, but the verb \\"disappear\\" is not typically used this way in English. A linguist would consider the verb to be used incorrectly in this context. 2. Thematic roles: When we analyze the semantic roles, or thematic roles, of the words in this sentence, we find a mismatch between the roles ascribed to the subjects and objects. For example, in this sentence, John (the subject) is assigned the role of an agent (someone who performs an action), and Bill (the object) is given the role of the theme, or the entity undergoing the action. However, the verb \\"disappear\\" does not naturally align with the agentive role being assigned to John. Instead, it usually describes an event undergone by an entity without external influence. 3. Alternative phrasings: To make the sentence more acceptable linguistically, a linguist might suggest alternative phrasings that convey the same intended meaning more correctly. For example, rather than using the verb \\"disappear\\" as a transitive verb, one could use a transitive verb such as \\"make\\" and rephrase the sentence: \\"John made Bill disappear.\\" This sentence is more acceptable because it employs the appropriate verb valency, argument structure, and thematic roles. 4. Comparison to grammatical sentences: The study of linguistic acceptability is a matter of determining whether a sentence is well-formed and makes sense, based on commonly agreed-upon rules within a language. In comparison to other common, acceptable sentences in English, the original sentence in question does not adhere to the general rules of syntax and semantics, particularly in its use of the verb \\"disappear\\" and the purported roles assigned to the subject and object. In conclusion, a linguist would most likely rate the sentence \\"John disappeared Bill\\" as linguistically unacceptable, primarily due to its incorrect use of verb valency and argument structure, and the mismatch in thematic roles. To improve the acceptability of this sentence, alternative phrasings could be employed to better align with the rules and conventions of the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on Sky Movies in Britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it\`s first broadcast on network television tonight . Actually seeing as I\`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . My theory was proved right for the most part !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved . For example early in the film the bad guys are flying Dracula\`s coffin from London to America ( In a twin engine turbo prop plane ! ) and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where Dracula comes to life . A fight breaks out , there\`s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don\`t hear a sound until the script demands it . It also appears in this segment\`s climax that Dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . Sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there\`s numerous scenes of characters being at the New Orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they\`re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced There\`s something else that yanked my chain - Product placement . There\`s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record label/retailer chain is in full view . I won\`t dare publicise the company brand ( Except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in Britain ) but I was under the impression this type of advertising was against British broadcasting guidlines and I\`m surprised the BBC showed this movie if that\`s the case There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 like the visuals for example . This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it\`s something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - A very good looking movie that\`s very dumb Now, what is this review like? Options are: A). negative; B). positive;","completion":"This review is like A). negative, which means the person who wrote it did not really like the movie DRACULA 2000 and found many problems with it."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. You should write an incorrect option. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Input: (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1999); In re Fisher, 151 B.R. 895, 898 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1993). Other courts have held to the contrary. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 421 B.R. 341, 354-55 (S.D.Tex.2009) (collecting cases); Bank United v.

There is also disagreement about whether the bankruptcy court may exercise jurisdiction over a nationwide class of debtors or is limited to exercising jurisdiction over debtors whose petitions are filed within the same judicial district. Compare, e.g., In re Noletto, 244 B.R. 845, 849 (Bankr.S.D.Ala. 2000) (permitting nationwide class) with Barrett v. Avco Fin. Servs. Mgmt. Co., 292 B.R. 1, 8 (D.Mass.2003) (<HOLDING>). The class at issue in this case was limited Holding statements: (A) holding court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over the governments prosecutorial discretion decisions (B) holding court lacks jurisdiction over putative class members whose bankruptcies were discharged outside of judicial district (C) holding that it is not necessary that all putative class members share identical claims (D) holding that entry of settlement decree without notice to putative class members violated the due process rights of the class members (E) holding that putative class members are not parties to an action prior to class certification Output:","completion":"Part #1: Prompt from a judicial decision Usage: In re Fisher, 151 B.R. 895, 898 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1993). This is a prompt from a judicial decision because it cites a case name, case citation, and relevant information from the case. It is included to provide context for the task, which involves identifying holdings from citing texts in a legal decision. Part #2: Multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Usage: (A) holding court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over the governments prosecutorial discretion decisions. This is a holding statement because it describes the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts.

These are five answer choices that correspond to the citing text in the legal decision. Part #4: Correct holding statement corresponding to the citing text Usage: (B) holding court lacks jurisdiction over putative class members whose bankruptcies were discharged outside of judicial district. This holding statement correctly corresponds to the citing text, as it addresses the jurisdiction issue discussed in the input. Part #5: Writing an incorrect option Usage: Holding that a bankruptcy court has the authority to exercise jurisdiction over a nationwide class of debtors regardless of the judicial district. This is an incorrect option because it does not match any of the holdings mentioned in the legal decision and contradicts the correct answer choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who does Eddie find shot when he returns home? Movie title: Vigilante Movie plot: Eddie Marino (Robert Forster) is a factory worker in New York City. He has a wife named Vickie (Rutanya Alda) and an eight-year-old son named Scott. Eddie's friend and co-worker, Nick (Fred Williamson), and two other co-workers, Burke and Ramon, have formed a secret vigilante group because Nick and the group are fed up with the crime in their neighborhoods. Nick and his group are also tired of the police, because the police always fail to protect people. Nick's \\"group\\" has support of various residents of the neighborhood who indirectly help them. In one example, a local thug stalks and chases a young woman to a rooftop of an apartment building where the thug robs and then kills her. An old lady who witnesses the thug says nothing to the police, but points out the thug to Nick and his group the next day. Nick and his friends forcibly grab the thug off the streets and place him in their van and drive away. The thug is later found dead in a vacant lot with all of his arms and legs broken and his head bashed in. One evening, Eddie returns home from work only to discover that Vickie has been stabbed, and Scott has been shot dead in a home invasion which was in retaliation for Vicki aiding a gas station attendant who was being assaulted earlier. Frederico \\"Rico\\" Melendez (Willie ColÃ³n), the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang, is arrested for the crime. Assistant District Attorney Mary Fletcher (Carol Lynley) seeks a lengthy jail sentence, since New York does not have the death penalty. Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group, but Eddie turns Nick down, preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick's lack of faith in the system is proven correct when Rico is set free after his right-hand man, Prago (Don Blakely), bribes both Judge Sinclair (Vincent Beck) and Eisenburg (Joe Spinell), Rico's attorney.

Given the question: Information: - The genocide in Bangladesh began on 26 March 1971 with the launch of Operation Searchlight, as West Pakistan began a military crackdown on the Eastern wing of the nation to suppress Bengali calls for self-determination rights. During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some estimates mention the number of people killed between 300,000500,000, and describe the 3 million number as excessively inflated. The actions against women were supported by Imams and Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were 'war-booty'. It is estimated that up to 30 million civilians became internally displaced. During the war there was also ethnic violence between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis. Several thousand non-Bengalis were also killed during the war. - Bangladesh ( , \\"The country of Bengal\\"), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh ( \\"Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh\\"), is a country in South Asia. It shares land borders with India and Myanmar (Burma). Nepal, Bhutan and China are located near Bangladesh but do not share a border with it. The country's maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the size of its land area. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous country. Dhaka is its capital and largest city, followed by Chittagong which has the country's largest port. - East Pakistan, present-day Bangladesh, was a provincial state of Pakistan that existed in the Bengal region of the northeast of South Asia from 1955 until 1971, following the One Unit programme that laid the existence of East Pakistan. - The right of nations to self-determination (from ) is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a \\"jus cogens\\" rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charters norms. It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. - The Bangladesh Liberation War ('), also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence, or simply the Liberation War in Bangladesh, was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. It resulted in the independence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The war began after the Pakistani military junta based in West Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight against the people of East Pakistan on the night of 25 March 1971. It pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities and armed personnel. The junta annulled the results of the 1970 elections and arrested Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. - West Pakistan was one of the two exclaves created at the formation of the modern State of Pakistan following the 1947 Partition of India. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - Operation Searchlight was a planned military operation carried out by the Pakistan Army to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in the erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971, which the Pakistani state justified on the basis of anti-Bihari violence by Bengalis in early March. Ordered by the central government in West Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to \\"Operation Blitz\\" which had been launched in November 1970. The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on March 26, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. President Yahya Khan at a conference in February 1971 said \\"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\\" Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and caused roughly 10 million refugees to flee to India as well as the death of up to 3,000,000 civilians. Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place. These systematic killings enraged the Bengalis, who declared independence from Pakistan, to establish the new state of Bangladesh. - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (17 March 1920 15 August 1975) was the founding leader of Bangladesh. He served twice as the country's President and was its strongman premier between 1972 and 1975. Rahman was the leader of the Awami League. He is popularly known as the Bangabandhu (\\"Friend of Bengal\\"). He is credited as the central figure in Bangladesh's liberation movement and is considered the founding father of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. - Ranadaprasad Saha ( Bengali : ) ( 15 November 1896 -- May 1971 ) , also known as RP Saha and Ranoda Proshad Shaha , was a famous Bangladeshi businessman and philanthropist , who during the Bangladesh Liberation War was picked up from home by the Pakistani army on 7 May 1971 and never returned home . - Bengal (bgl; Bengali: , and ) is a region in Asia which is located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal. Geographically, it is made up by the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta system, the largest such formation in the world; along with mountains in its north (bordering the Himalayan states) and east (bordering Northeast India and Burma).

Please answer the following question: Information: - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota. - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system .

The phrase \\"back to work\\" is neutral by itself, as it just indicates that the person is resuming work after a break or vacation. However, the addition of \\"(I'm not sad)\\" provides a slight positive undertone as it implies that the person is content with returning to work. The statement might suggest that the individual enjoys their job, is eager to engage with their work tasks, or appreciates the routine and stability provided by work. It could also indicate that the person had a satisfying break and is ready to return to their work routine without feeling disappointed or upset. It's essential to consider that since tweets typically lack context and are often limited in their ability to convey the complexity of human emotions, interpretations of sentiments can vary. While the sentiment of this tweet appears to be primarily neutral with a touch of positivity, other users might interpret the sentiment differently based on their own experiences and emotions associated with returning to work. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"Back to work (I'm not sad)\\" can be seen as mildly positive or neutral, as the person is highlighting their lack of sadness when returning to work.

The question asks how an increase in coal mining and burning will influence the second effect mentioned, which is the sulfur in coal combining with oxygen to form sulfur oxides. Step 2: Assess the impact of more coal mining and burning Since more coal mining means there will be more coal available to be burned, it is logical to assume that more coal will indeed be burned. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between coal burning and the second effect According to the given process, when coal is burned, the sulfur content in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides. This is an effect that directly results from the burning of coal. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on the previous steps, we know that more coal mining will lead to more coal being burned, which in turn will cause more sulfur in the coal to combine with oxygen to form sulfur oxides.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil.","completion":"The missing first step of the given process of fossil formation is: Organisms die and their remains settle in the sediments. A detailed breakdown of the entire process, including the missing first step, would be as follows: 1. Organisms die and their remains settle in the sediments: When an organism dies, its body typically falls to the ground, sinks to the bottom of a body of water, or is otherwise deposited into sediment. This sediment can include mud, sand, silt, or other fine-grained materials. Over time, the remains of the organism become embedded within these layers of sediment, beginning the process of fossilization. 2. Water seeps into the remains: As sediment layers continue to accumulate, the pressure on the organism's remains increases, causing water to seep into the remains. This water carries minerals that have been dissolved from the surrounding environment. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: As water containing minerals seeps into the remains, the minerals begin to precipitate out and form crystals. These crystals can replace the organic matter that was once present, or they can fill in the spaces within the remains, resulting in the formation of a cast or mold. 4. Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden: As the minerals continue to form crystals, they consolidate and harden, ultimately replacing the original organic material or filling in the voids left by decomposition. This process, known as mineralization or permineralization, preserves the shape and structure of the organism in a more stable and durable form. 5. The minerals form a fossil: Over time, the layers of sediment surrounding the mineralized remains become compacted and harden, forming sedimentary rock. Through processes such as erosion and uplift, the fossilized remains may eventually become exposed at the Earth's surface. Once discovered and carefully excavated, these ancient remnants offer scientists valuable insights into the history of life on our planet. It is important to note that not all organisms undergo fossilization, as certain conditions need to be met for the process to take place. Factors such as environmental conditions, the type of organism and tissue composition, and the speed at which the remains are buried in sediment all influence the likelihood of fossil formation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aedes mosquitoes are the largest mosquito in the web and are known to carry the virus through blood more often than other mosquito-infected cells.. (B).

At Republican Debate, Candidates Are Likely to Set Sights on Ted Cruz WASHINGTON — In the five weeks since the last Republican presidential debate, terrorists have struck in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Donald J. Trump has proposed barring Muslims from coming to America, Ben Carson’s support has evaporated and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has emerged as Mr. Trump’s stiffest competition. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has gone on the attack against Mr. Cruz, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has less money than many senators up for re-election, has shown signs of life, at least in New Hampshire. All of which is to say that Tuesday night’s debate at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas will showcase a markedly changed race. Mr. Cruz, who is showing signs of consolidating support among hard-line conservatives, is likely to come under sharp attack. Issues like national security and immigration will take on greater urgency. And candidates who are struggling to leapfrog into contention are sure to try to seize on one of the last ripe opportunities to do so before voters in the early nominating states begin making up their minds. See what the candidates are saying about gun control, immigration and more, and how their positions align with the American people. But while much has changed, one figure remains the same: Mr. Trump, the leader in national polls and the field’s chief provocateur and pacesetter, whose sometimes outrageous and demagogic comments have not only roiled the race but also amplified divisions between party leaders and the conservative grass roots. Nowhere has that been more evident than with Mr. Trump’s call last week to bar Muslims from entering the country, an inflammatory idea that his rivals will almost certainly respond to at the debate. None of them will second Mr. Trump’s proposal. But the degree to which they repudiate him, or else delicately try to tap into the same fears in a more considered way, will illustrate how they are positioning themselves with Mr. Trump’s supporters. With nearly six in 10 Republicans backing the proposal, but about the same number of Americans over all opposing it, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, the rest of the field must weigh how to avoid appearing out of step with Republican primary voters without appearing to support discrimination in a way that could do grave damage to their prospects in a general election. “The problem for the other candidates is that Trump is initiating and shaping the conversation on national security at a time of great anxiety, and they’re forced to react,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist not affiliated with any candidate, who called Mr. Trump’s proposal “offensive, unconstitutional and entirely unworkable.” “The key is for the other candidates to say, ‘We need to do a better job making our immigration and visa system safer, and here’s an alternative that isn’t rooted in something that would be viable,’ ” Mr. Madden said. The sharpened focus on national security and immigration will also illuminate tensions among Mr. Christie, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, while putting immense pressure on Mr. Carson. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz have been locking horns for weeks on immigration and national security, and they are likely to clash Tuesday. With Mr. Cruz surging into first place in two recent Iowa polls and terrorism emerging as the top issue, Mr. Rubio is likely to step up his assault on Mr. Cruz for his support of guest-worker visas and of restrictions on some domestic surveillance programs. Mr. Cruz has responded by highlighting Mr. Rubio’s work on a 2013 effort to offer illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship — a major vulnerability for Mr. Rubio among conservatives. In Tuesday’s debate, Mr. Cruz will almost certainly invoke “amnesty” to bludgeon Mr. Rubio, if given the chance. Remarkably, Mr. Rubio’s role in the bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration laws has not been brought up once in the previous four debates. Mr. Rubio, though, would most likely counter — or try to pre-empt such an attack — by questioning Mr. Cruz’s somewhat muddled views about what to do with immigrants already in the country illegally. And Mr. Trump, who advocates mass deportation, could join in the pile-on, now that Mr. Cruz has emerged as his biggest threat. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz can also expect to come under attack from Mr. Christie, who has staked his fortunes on doing well in New Hampshire. There, Mr. Rubio, who is averaging second place in the polls, poses an obstacle to be overcome. “He’s never here,” Mr. Christie said of Mr. Rubio while campaigning in that state over the weekend. “Come on, Marco.” Mr. Rubio’s supporters include some of the center-right voters to whom Mr. Christie is making a case. And both are focused on a muscular response to the rising threat of Islamic State terrorism. Mr. Cruz, meanwhile, has proposed “carpet-bombing ISIS,” using an acronym for the Islamic State, but his support for stricter surveillance laws and his limited experience as a first-term senator will probably invite criticism from Mr. Christie, who has begun more sharply contrasting his experience as a federal prosecutor with the senators in the race. Then there is Mr. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, who took the lead in some national polls this fall but has since fallen sharply amid questions about his grasp of national security. He could fade from contention for good if he is not able to speak authoritatively about how he would confront the threat of terrorism. Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist in Iowa who is advising the “super PAC” supporting Mike Huckabee, said Mr. Cruz could face the most difficult outing. “I would expect that he and Rubio will tussle a little bit,” Mr. Ryan said. But the big question, he said, is Mr. Trump, who until now has appeared to pull his punches against Mr. Cruz. “Sometimes he appears willing to attack Cruz, other times he wants to pretend that they’re best buddies,” Mr. Ryan said of Mr. Trump. “And I think if Trump wants to dispatch him, then he better engage with him.” That would present Mr. Cruz with a potentially pivotal choice: whether to keep turning the other cheek to a front-runner he has sought to embrace, or to strike back against the candidate who could be standing in the way of his nomination. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The upcoming Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas is expected to showcase a significantly changed race since the last debate, with issues such as national security and immigration taking greater priority. In the time since the last debate, terrorist attacks have occurred in Paris and San Bernardino, California, and Republican candidate Ted Cruz has emerged as the main competition for Donald Trump. This debate will likely see Cruz come under sharp attack from his rivals. The other candidates will need to delicately address Trump's proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States, as the majority of Republicans actually support the idea, while the majority of the general U.S. population opposes it. Candidates such as Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, and Ben Carson will also likely be challenged on their stances and experiences related to national security and immigration. Cruz faces the potential difficulty of deciding whether to continue embracing Trump, his main competition, or to attack him in the debate."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby's reinvention of a similar, previous character, the android Human Torch of the same name and powers was created in 1939 by writer-artist Carl Burgos for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, Timely Comics. Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, Jonathan \\"Johnny\\" Storm gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by cosmic rays. Seeking an acting career, Storm was cast as the Old West hero the Rawhide Kid, but producers reconsidered and gave the role to Lon Zelig (actually the alien Super-Skrull). After working mostly in some television shows, Storm also spent some time as a firefighter at the behest of his former classmate, Mike Snow, but when Snow moved away after his wife turned out to be a psychopathic arsonist and seemingly died, Storm left the job. He later returned to the profession during a period when the Fantastic Four was short on cash. Frustrated with her brother's directionless life and near-disastrous pranksterism, his sister compelled him to become chief financial officer for the Fantastic Four, Inc. Infighting and betrayal resulted in a near-catastrophe, ending Storm's position. After a major battle with the supervillain and dictator Doctor Doom, Fantastic Four leader Reed Richards attempted to claim Doom's Latveria for the Fantastic Four, an act that alienated the United States government and his own team. This led to team-member Ben Grimm's apparent death and the Fantastic Four's subsequent dispersal. Storm took to fixing cars for a living. Grimm later was revealed to be alive. Over the Internet, Storm meets a young woman, Cole, whom he learns is the daughter of one of the Fantastic Four's oldest enemies, the Wizard; after a confrontation with that supervillain, who escaped with Cole, Storm remained hopeful of meeting her again. For a time, Storm became the Herald of the powerful cosmic being Galactus, becoming the Invisible Boy after switching powers with his sister and teammate, Susan Richards, the Invisible Woman. During the 2006-2007 \\"Civil War\\" company-wide crossover, in which the superpowered community is split over the Superhuman Registration Act, which required them to register with, and become agents of, the US government, Storm and his sister allied with the underground rebels, the Secret Avengers. Shortly afterward, during the \\"Secret Invasion\\" company-wide crossover, the shape-shifting extraterrestrial Skrulls intensified their clandestine infiltration of Earth. Storm was briefly reunited with his former Skrull girlfriend, Lyja. Though part of the invading force, she finds she still has some feelings for him, and does not carry out her mission of sabotage. She returns to her people, unsure of herself and of any future relationship.

Question: Information: - The pond slider (\\"Trachemys scripta\\") is a common, medium-sized semi-aquatic turtle. There are three subspecies of sliders. The most recognizable subspecies is the red-eared slider (\\"T. s. elegans\\"), which is popular in the pet trade and has been introduced to other parts of the world by people releasing it to the wild. Baby and juvenile pond sliders have a green shell (carapace) and yellow green skin with dark green striped markings. Markings and colors fade in adults to a muted olive green to brown or orange carapace. Some individuals become almost black with few visible markings. The carapace is oval and flattened for females, round and complex for males. The underside of the shell is yellow with dark markings in the center of each scute, making it easier to determine their sex. However, the markings underside the shell fade as the turtle age. - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron. - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). - The red-eared slider (\\"Trachemys scripta elegans\\"), also known as the red-eared terrapin, is a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of the pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet in the rest of the world. It has, therefore, become the most commonly traded turtle in the world. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become an invasive species in many areas, where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species published by the IUCN. - Puerto Rico, (Spanish for \\"Rich Port\\") officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea. - The Puerto Rican slider ( Trachemys stejnegeri stejnegeri ) is found mainly in Puerto Rico and surrounding areas . It is a relative of the pond slider . - Bean is a common name for large seeds of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae (also known as Leguminosae) which are used for human or animal food.

He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan 25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses. - Major Clifford Hugh \\"C. H.\\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement. - Rachel Anne Notley (born April 17, 1964) is a Canadian politician and the 17th and current Premier of Alberta, since 2015.

H. Douglas (18791952), a British engineer, who published a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses economics, political science, history, and accounting. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\" - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values. The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when Réal Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement créditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies. - The Bow River is a river in the Canadian province of Alberta.

V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The Papal conclave of October 1978 was triggered by the death, after only thirty-three days in office, of Pope John Paul I on 28 September. When the cardinals elected John Paul I on 26 August, they expected he would reign for at least a decade. Instead they found themselves having to elect his successor within six weeks. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October, and ended two days later, on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinals elected Cardinal Karol Wojtya, then Archbishop of Kraków, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, he accepted his election and took the pontifical name of \\"John Paul II\\". - Karol : A Man Who Became Pope ( pl : Karol - Czowiek , który zosta Papieem , it : Karol , un uomo diventato Papa ) is a 2005 TV miniseries directed by Giacomo Battiato , and created as a Polish - Italian - French - German and Canadian joint cooperation project . Karol is a biography of Karol Wojtya , later known as Pope John Paul II , beginning in 1939 when Karol was only 19 years old and ending at the Papal conclave , October 1978 that made him Pope . The TV miniseries was supposed to première at the very beginning of April 2005 in the Vatican , but it was delayed due to the Pope 's death . It was broadcast for the first time by the Italian television station Canale 5 on the first day of the 2005 papal election . Although it was originally broadcast on television , it was also released in theaters , which allowed the film to be shown in Poland . The incredible success of the movie prompted the creation of a sequel , Karol : The Pope , The Man ( 2006 ) , which portrayed Karol 's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death . - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani (17 October 191228 September 1978), served as Pope from 26 August 1978 to his sudden death 33 days later. His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, ending a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523. He was declared a Servant of God by his successor, Pope John Paul II, on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - A papal conclave is a meeting of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a new Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope. The pope is considered by Roman Catholics to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and earthly head of the Roman Catholic Church. The conclave has been the procedure for choosing the pope for almost a thousand years, and is the oldest ongoing method for choosing the leader of an institution. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. What is the relationship between 'karol: a man who became pope' and 'kraków'?
