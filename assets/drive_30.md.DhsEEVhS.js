This article: The crew of a malfunctioning alien cargo ship make an emergency landing on Earth. This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably. However, Willy, looking for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion and infer that he is a stronger being. While conducting a physical examination on Willy, Cosia discovers that his biology is more advanced than anything known to their species; encouraging Cosia with exaggerated claims about his sexual prowess, Willy loses his virginity to her.

Question: What is another word for higher power? Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction. Answer:","completion":"Another word for higher power in this context is \\"God.\\" Berkeley put God in the gap to explain the conditions under which groups of permanent possibilities of sensation might exist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the Barclays Premier League after the Gunners rallied to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw at Goodison. The Londoners were humbled 3-0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on Merseyside after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith gave Everton a two-goal lead going into the break. But, after Aaron Ramsey cut the deficit after 83 minutes, substitute Olivier Giroud headed a late equaliser from Nacho Monreal's cross. Scroll down for videos... On the road: Mathieu Flamini claims that Arsenal have learned how to play difficult away games. One downbeat note for the Gunners was the half-time substitution of Chilean Alexis Sanchez, their £35million summer signing, who manager Arsene Wenger felt 'struggled with the physicality' and which saw the lively Giroud brought on. But French midfielder Flamini said: 'We've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger. 'We didn't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us. It was a great performance from the team because being 2-0 down was not easy for us. Even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us.' Hope: Aaron Ramsey collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2-1 at Goodison. Game changer: Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury. Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger praised Giroud for changing the game after coming on as a second-half substitute. 'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on),' the Arsenal manager said. 'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important. 'He had a very good second half.' Unfortunately for Wenger, Giroud suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off against Besiktas. 'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot. 'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. ' Not fit enough! Alexis Sanchez was withdrawn at half-time after an ineffectual performance. Sanchez is likely to lead the line against the Turks, who gained a 0-0 draw against the Gunners in Istanbul on Wednesday. Wenger said he had no option but to withdraw the £35million signing at half-time on Saturday. 'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said. 'He knows he is not at his best physically but when he is his confidence will come back.'

That question is not difficult to answer if we change the word poetry to songs. I sing when I feel good. When I sing my favorite songs, I feel even better. Sometimes when I am listening to music and to the song words, I feel that it was written for me. A good song always makes me feel something. There are songs that I sing in my head between classes and songs that I want to sing when the school bell rings by the end of the day. They help me get through the day. _ I like songs about love and friendship. The extraordinary thing is that my feelings are more special when I sing my favorite songs in English. I also like reading. I used to avoid poetry until an e-friend told me I should recite poems and not look up the meaning of the words. Poetry uses many difficult words and idioms, but the best thing is to just forget about them. In the beginning I felt quite strange. Now I always lock the door. Reading aloud gives you a strange feeling, but when you have some practice and fall into the rhythm, and the sounds of the words, it is really a special experience. I started with small poems, but now I think I most like long poems. I have different feelings with different poems. When I have had a bad day at school, I read Keats and forget everything. When I am sad I read Wordsworth by the light of a candle. When the poem is finished, I close the book and my sadness is gone. According to the writer, _ .

Given the question \\"How would Lee feel afterwards?\\", is \\"resentful\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"resentful\\" would not typically be a valid answer in this context. Resentment is a feeling of bitter indignation due to perceived unfairness or having been wronged. In the scenario you provided, Aubrey approaches Lee, who has just lost a game, and offers them a comforting hug. This act suggests that Aubrey is attempting to console Lee or provide emotional support during a possibly difficult time. The intention here is not negative or contentious; rather, it’s a gesture of empathy and care. Usually, receiving support and empathy after experiencing a setback like losing a game would lead to feelings of gratitude, comfort, or potentially a lessening of disappointment due to the encouragement received. Lee might still feel disappointed about the loss, but they might also feel appreciative of Aubrey's gesture or reassured that they are not alone in their struggle. However, humans are complex creatures with a wide range of emotional responses. If Lee's feelings of loss and disappointment were so strong that they twisted Aubrey's comforting gesture into something negative – if, for instance, Lee viewed Aubrey's consolation as patronizing, or a reminder of their defeat – then it is possible, though not typical, for Lee to feel resentment. Furthermore, if Lee's competitive nature blocked their ability to accept the loss, they may feel resentment that Aubrey isn't taking their defeat seriously or doesn't \\"understand\\" their competitive drive. But this response would depend on the depth of Lee's competitiveness and their personal relationship with Aubrey. In general, 'resentful' wouldn't be the first emotion we would typically expect from Lee in this situation, given Aubrey's supportive approach. Instead, it would imply a more nuanced psychological reaction that might not be the most common or expected one. Without additional context to suggest this, 'resentful' does not seem to be a valid answer. More commonly, Lee would likely feel comforted, grateful, or at least less alone after Aubrey's empathetic gesture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who wrote a letter to Lieutenant Colonel L'Estrange?, using the article: William Hulton, the chairman of the magistrates watching from the house on the edge of St Peter's Field, saw the enthusiastic reception that Hunt received on his arrival at the assembly, and it encouraged him to action. He issued an arrest warrant for Henry Hunt, Joseph Johnson, John Knight, and James Moorhouse. On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major Thomas Trafford, the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange. The contents of both notes were similar: Sir, as chairman of the select committee of magistrates, I request you to proceed immediately to no. 6 Mount Street, where the magistrates are assembled. They consider the Civil Power wholly inadequate to preserve the peace. I have the honour, & c. Wm. Hulton. The notes were handed to two horsemen who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley, a local factory owner, arrived at the house from where the magistrates were watching; some reports allege that they were drunk. Andrews, the Chief Constable, instructed Birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute.

Answer choices: - sweating - attract females - Release energy - repels females - attract enemies - attract males - adding heat - dangerous Answer:","completion":"The substance that male dogs have in their urine to mark their territory primarily serves to attract females. When a male dog urinates and thus marks its territory, it's essentially leaving a message via its urine that carries a wealth of information such as the dog's health, age, and sexual status. Thus, the marked territories can be seen as advertisements to available females. The scent can be picked up by female dogs who can determine if the male dog is suitable for mating.

The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was indeed devoted to \\"the theory of radiation and quanta\\". This conference marked a key event in the history of modern physics, bringing together many of the greatest scientific minds of that time to discuss and share ideas on the cutting-edge research of radiation and the newly emerging concept of quanta. The Solvay Conference is a prestigious international conference that has been held every few years since 1911, organized by the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry. It was founded by Belgian chemist and industrialist Ernest Solvay to foster exchanges and collaborations between top scientists from different countries. The conference gained international renown for its impact on the development of quantum physics and related fields. The first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels, Belgium, and featured some of the brightest scientific minds of that era. Among the attendees were notable physicists like Max Planck, who introduced the concept of quanta in 1900, Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, and Marie Curie, who conducted groundbreaking research in radioactivity. These, along with other notable participants like Henri Poincaré, Ernest Rutherford, and Hendrik Lorentz, contributed significantly to the discussions that took place during the conference. In the context of the early 20th century, the theory of radiation and quanta was a groundbreaking topic that had the potential to revolutionize the understanding of the physical world. The discussions at the conference focused on the new concepts proposed by Max Planck and Albert Einstein on the quantization of energy and the behavior of electromagnetic radiation. The conference also saw intense debates regarding the nature of atoms, the interaction of light with matter, and the thermodynamics of radiation. The outcome of the first Solvay Conference was instrumental in setting the stage for the development of quantum mechanics, a fundamental theory in physics that would eventually replace classical mechanics for microscopic systems. Crucial developments in our understanding of atomic structure, wave-particle duality, and the uncertainty principle can be traced back to the interactions and debates held during this historic conference. In summary, the answer that the first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to \\"the theory of radiation and quanta\\" is accurate and highlights the importance of this event in shaping the course of modern physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mount Cameroon, also known as Buea Mountain or Mongo ma Ndemi, is one of Africa’s most active volcanoes. It is situated in the Southwest region of Cameroon near the Gulf of Guinea coast. This stratovolcano has had several eruptions in the past, with the most significant ones occurring in 1999 and 2000. Mount Cameroon is characterized by swift and frequent eruptions, which are mainly effusive in nature. The eruptions are typically characterized by the outpouring of lava flows from fissures along the summit and flanks, leading to the construction of parasitic cones and lava domes. Pyroclastic flows are typically not a major hazard during eruptions. Instead, lava flows and ashfall pose risks to surrounding areas, including nearby towns and villages. The 2000 eruption started on May 28 and lasted for about two months, ending in July. This eruption was similar in nature to previous eruptions at Mount Cameroon, with lava flows spewing from fissures and numerous small earthquakes preceding the eruption. The seismic activity prompted the evacuation of nearly 5,000 people from the surrounding villages of Bokosso, Bakingili, Molyko, and Limbe. The eruption resulted in substantial damage to infrastructure, particularly around the town of Bakingili, which was directly in the path of the lava flow. Significant ashfall affected nearby towns and roads, causing respiratory issues for some residents and impacting air travel. Additionally, the eruption destroyed farmland and crops, leading to food shortages in some areas. Since the 2000 eruption, Mount Cameroon has not experienced another significant eruption. However, given its history of frequent eruptions and ongoing monitoring by scientists, it is likely that Mount Cameroon will erupt again in the future. As it stands now, researchers continue to study the volcano and its associated hazards, working on developing better predictive models in order to minimize the impact on human populations when the volcano inevitably erupts again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, we need to consider the key fact: The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave. Step 1: Understand the fact The fact states that when the distance between particles is smaller, the amplitude of the wave is greater. Conversely, when the distance between particles is greater, the amplitude of the wave is smaller. Step 2: Apply the fact to the given situation Theo moves away from Gary. As a result, the distance between them increases.

In 2008, there were over 66 refugee nationalities in the county. At the 2001 UK census, 74.2% of Greater Manchesters residents were Christian, 5.0% Muslim, 0.9% Jewish, 0.7% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, and 0.1% Sikh. 11.4% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion and 7.4% did not state their religion. This is similar to the rest of the country, although the proportions of Muslims and Jews are nearly twice the national average. It contains the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, a large Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogue in North Manchester. Greater Manchester is covered by the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford and Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool.

How many percent of the total population were not an ethnic minority?","completion":"To find the percentage of the total population that were not an ethnic minority in Greater Manchester based on the 2001 data, we need to subtract the percentage of the ethnic minority population from the total population percentage. Here is the step-by-step calculation: 1. The total population is considered 100%. 2. The ethnic minority population comprises 8.5% of the total population in 2001. Now, we need to subtract the ethnic minority population percentage from the total population percentage: 100% - 8.5% = 91.5% Thus, 91.5% of the total population were not an ethnic minority in Greater Manchester in 2001."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

Geogenic processes refer to natural geological processes that occur within the Earth’s systems, such as volcanic activity, erosion, and movement of tectonic plates. These processes can have a significant impact on the environment and the Earth's surface, often leading to various forms of natural occurrences like earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.

Let's take a look at each proposition in detail: 1. \\"There are people outside.\\" - This statement gives us the information that there are individuals located in an outdoor setting. However, no specific details about this outside location are offered. We cannot infer from this statement alone that they are at the beach. They could be anywhere outside – in a park, on a mountain, on a street, etc. 2. \\"People standing on a beach, one under a green umbrella\\" - This premise is more specific. It not only tells us about the location (a beach), which is an outdoor setting, but also gives more detailed information, like the presence of an umbrella (which is green) under which one person is standing. While it's possible that these two scenarios could describe the same circumstance, that connection cannot be made from the information given. Both scenarios share the common element of people being outside, but the first lacks the specificity of the second. For the first statement to confirm the second, it would need to provide more information that aligns with the details given in the second statement. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say that the two statements are inherently connected or that one confirms the truth of the other. The statement \\"There are people outside\\" could apply to countless situations, and without additional descriptors or qualifications, we can’t conclude that those people are necessarily \\"standing on a beach, one under a green umbrella.\\" The information presented in the second premise is not contradicted by the first, but it is not explicitly supported by it either. The two statements could be related, but they could just as likely be describing completely different situations.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Which poet enjoyed the same status as important ministers in the court? , can you please find it? The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly.

They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time.\\" At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus. Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. The album includes \\"Old Shep\\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear \\"in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\\" Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from \\"That's All Right\\" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that \\"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.\\"Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28.

Summarize this article: Senior judge Lord Glennie was examining the case of a woman who is alleged to have been a victim of domestic abuse. Lawyers acting for the man accused of attacking her had wanted to access the woman's medical records. She sought legal aid for representation at the hearing, but the Scottish government refused her application. That decision has been overturned by Lord Glennie, who ruled that the woman's human rights had been breached. The ruling has been welcomed as \\"very significant\\" by anti-rape campaigners, who said many victims did not come forward as they did not want their medical records to be accessed. They also said that these records were frequently used to look for mental health issues, which was a \\"a significant violation of their privacy\\". The woman, known in court documents as WF, is the alleged victim in five of the seven charges of assault and domestic abuse faced by a man in a case at a Highland sheriff court. As part of the accused's case, defence lawyers wanted to recover all medical, psychiatric and psychological files relating to the woman over a seven-year period. But the woman maintained that such a move would infringe her human rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to privacy and family life. The woman sought legal advice, and an application was made to the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) to allow her to be represented in opposition to the recovery proceedings. To the world I epitomise the old cliche of \\"asking for it\\". I am the perfect imperfect rape victim. I was drunk. I was wearing a short skirt. I knew the man who attacked me. I willingly, albeit under false pretences, went back to his home. But nothing prepared me - or rather, no one prepared me - for the fact that my previous mental health records were going to be lambasted in a courtroom full of strangers. While cross examining me, the QC asked something that shocked me. He asked me if I had ever self-harmed in the past. I was confused. I was angry. I didn't understand. When I was a young teenager - around 13-years-old - I was bullied at high school. I was depressed. I resorted to self-harm to deal with my pain. I had only confided this detail to a school psychologist, maybe my doctor. I hadn't even told my own mother. But here, at the trial of my rapist - some seven or more years later - this incredibly personal information was being broadcast to all - journalists, the jury, the judge, and worst of all, the man who only five months prior had repeatedly raped me. Read more about Sarah Scott's ordeal But SLAB refused the application, with the woman being told that - unlike in England and Wales - there was no provision in Scotland for legal aid to be granted to enable her to oppose her records being accessed. The woman then turned to the Scottish Ministers, who can grant legal aid in circumstances not covered by the rules. But they also rejected the move, claiming that the interests of the alleged victim could be protected without the need for them to personally participate and be represented at the hearing. Lawyers acting for the woman sought a judicial review at the Court of Session, and argued that the Scottish government was preventing the woman from participating effectively in a case where own her own rights were involved. It was also maintained that without adequate safeguards to protect them, the risk of disclosure of confidential medical and psychiatric records would be another reason why sex assault victims would not report such incidents to the police. The woman was backed in her case by Rape Crisis Scotland, which said the medical records of alleged victims were increasingly being used in sexual offence prosecutions. Lawyers acting for the Scottish Ministers argued that the alleged victim had no present right to be heard. But in his written statement, Lord Glennie said: \\"That is wrong. There may be no express provision in any statute or any rule requiring intimation to be made on the complainer or requiring her to be given an opportunity to be heard. \\"But she has that right by virtue of Article 8 and the absence of any specific provision in a statute or in court rules cannot take away that right. \\"What is required is for the lack of any specific provision to be addressed by the appropriate rule-making body.\\" The judge added: \\"The appropriate course for this court is simply to reduce the decision, founded as it is on an error of law as to the complainer's right to be heard, leaving the Scottish Ministers to make a new decision on a correct legal basis.\\" Sandy Brindley of Rape Crisis Scotland said the ruling was a very significant step in protecting complainers' privacy. She added: \\"The Scottish government has a strong track record in addressing violence against women but on this issue we consider that they have taken the wrong approach. \\"No other woman should have to go through what the petitioner in this case has been through, just to have her views heard on such a fundamental breach of her privacy.\\" Summary:","completion":"A senior judge in Scotland, Lord Glennie, has ruled that the country's government breached a woman's human rights by refusing to grant her legal aid for representation in a case where her medical records were sought by her alleged domestic abuser.

In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings.

Ray also seems familiar with conflict de-escalation techniques, which could indicate that he works or has experience in a job or position where managing conflicts or dealing with people's grievances is important."},{"prompt":"Information: - Salvador Abascal ( 1910 -- 2000 ) was a Mexican politician and leading exponent of Mexican synarchism . For a time the leader of the National Synarchist Union ( UNS ) , Abascal represented the orthodox Catholic tendency within the movement . - Falangism was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \\"Falange\\"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism. - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and falangism, violently opposed to the left wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessor the National Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012.

Step 2: The Discovery - Jack receives a peculiar case involving a series of disappearances, all of which leaves the victims bewildered and cannot recall the events during their vanishing hours. - Frustrated with the lack of answers, Jack starts investigating the correlation between the cases and stumbles upon the existence of the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun. Step 3: Conflict - As Jack further investigates, he uncovers Dr. Hargreaves' plan to use the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun to rob a highly secured bank, by immobilizing the security personnel and staff, rendering them unable to stop her or remember her actions. Step 4: Meeting the Antagonist - Jack confronts Dr. Hargreaves about her invention and intentions, but is shot by the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun himself. He subsequently loses his sense of time, giving Dr. Hargreaves enough time to escape and make final preparations for the heist. Step 5: The Climax - Jack, struggling with the debilitating effects of the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun, slowly puts the pieces of his shattered memory back together, recalls the plans for the bank robbery, and reports the crime to the authorities. - Simultaneously, Jack tries to find a way to reverse the gun's effects and recover his lost time. Step 6: The Showdown - Jack confronts Dr. Hargreaves again at the bank, this time being more prepared and cautious. A chase ensues, leading to a thrilling and intense battle between Jack and Dr. Hargreaves, both trying to gain the upper hand. Step 7: Resolution - Jack ultimately subdues Dr. Hargreaves and gains access to her research, finding the antidote to the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun's effects. Dr. Hargreaves is apprehended, and the gun's victims finally regain their sense of time. - Having saved the day and learned the importance of valuing time, Jack refocuses on rebuilding his life and career as a more compassionate and efficient private investigator.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fast food restaurant - vegetable market - ireland - produce market - dessert spot I believe the correct choice is \\"fast food restaurant\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Fast food restaurants are indeed the correct choice among the provided options when it comes to businesses that use lots of potatoes. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation as to why this is the case: 1. Fast food restaurant: The primary reason fast food restaurants use a significant number of potatoes is due to the high demand for various potato-based products, such as french fries, hash browns, and potato wedges, among others. These items are staple menu choices in fast food chains globally. French fries, in particular, are one of the most popular fast food items, with McDonald's alone serving approximately 9 million pounds of fries daily worldwide. Besides using large quantities of potatoes, fast food chains contribute to potato farming's development, sustaining the demand for potatoes in the market. 2. Vegetable market: A vegetable market, although being a place where potatoes are sold, does not directly involve using potatoes. Instead, they act as a platform for vendors to sell various vegetables, including potatoes. While this makes them an essential part of the supply chain, they do not consume potatoes themselves. 3. Ireland: Ireland has historically been associated with potatoes due to the Great Famine that occurred in the 19th century. However, the term \\"Ireland\\" does not necessarily refer to a business that uses or consumes potatoes. Although potatoes remain a popular food in Ireland, the country is not a business itself. 4. Produce market: Similar to a vegetable market, a produce market offers an assortment of fresh fruits and vegetables, including potatoes. Despite its role in selling large quantities of potatoes, a produce market does not utilize potatoes in the same way a fast food restaurant does. 5. Dessert spot: Although some dessert spots might use potatoes as a unique and surprising ingredient in certain dishes, the use of potatoes in desserts is not as widespread as their use in fast food restaurants. Potatoes are not a primary ingredient or a staple item in most dessert menus, making this option less relevant than fast food restaurants. In conclusion, fast food restaurants not only consume a large number of potatoes to provide popular menu items but also significantly impact the demand for potatoes in farming and the market.

This is how he did it.","completion":"Yes, a linguist would likely find the sentence \\"This is how he did it.\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. Let's break down the sentence to understand its grammatical structure and components. 1. Sentence Structure: The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order typically found in English sentences. SVO order is when the subject comes first (in this case, \\"This\\"), followed by the verb (\\"is\\"), and then the object (\\"how he did it\\"). This sentence structure allows the reader to easily comprehend the main idea being conveyed. 2. Subject: In this sentence, \\"This\\" acts as a pronoun and serves as the subject. It is referring to a specific, previously mentioned event or activity. Pronouns are used in place of nouns and help to avoid repetition and enhance clarity. 3. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"is,\\" which is a form of the verb \\"to be.\\" The verb \\"to be\\" is often utilized to establish a connection between the subject and the subsequent information provided in the sentence. In this case, it is linking the subject \\"This\\" to the description of how the action was performed (\\"how he did it\\"). 4.

Write an article based on this summary: A government-backed pensioner bond offering competitive rates of up to 4% interest is to be offered for a further three months, George Osborne has said. Article:","completion":"Title: Government-Backed Pensioner Bond with 4% Interest Extended for Three Months Introduction: Chancellor George Osborne announced the extension of the government-backed pensioner bond for an additional three months, providing pensioners with competitive interest rates of up to 4%. This extension aims to benefit thousands of pensioners seeking a safe and lucrative investment opportunity while bolstering the economy. Background of the Pensioner Bond: Pensioner bonds, also known as “65+ Guaranteed Growth Bonds” were first introduced by the UK government in January 2015. These bonds are specifically designed for citizens aged 65 and above, allowing them to purchase fixed-rate savings bonds with relatively higher interest rates than those available in the market. The bonds were initially introduced as a one-year and three-year option, providing attractive returns on investment for a significant portion of the UK's aging population. Reasons for Extending the Bond Offer: Chancellor George Osborne stated that the extension of the pensioner bond for an additional three months was motivated by two primary objectives. The first objective is to ensure that the UK's aging population has access to safe and lucrative investment opportunities that yield higher returns than the average savings account. This not only benefits pensioners but also provides a significant financial cushion for those entering retirement. The second objective behind the extension is to stimulate the economy. By offering higher interest rates than the current market conditions, the government-backed pensioner bond attracts more investors, leading to increased savings and investments. This simultaneously supports the growth of the economy and the financial stability of pensioners during their retirement years. Features of the Government-backed Pensioner Bond: The major features of the government-backed pensioner bond include: 1. Eligibility: Pensioner bonds are exclusive to individuals aged 65 and above. This age-specific investment opportunity enables older individuals to secure a lucrative investment plan designed to cater to their unique financial requirements. 2. Interest Rates: The major attraction of the pensioner bond is its competitive interest rates, which offer up to 4% returns on investments. Considering the current economic climate, these interest rates are considerably higher than what traditional savings accounts and investment products offer. 3. Investment Tenure: Pensioner bonds are offered as a one-year and three-year investment option. Investors have the flexibility to choose their preferred investment tenure and plan their finances accordingly. 4. Security: Pensioner bonds are backed by the UK government, making them an extremely secure investment option. This is particularly important for pensioners seeking financial stability during their retirement years and looking for safe avenues to invest their hard-earned savings. Benefits of the Bond for Pensioners: The pensioner bond's primary benefit is its attractive interest rates, which offer higher returns than most savings accounts and investment opportunities in the market. This enables pensioners to maximize their financial security by investing in a risk-free, high-yield investment instrument. Additionally, pensioner bonds can help mitigate the impact of inflation as they offer higher returns than traditional savings accounts. For retirees dependent on a fixed income, investing in bonds could provide them with supplementary income that outpaces price increases and maintains their purchasing power. Conclusion: The extension of the government-backed pensioner bond signifies the government's commitment to prioritizing the financial stability of its aging population. As the UK witnesses an increasing number of individuals entering their retirement years, the provision of secure and lucrative investment opportunities like the pensioner bond can play a pivotal role in ensuring their financial security, well-being, and continued contribution to the growth and prosperity of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Results During 3 500 004 person years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median 7.2 years), a total of 11 820 men and 8404 women died. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Spicy food consumption showed highly consistent inverse associations with total mortality among both men and women after adjustment for other known or potential risk factors. In the whole cohort, compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96), 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92), and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality. The inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was stronger in those who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases. The beneficial effects of spices and their bioactive ingredients such as capsaicin have long been documented in experimental or small sized population studies. For example, an ecological study showed that populations with a higher consumption of spices have a lower incidence of cancer. 4 The ingestion of red pepper was found to decrease appetite and energy intake in people of Asian origin and white people and might reduce the risk of overweight and obesity. 5 6 In addition, the bioactive agents in spices have also shown beneficial roles in obesity, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal conditions, various cancers, neurogenic bladder, and dermatological conditions. 7 8 9 Moreover, spices exhibit antibacterial activity and affect gut microbiota populations, which in humans have been recently related to risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. 10 11 12 These data collectively suggest that spices may have a profound influence on morbidities and mortality in humans; however, the evidence relating daily consumption of spicy foods and total and disease specific mortality from population studies is lacking. Spices have been an integral part of culinary cultures around the world and have a long history of use for flavoring, coloring, and preserving food, as well as for medicinal purposes. The increased use of spices as flavorings in foods is a major trend worldwide. 1 2 In China, chilli pepper is among the most popular spicy foods consumed nationwide. 3 Subgroup analyses were conducted separately among participants who did and did not report fresh chilli pepper as one of their commonly used spices. We compared both with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. We also examined the associations of spicy food consumption with total mortality among prespecified baseline subgroups based on age (<50, 50 to 59, or ≥60), smoking status (regular smoker, or not), alcohol consumption (regular drinker, or not), level of physical activity (categorized using tertile cut-offs), and body mass index (<24.0, 24.0 to 27.9, or ≥28.0). The tests for interaction were performed by means of likelihood ratio tests, which involved comparing models with and without cross product terms between the baseline stratifying variable and spicy food consumption as an ordinal variable. To examine the robustness of our findings, we also conducted several sensitivity analyses: additionally adjusting for occupation and household income; additionally adjusting for histories of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, and gallstone or cholecystitis; adjusting for a 13 level detailed smoking variable, which incorporated the information on amount of smoking in regular smokers and the time since quitting in former smokers, instead of a four level smoking variable; excluding participants dying during the first two years of follow-up; excluding participants who had diabetes at baseline; excluding participants who reported exclusive use of other spices instead of any types of chilli; stratifying analyses by rural or urban residence; and stratifying analyses by follow-up duration (<3 or ≥3 years). Multivariate models were adjusted for established and potential risk factors for death: age (continuous, serving as the underlying timescale); sex (male or female); level of education (no formal school, primary school, middle school, high school, college, or university or higher); marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, or never married); alcohol consumption (non-drinker, occasional drinker, former drinker, or regular drinker); smoking status (never smoker, occasional smoker, former smoker, or regular smoker); physical activity in MET hours a day (continuous); body mass index (continuous); intake frequencies of red meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables (daily, 4-6 days/wk, 1-3 days/wk, monthly, or rarely or never); prevalent hypertension and diabetes at baseline (presence or absence); menopausal status (for women only, premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal); and status of family history of cancer, heart attack, stroke, or diabetes (presence or absence). We adjusted for the family history variables only in the corresponding analysis of cause specific mortality. We measured person years from baseline (2004–08) until the date of death, loss to follow-up, or 31 December 2013, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of mortality for spicy food consumption, with age as the underlying time scale. We accounted for the group specific effect of 10 survey sites on the hazard function by stratifying on the survey site variable in the Cox model. Trained staff blinded to baseline information classified any deaths occurring among participants by using ICD-10 codes (international classification of diseases, 10th revision). The deaths were grouped into seven categories: cancer (C00-C97), ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25), cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69), diabetes mellitus (E10-E14), diseases of the respiratory system (J00-J99), infections (A00-B99), and all other causes. Losses to follow-up in this study refer to participants whose permanent registered residence was no longer in the study area, who could not be contacted after at least three reasonable efforts within one year, or who could be contacted but their new residence was out of the jurisdiction of the regional coordinating center. We ascertained vital status by means of linkage with local disease surveillance points system death registries 15 and residential records. To minimize the under-reporting of deaths and to identify participants who had moved permanently out of the study areas, we also carried out separate active follow-up annually by reviewing residential records, visiting local communities, or directly contacting participants. 14 The causes of death were sought chiefly from official death certificates that were supplemented, if necessary, by a review of the medical records or undertaking a verbal autopsy using a validated instrument for those with an ill defined or unknown cause of death reported. The electronic linkage to the national health insurance claim databases started in 2011, which has become an important means of follow-up and helped to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and phenotyping of reported conditions, outcome adjudication, and further data collection. Linkage to local health insurance databases has been achieved for about 95% of the participants in 2013. Participants from both urban and rural areas had similar proportions of successful linkage to health insurance databases. Linkage to local health insurance database was renewed annually. Participants who failed to be linked to local health insurance database were actively followed annually by staff to ascertain their status, including hospital admission, death, and moving out of the study area. Linkage to a local health insurance database has become an important supplementary way of ascertaining deaths. At baseline, trained staff measured body weight, height, and blood pressure using calibrated instruments. Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg)/(height (m) 2 . A stepwise on-site testing of plasma glucose level was undertaken using the SureStep Plus meter (LifeScan; Milpitas, CA). Prevalent hypertension was defined as a measured systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, a measured diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, self reported diagnosis of hypertension, or self reported use of antihypertensive drugs at baseline. Prevalent diabetes was defined as a measured fasting blood glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L or more, a measured random blood glucose concentration of 11.1 mmol/L or more, or self reported diagnosis of diabetes. We obtained covariates from the baseline questionnaire, including sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, education, occupation, household income, and marital status), lifestyle behaviors (alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, physical activity, and intakes of red meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables), personal health and medical history (hypertension, diabetes, chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, gallstones or cholecystitis, and menopausal status for women only), and information on family members, including biological parents and siblings who had had cancer, heart attack, stroke, or diabetes. The daily level of physical activity was calculated by multiplying the metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) value for a particular type of physical activity by hours spent on that activity per day and summing the MET hours for all activities. Habitual dietary intake in the past year was assessed by a qualitative food frequency questionnaire. A participant was considered as having a family history of a particular disease if they reported at least one first degree relative with the disease. After completion of the baseline survey in July 2008, about 5% randomly chosen surviving participants in 10 survey sites were resurveyed during August and October of 2008. 14 To test the reproducibility of the frequency of spicy food consumption, we included 1300 participants who completed the same questionnaire twice at an interval of less than 1.5 years (median 1.4 years). Spearman’s coefficient for the correlation between the two questionnaires was 0.71, indicating that spicy food consumption was reported consistently. In the baseline questionnaire we asked the participants “During the past month, about how often did you eat hot spicy foods?”: never or almost never, only occasionally, 1 or 2 days a week, 3 to 5 days a week, or 6 or 7 days a week. The participants who selected the last three categories were further asked “When you eat spicy foods, what are the main sources of spices usually used?” (multiple choices allowed fresh chilli pepper, dried chilli pepper, chilli sauce, chilli oil, and other or don’t know). The China Kadoorie Biobank is a prospective cohort study of over 0.5 million adults from 10 geographically diverse areas across China; participants were enrolled between 2004 and 2008 and have been followed up ever since for morbidities and mortality. Further details of the China Kadoorie Biobank study have been described elsewhere. 13 14 Briefly, a total of 512 891 adults aged 30-79 years had valid baseline data—that is, completed questionnaire, physical measurements, and a written informed consent form. Fig 2 Subgroup analysis of associations between consumption of spicy foods ≥6 days a week and total mortality according to potential baseline risk factors. Hazard ratios for total mortality are for comparison of men and women who ate spicy foods ≥6 days a week with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. Risk estimates for other categories of spicy food consumption are shown in appendix table 2. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals We also analyzed the associations between spicy food consumption and total mortality according to other potential baseline risk factors for death; the inverse associations between spicy food consumption and total mortality were generally similar across subgroups stratified according to age, smoking status, level of physical activity, and body mass index (all P values for interaction >0.05) (fig 2 ⇓ and appendix table 2). Significant differences across stratums were observed for alcohol consumption, with a stronger inverse association among participants who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Fig 1 Subgroup analysis of associations between consumption of spicy foods ≥6 days a week and total and cause specific mortality according to consumption of fresh chilli pepper. Hazard ratios for death from all causes and from specific causes are for comparison of men and women who ate spicy foods ≥6 days a week with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. Appendix table 1 shows the risk estimates for other categories of spicy food consumption. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals We further performed stratified analyses according to whether the participants reported using fresh chilli pepper as their predominant spice. We found that the inverse associations of daily spicy food consumption with death due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and diabetes seemed stronger in the fresh chilli group than in the non-fresh chilli group in the whole cohort of women and men, and the results were statistically significant in the fresh chilli group (fig 1 ⇓ and appendix table 1). In the sensitivity analyses, the associations of spicy food consumption with total and cause specific mortality did not change appreciably with additional adjustment for occupation and household income; or additional adjustment for histories of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, and gallstone or cholecystitis; or adjustment for a 13 level detailed smoking variable instead of a four level smoking variable; or excluding participants dying during the first two years of follow-up; or excluding participants with prevalent diabetes at baseline; or excluding participants with exclusive use of other spices instead of any types of chilli (data not shown). The associations of spicy food consumption with total and cause specific mortality were consistently observed in participants from both rural and urban areas and for different follow-up durations (<3 or ≥3 years). After multivariate adjustment, spicy food consumption was inversely associated with the risks of death due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases in the whole cohort (table 2). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in the associations between spicy food consumption and cause specific mortality by sex (all P>0.05). Nevertheless, the associations seemed to be less evident in men than in women (table 3). In addition, more frequent consumption of spicy foods in women was also significantly associated with a reduced risk of death due to infections. During a median follow-up of 7.2 years (interquartile range 1.84 years; total person years 3 500 004), we documented 11 820 deaths among men and 8404 deaths among women. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week and 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Age adjusted and multivariate adjusted analyses showed a statistically significant inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality. In the whole cohort, compared with participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96) for those who ate spicy foods 1 or 2 days a week, 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92) for 3 to 5 days a week, and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for 6 or 7 days a week (table 2 ⇓ ). Compared with participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for total mortality among men, compared with men who ate spicy foods less than once a week, were 0.90 (0.83 to 0.98) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2 days a week, 0.90 (0.83 to 0.99) for 3 to 5 days, and 0.90 (0.85 to 0.96) for 6 or 7 days a week; the respective hazard ratios among women were 0.88 (0.79 to 0.98), 0.78 (0.69 to 0.88), and 0.81 (0.75 to 0.87) (table 3 ⇓ ). There was no heterogeneity between men and women in any of the associations (P=0.723). Table 1 ⇓ presents the age and site adjusted baseline characteristics of the participants according to the categories of spicy food consumption. Compared with participants who consumed spicy foods less frequently (3 to 5 days a week or less), those who consumed spicy foods almost every day were more likely to be rural residents, more likely to smoke tobacco and consume alcohol, and more frequently to consume red meat, vegetables, and fruits. Fresh and dried chilli peppers were the most commonly used types of spices in those who reported consuming spicy foods weekly (table 1). Discussion In this large prospective study, we observed an inverse association between consumption of spicy foods and total mortality, after adjusting for potential confounders. Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods almost every day had a 14% lower risk of death. Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases. The associations were consistent in men and women. Strengths and limitations of this study The strengths of this study include a large sample size, a prospective cohort design, and careful control for established and potential risk factors for death. This study does have a few limitations. Consumption of spicy foods may be correlated with other dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors. For example, in Chinese cuisine the cooking of chilli pepper and the production of chilli sauce and oil usually requires more oil, and intake of pungent foods may be accompanied by an increased intake of carbohydrate-rich foods such as rice to relieve the burning sensation. However, the lack of detailed dietary information in this study limited our ability to comprehensively adjust for total energy intake and other specific dietary factors. In addition, spicy food consumption may be correlated with socioeconomic status,16 which we partly controlled for in our analyses. Residual confounding by other unmeasured or unknown biological and social factors was still possible, although we carefully adjusted for several established and potential risk factors for death. However, residual confounding by the aforementioned or other confounding factors might have attenuated the inverse associations between spicy food consumption and mortality toward the null. Although chilli pepper was the most commonly used spice in our population, the use of other types of spices usually increases as the use of chilli pepper increases. Thus the health benefits of these spices apart from chilli pepper may also contribute to the observed inverse associations. Reverse causality is another possible explanation for our findings because people with chronic disease might abstain from spicy foods. However, we excluded participants who had cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline. Moreover, the results remained largely unchanged when we excluded participants dying during the first two years of follow-up from analyses or additionally adjusted for several major digestive system diseases that might deter people from consuming spicy foods. Although we employed multiple ways to maximize death ascertainment of participants, under-reporting of deaths might have occurred. However, the proportion of participants under-reported on death status would not depend on the levels of spicy food consumption. Considering that specificity of outcome detection is nearly perfect and sensitivity is lower than 100% in both exposure groups, outcome misclassification would produce little bias in estimating hazard ratio.17 The consumption of spicy foods was self reported; therefore, some measurement error is inevitable. The questionnaire on spicy food consumption used in our study has not yet been validated directly; however, previous studies have shown that using similar food frequency questionnaires could produce valid estimates of food consumption in a Chinese population.18 In addition, in a prospective study design, measurement errors may be non-differential and the measure of association is more likely to be biased toward the null. The consumption of spicy foods reported for a short period may not necessarily reflect the long term patterns of consumption. However, repeated collections of dietary information averaged 1.4 years in our cohort and have shown that the reported intakes of dietary factors including spicy foods were highly consistent over time. In addition, information was not available on how spicy foods were prepared and cooked. Such information would have enabled us to perform further analyses on the relation between spicy food consumption and mortality more extensively. Comparison with other studies and potential mechanism Our study is the first to analyze the association between daily consumption of spicy foods and mortality in a prospective cohort. Our findings are in line with previous evidence showing potential protective effects of spicy foods on human health. Capsaicin is the main active component of chilli pepper. The beneﬁcial roles of capsaicin have been extensively reported in relation to anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antihypertensive effects, and in improving glucose homeostasis, largely in experimental or small sized population studies.7 8 9 Additionally, the antimicrobial function of spices, including chilli pepper, has long been recognized,3 19 and such a property may have an important effect on the gut microbiota in humans. In recent years, rapidly emerging evidence has implicated gut microbiota as a novel and important metabolic factor that affects the health of the host,20 and several studies in humans have related abundance, composition, and metabolites of gut microbiota to risk of obesity,21 22 23 diabetes,12 24 liver cirrhosis,11 and cardiovascular disease.10 25 However, how spicy foods and their bioactive ingredients may affect the composition and activity of gut microbiota has yet to be further investigated. In addition, our study suggested a threshold of around 1 or 2 days a week of spicy food consumption, beyond which the risk for mortality did not decrease further. Possible mechanisms might involve the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of bioactive ingredients and nutrients of spicy foods26; but further studies are needed to verify our findings. Our study indicated that spicy food consumption was particularly related to the reduced risk of mortality due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases. Several previous epidemiological studies have suggested protective effects of capsaicin consumption on stomach or gallbladder cancer,7 9 27 although such effects were not consistently observed. The cardiovascular system is rich in capsaicin sensitive sensory nerves, which have an extensive role in regulating cardiovascular function.28 The antioxidant and antiplatelet properties of capsaicin and the important role of capsaicin in regulating energy metabolism may also contribute to its beneﬁcial effects on the cardiovascular system.7 9 28 29 30 31 32 Less well known are the possible mechanisms underlying the potentially beneficial effect of spicy foods on respiratory diseases. However, the anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive effects of spicy foods would generally protect all these specific systems. Because the number of deaths from infections was relatively small, our study might not have had enough statistical power to rule out a possible relation between spicy food consumption and infections specific mortality. Compared with non-fresh spicy foods such as dried chilli pepper, chilli sauce, or chilli oil, fresh chilli pepper is richer in bioactive ingredients, including capsaicin, vitamin C, and other nutrients such as vitamin A, K, and B6, and potassium. In our stratified analyses we found that the inverse associations of spicy food consumption with certain cause specific deaths (cancer, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes) seemed to be stronger in those who consumed fresh chilli pepper than those who consumed non-fresh spicy foods. These data suggest that some of the bioactive ingredients are likely to be effective in driving the observed associations. Interestingly, a statistically significant inverse association between the daily consumption of spicy foods and diabetes, which was not observed in the whole cohort, was found in the subgroup that consumed fresh chilli pepper. This was consistent with previous evidence showing that dietary capsaicin may provide beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis.33 However, it remains unclear whether other nutrients abundant in fresh chilli pepper also have roles in lowering the risk of mortality. Intriguingly, we found that the inverse association was stronger in those who did not than did drink alcohol. Alcohol consumption has been related to an increased risk of mortality in some but not all previous studies.34 35 36 Even though moderate alcohol consumption has been related to a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, moderately high alcohol consumption may increase energy intake37 and has been associated with increased mortality.38 In addition, alcohol intake also affects the metabolism of gut microbiota.39 40 Even though the precise mechanism remains unclear, the interaction between spicy foods and alcohol intake is biologically possible. We acknowledge that disease status might affect both alcohol and spicy food intakes, and we excluded participants with chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline from our analyses. Further investigations are warranted to validate our findings and explore the mechanisms. ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health People who love chili peppers might be eating their way to a longer life, according to a new study published in The BMJ. “We know something about the beneficial effects of spicy foods basically from animal studies and very small-sized human studies,” says study author Lu Qi, associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. Some of those preliminary studies have found that spicy food and their active components—like capsaicin, the compound found in chili peppers—might lower inflammation, improve metabolic status and have a positive effect on gut bacteria and weight, he says. But human evidence remains scant. So Qi and a team of researchers looked at questionnaire data from about half a million adults all across China who participated in the China Kadoorie Biobank study between 2004-2008. Each person in the study reported their health status, alcohol consumption, spicy food consumption, main source of chili intake (fresh or dried, in a sauce or in an oil) as well as meat and vegetable consumption. The researchers followed up with them about seven years later. Compared to people who ate spicy foods less than once a week, people who ate them just once or twice a week had a 10% reduced risk of death. Bumping up the spice consumption didn’t make much of a difference; those who ate spicy food 3-7 days a week were at 14% reduced risk of death compared to the most spice-averse group. Eating chili-rich spicy foods was also linked to a lower risk of death from certain diseases, including cancer, ischemic heart diseases and respiratory diseases, they found. Further analysis revealed that fresh chili had a stronger protective effect against death from those diseases. More research is needed to make any causal case for the protective effects of chili—this does not prove that the spicy foods were the reason for the health outcomes—but Qi finds this observational research valuable. “It appears that increasing your intake moderately, just to 1-2 or 3-5 times a week, shows very similar protective effect,” he says. “Just increase moderately. That’s maybe enough.” MORE: 3 Reasons You Should Eat More Spicy Food |||||","completion":"A study published in The BMJ has found that frequent consumption of spicy foods, especially fresh chili, has been linked to a lower risk of death.

I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu. I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...? Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss. I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad. When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve. Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me. So long story short. Try it for the experience but don't expect much cause you know, for the price and all.... ( last part was sarcasm if you didn't catch it )","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as predominantly negative, with a touch of disappointment and frustration. The reviewer starts by mentioning their history with Teharu and how they initially enjoyed the place but have now reached a point where they are considering not returning. The main focus of their dissatisfaction is the food quality and variety. The reviewer expresses concerns about their favorite rolls being consistently disappointing in recent visits, specifically mentioning issues with temperature, spiciness, and an unpleasant smell in the Bake Scallop roll. The review also addresses the lack of new rolls and their dissatisfaction with the conveyor belt sushi system, as they observe that the sushi on the belt appears old and not replenished frequently. The reviewer questions the price-quality relationship, indicating that while the price is low, they believe there should be limits to the compromises made in terms of food quality. They suggest that the \\"for the price it's not bad\\" mentality allows restaurants like this one to continue offering subpar dining experiences. Lastly, the reviewer briefly mentions poor service from the waitstaff at the restaurant but chooses not to elaborate on it, implying that it adds to the overall negative sentiments about the place. Their closing statement is a sarcastic recommendation to try the restaurant for the experience, but not to expect much due to the price."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She is transferred to the homicide division and promoted to the rank of inspector. Her deceased father's former partner, John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson), serves as her proud mentor. Shepard finds that she might once again have to prove herself in a department that takes no prisoners. When one of her former one-night stands is murdered, Shepard and her new partner, Mike Delmarco (Andy GarcÃ­a), are assigned to the case. Shepard, who has a drinking problem, soon falls under suspicion. Three more murders follow, each victim having had a relationship with her. Shepard begins to experience a mental breakdown, blacking out for increasingly long periods of time. Her father, a police patrolman, had gone on a killing spree back in the 1970s and then murdered her mother. She begins to fear that she has the same violent tendencies and that she has been committing murder in her disoriented state. Shepard finds out that Mills is the killer. He killed all of her lovers, as well as her parents, because he considered it his mission to prevent her growing up to be a dissolute woman like her mother. As her father's partner, Mills had felt the responsibility to inform him that his wife was a nymphomaniac, which drove him insane. As he had an illicit affair with Shepard's mother, Mills felt the need to kill her lovers. Also ashamed that he destroyed his partner's marriage and drove him insane, Mills decided to put him out of his misery by killing him. Shepard secretly transmits Mills' confession on a mobile phone, allowing her old partner to track them down.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of Albrecht the Elder's son?, using the article: Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"Considering the information provided in the article, the son of Albrecht the Elder is not explicitly named. However, we can deduce that their son is Albrecht Dürer, a famous painter, as he completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut and would soon travel as a journeyman painter to Nuremberg, which are known biographical details of Albrecht Dürer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Karen Horney was born Karen Danielsen on 16 September 1885 in Blankenese, Germany, near Hamburg. Her father, Berndt Wackels Danielsen (1836-1910), was Norwegian but had German citizenship. He was a ship's captain in the merchant marine, and a Protestant traditionalist (his children nicknamed him \\"the Bible-thrower\\", as he did indeed throw Bibles). Her mother, Clotilde, nee van Ronzelen (1853-1911), known as \\"Sonni\\", was also Protestant, of Dutch origin. Horney, together with fellow psychoanalyst Alfred Adler, formed the Neo-Freudian discipline. While Horney acknowledged and agreed with Freud on many issues, she was also critical of him on several key beliefs. Like many who held opposing views with Freud, Horney felt that sex and aggression were not the primary constituents for determining personality. Horney, along with Adler, believed there were greater influences on personality through social occurrences during childhood, rather than just repressed sexual passions. The two focused more on how the conscious mind plays a role in human personality, not just subconscious repression. Freud's notion of \\"penis envy\\" was particularly subject to criticism, as well. She thought Freud had merely stumbled upon women's jealousy of men's generic power in the world. Horney accepted that penis envy might occur occasionally in neurotic women, but stated that \\"womb envy\\" occurs just as much in men: Horney felt that men were envious of a woman's ability to bear children. The degree to which men are driven to success may be merely a substitute for the fact that they cannot carry, nurture and bear children. Horney also thought that men were envious of women because they fulfill their position in society by simply \\"being\\", whereas men achieve their manhood according to their ability to provide and succeed. Horney was bewildered by psychiatrists' tendency to place so much emphasis on the male sexual organ. Horney also reworked the Freudian Oedipal complex of the sexual elements, claiming that the clinging to one parent and jealousy of the other was simply the result of anxiety, caused by a disturbance in the parent-child relationship. Despite these variances with the prevalent Freudian view, Horney strove to reformulate Freudian thought, presenting a holistic, humanistic view of the individual psyche which placed much emphasis on cultural and social differences worldwide.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did she believe this?","completion":"Karen Horney believed that influences on personality came more from social occurrences during childhood and conscious mind, rather than just repressed sexual passions. She thought that focusing only on sex and aggression was not enough to explain human personality. Horney and Adler paid more attention to how people's thoughts and experiences while growing up affected their personalities. They believed that understanding individuals required considering their culture and social differences as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The 'Friendship 7' Mercury capsule is a significant artifact in the history of spaceflight as it is intimately connected with one of the critical milestones in the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union - the first human orbital flight by an American. John Glenn's mission on board the Friendship 7 placed the United States into an international competition with the Soviet Union, only a few months after Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin's historic orbital flight. This flight was part of Project Mercury, the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963. With regards to the capsule itself, the Friendship 7 is a small, cone-shaped spacecraft with a cylindrical section at the rear. It measures just over 9 feet in height and has a maximum diameter of 6.5 feet. The nose cone containing the parachute system is housed in the cylindrical part of the spacecraft, and the astronaut sat in the cone-shaped section. The spacecraft had very limited room, only enough for a single astronaut. The astronaut had to sit with his legs drawn up, in a sort of half-reclining position. The control panel, located right in front of the astronaut, included the main instrument panel, with all sorts of dials, gauges, warning lights, and switches. Among the innovative features of the spacecraft was its heat shield made of material that would burn away and thus dissipate reentry heat (a principle named \\"ablative cooling\\"). The spacecraft was also designed to remain in one attitude without any adjustments by the astronaut. The Friendship 7 flight lasted just under five hours and orbited the Earth three times, reaching a maximum altitude of approximately 162 miles and an orbital velocity of 17,500 miles per hour. Today, the 'Friendship 7' Mercury capsule is a prized exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., serving as a poignant reminder of the early era of human spaceflight and its milestone achievements. It stands as a testament to American innovation and courage in the face of the unknown, representing a significant chapter in the history of human exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The New York Public Library, in the heart of the city at 42nd Street and 5th Avenue, may have to close its doors. The library is one of New York's most beautiful and valuable buildings. Even though it is in the busiest part of the city, it has grass and trees around it, and benches for people to sit on. Even more unusual in crowded New York, its rooms are very large. The roof of the Main Reading Room is 51 feet high. Here, a reader can sit and work in comfort. The library has over thirty million books and paintings. It owns one of the first copies of a Shakespeare's play, a Bible printed in the 15th century, and a letter written by Columbus in which he tells of finding the new world. Every New Yorker can visit the library and use its riches -- free. But the cost of running the library has risen sharply in recent years, and the library has not enough money to continue its work. In the past, it was open every day. Now it is closed on Saturdays and Sundays and every evening to save money. The library is trying to raise more money to meet its increasing cost. Well-known writers and artists are trying to help. So are the universities, whose students use the library, and the government of New York City. But the problem remains serious.

A: The answer is:","completion":"Science is a process of knowing about the natural universe through two main actions: Observation and Experimentation. 1. Observation: This is the process of gathering information about natural phenomena around us. It involves using our senses or specialized tools and instruments to monitor and study objects, events, or processes in nature. Observations can be qualitative, where we describe characteristics or properties, or quantitative, where we measure specific quantities or values. Systematic observations form the basis for forming hypotheses, which are testable explanations for the observed phenomena. 2. Experimentation: This is the systematic testing of hypotheses by manipulating variables under controlled conditions. In an experiment, the researcher typically designs a controlled environment where one or more independent variables are manipulated to observe the effects on a dependent variable. The researcher then records the data, which is analyzed and used to draw conclusions. This helps in verifying, refuting, or refining the hypothesis, ultimately contributing to the development of scientific theories. These two actions work together in an iterative process, as new observations may lead to new hypotheses and experiments, while experiments may prompt further observations. This systematic approach, known as the scientific method, allows scientists to gain an ever-evolving understanding of the natural universe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it. I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems.

He was born and educated in Scotland but moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in \\"The Little White Bird\\"), then to write \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\", a \\"fairy play\\" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland. - Neverland is a fictional location featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them. It is an imaginary faraway place, where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and other mythical creatures and beings live. Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism. It was first introduced as \\"the Never Never Land\\" in the theatre play \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\" by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, first staged in 1904. - Immortality is eternal life, the ability to live forever. At least one species has potential biological immortality: \\"Turritopsis dohrnii\\". - Escapism is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of daily life. It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persisting feelings of depression or general sadness. - The Little White Bird is a British novel by J. M. Barrie, ranging in tone from fantasy and whimsy to social comedy with dark, aggressive undertones. It was published in November 1902, by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK and Scribner's in the US, although the latter had released it serially in the monthly \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" from August to November. The book attained prominence and longevity thanks to several chapters written in a softer tone than the rest of the book, which introduced the character and mythology of Peter Pan. In 1906, those chapters were published separately as a children's book, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. - Childhood is the age span ranging from birth to adolescence. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, childhood consists of two stages: preoperational stage and concrete operational stage. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of toddlerhood (learning to walk), early childhood (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation. - A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans. - The works of J. M. Barrie about Peter Pan feature many memorable characters . The numerous adaptations and sequels to those stories feature many of the same characters , and introduce new ones . Most of these strive for continuity with Barrie 's work , developing a fairly consistent cast of characters living in Neverland and the real - world settings of Barrie 's stories . - Wendy is a given name generally given to females in English-speaking countries. - Peter Pan is a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include a 1953 animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action film, a TV series and many other works. - Kensington Gardens, once the private gardens of Kensington Palace, are among the Royal Parks of London. They gardens are shared by the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and sit immediately to the west of Hyde Park, in western central London. The gardens cover an area of 270 acres. The open spaces of Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James's Park together form an almost continuous \\"green lung\\" in the heart of London. Kensington Gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. - The Davies boys (the family only used the double surname Llewelyn Davies in formal contexts) were the sons of Arthur (18631907) and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (18661910), the daughter of the French-born cartoonist and writer George du Maurier and sister of actor Gerald du Maurier. The boys were the first cousins of Gerald's daughter, the author Daphne du Maurier. They were the inspiration for J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, in which several of the characters were named after them. - Tinker Bell (Tink for short), is a fictional character from J. M. Barrie's 1904 play \\"Peter Pan\\" and its 1911 novelization \\"Peter and Wendy\\". She has appeared in multiple film and television adaptations of the Peter Pan stories, in particular the 1953 animated Walt Disney picture \\"Peter Pan\\". She also appears in the official sequel \\"Peter Pan in Scarlet\\" by Geraldine McCaughrean commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital as well as the \\"Peter and the Starcatchers\\" book series by Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Thuringia: The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km² wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): Dün, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffhäuser, Hohe Schrecke, Schmücke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, Hörselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner Höhe and Heilinger Höhen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Großer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rhön Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Weiße Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of Weiße Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Pleiße river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.

As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV...

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose No bats in the area happens, how will it affect the inner core is smaller. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To examine the effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the process, we need to consider each step and determine if the presence or absence of bats in the area can influence or be connected to any of them. Step 1: A red giant burns mass Justification: Bats are not involved in the process of a red giant burning mass. The burning process occurs due to nuclear fusion within the star and is not influenced by external elements like the presence or absence of bats. Step 2: This mass creates high core temperatures Justification: Again, the creation of high core temperatures is not related to the presence or absence of bats. High core temperatures are a result of the nuclear fusion process within the star. Step 3: The mass decreases Justification: The decrease in mass is a natural result of the nuclear fusion process and is not influenced by the presence or absence of bats in the area. Step 4: The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center Justification: The inability to fuse carbon and oxygen is due to the internal processes within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 5: The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers Justification: The lack of gravity to hold the outside layers is an internal issue within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 6: The layers break away Justification: The layers breaking away is a result of the previous steps and the internal processes within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 7: Only the inner core remains Justification: The remaining inner core is again a result of the internal processes within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 8: This inner core is known as a white dwarf Justification: The naming and classification of the white dwarf are related to the properties and characteristics of the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the perturbation hypothesis of \\"no bats in the area\\" does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of a red giant transforming into a white dwarf. The processes involved in this transformation are related to the internal workings of the star and are not influenced by external factors such as the presence or absence of bats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is it bad when I wake up, walk to the hallway and feel like falling over and my eyes get blurry? Feeling like you're falling over and experiencing blurry vision upon waking up and walking to the hallway may be indicative of a health concern that requires attention. There are several potential causes for these symptoms, and it is essential to understand the possible reasons to address them effectively. Potential causes: a. Dehydration: Your body may be dehydrated after a long sleep, resulting in dizziness and blurry vision. Make sure to drink enough water to keep your body adequately hydrated. b. Low Blood Pressure: Sudden changes in position, such as getting up from lying down, may lead to a temporary drop in blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension. This causes dizziness and imbalance in some individuals. c. Low Blood Sugar: Low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia, can also produce dizziness, confusion, and blurry vision upon waking up. d. Sleep Apnea: This sleep disorder causes your breathing to stop and start during sleep. The interrupted oxygen supply can cause dizziness and other symptoms. e. Inner Ear Problems: Conditions such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or Meniere's disease can cause dizziness and balance issues upon waking up. Consulting a healthcare professional is recommended to diagnose and address the specific cause of these symptoms. 2. What can I do to not feel depressed and like a stagnant human being when and in the hours after I wake up? To combat feelings of depression and stagnation in the morning, consider implementing the following strategies: a. Establish a regular sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day helps regulate your internal clock, leading to improved mood and energy levels. b. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins that can improve mood and alleviate depression. Incorporate physical activity into your morning routine, such as stretching, walking, or light exercise. c. Practice mindfulness: Morning meditation, deep breathing, or journaling can help you focus on positive thoughts and start your day with a clearer and more balanced state of mind. d. Plan your day: Create a daily to-do list or set goals for the day to establish structure, provide a sense of accomplishment, and combat feelings of stagnation. e. Eat a nutritious breakfast: An adequate and balanced meal helps ensure stable blood sugar levels, reducing feelings of fatigue and lightheadedness. f. Socialize: Connect with friends, family, or coworkers in the morning to foster a sense of community and belonging, which can alleviate depression. g. Seek professional help: If feelings of depression persist, consider speaking with a mental health professional for support and guidance. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? (1). No, the questions do not have the same meaning. The first question addresses physical symptoms (dizziness and blurry vision) experienced upon waking up, while the second question focuses on emotional well-being (depression and stagnation) in the morning. Although both questions pertain to the individual's experience during and shortly after waking up, they address different aspects of the individual's health - one being physical and the other being emotional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: who killed scarface in the end of the movie?","completion":"In the 1983 crime drama film \\"Scarface,\\" directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, the character Tony Montana, also known as Scarface, is played by Al Pacino. The movie, a violent and thrilling exploration of the Miami drug trade in the 1980s, follows Montana's rise from a Cuban refugee to the ruthless leader of a powerful drug empire. Towards the end of the movie, Tony Montana's world begins to crumble due to his increasing paranoia, drug addiction, and mounting tensions with the Colombian drug lord Alejandro Sosa and his associates. Sosa becomes furious with Montana for failing to cooperate in the assassination of a journalist who was planning to expose Sosa's criminal activities. Montana's refusal to go through with the assassination, primarily because the journalist's wife and children would also be killed, leads Sosa to take drastic measures against him. In the climactic and final scene, Montana is betrayed by his man, Alberto \\"The Shadow\\" (played by Mark Margolis). Sosa, vowing to exact revenge on Montana, sends a squad of heavily-armed hitmen to infiltrate and attack Montana's mansion. As the invaders make their way through the mansion, they manage to kill many of Montana's loyal bodyguards and soldiers. Tony Montana, heavily intoxicated by cocaine and fueled by rage, confronts the assailants with a grenade launcher-equipped M16 assault rifle. He engages in a brutal and chaotic firefight, taking down numerous hitmen and sustaining multiple gunshot wounds in the process. However, Montana's eventual demise comes at the hands of \\"The Skull\\" (played by Geno Silva), one of Sosa's most trusted and deadly assassins. As Montana is occupied in the firefight and shouting defiantly at the remaining attackers, The Skull sneaks up behind him. Taking advantage of Montana's distraction, The Skull fires a single shot from his shotgun at point-blank range into Montana's back, dealing a lethal blow and causing Montana to fall into the mansion's decorative fountain below. Thus, it is \\"The Skull,\\" the henchman of Alejandro Sosa, who is ultimately responsible for the death of Tony Montana, better known as Scarface, at the end of the movie.

Honolulu (CNN) -- Hawaii has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country. As part of a new CNN project called Change the List, I'm trying to create a conversation that could change that. But I'll need your help to make it work. Here's what you can do: In the gallery at the top of this story you'll find information about six nonvoters in Hawaii. They have some interesting reasons for not voting. One is a high school student who has specific political interests but says he feels too young and uninformed to participate in something as serious as voting. Another doesn't want Hawaii to be part of the","completion":"United States anymore and believes that voting would reinforce that connection. Learn about their stories and reasons for not voting, and then think about ways to address their concerns or convince them to participate in the voting process. Here's a step-by-step plan to encourage these nonvoters to vote: Step 1: Research and gather information - First, read the stories and understand the individual reasons why each of the six nonvoters in Hawaii refrains from voting in elections. Step 2: Identify common concerns and misconceptions - Note down and analyze common concerns or misconceptions that these nonvoters share. This might include feeling uninformed, feeling too young, or having specific political views that make voting seem irrelevant to them. Step 3: Develop individualized strategies - For each nonvoter, brainstorm an individualized approach to create a conversation that would address their concerns and change their perspective. For example: - For the high school student, provide resources to help him become more informed and assure him that every vote counts, regardless of age. - For the individual who doesn't want Hawaii to be part of the United States, engage in a dialogue about the importance of participating in the democratic process to voice their opinion and work towards change. Step 4: Create a supportive and informative environment - Develop an outreach program offering educational resources, workshops, and discussions about the importance of voting, the electoral process, and current political issues. Step 5: Share stories and promote conversations - Encourage others to share their experiences and reasons for voting, highlighting the impact that one vote can have in the larger political landscape. Step 6: Monitor progress and adapt - Keep track of the progress made by these six individuals and adjust the strategies and conversation approaches as needed. By addressing the reasons these nonvoters refrain from voting and providing them with the necessary resources and support, we may start to see a change in their participation in the electoral process and, ultimately, contribute towards increasing voter turnout in Hawaii."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

US Stocks Gain as Oil Prices Tumble US stocks made strong gains in late-day trading on Wednesday, as a tumble in oil prices boosted investor confidence about the economy, but thin volume meant dealers were skeptical about the strength of the rally. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a particular day in the US stock market, specifically focusing on the late-day trading session on a Wednesday. The primary theme revolves around an observed increase in US stock prices, which the writer attributes to a notable decrease in oil prices during that time. This decline in oil prices is thought to have positively impacted investor confidence in the economy, as lower oil prices can translate to reduced business costs and increased consumer spending due to lower gasoline prices. However, the text also implies that the trading volume on that specific day was relatively low, leading dealers and investors to express some skepticism about the sustainability and validity of the observed stock market rally. A low trading volume can indicate that fewer investors are participating in the market, potentially reducing the significance of the day's stock price movements. This hints at the possibility that the late-day rally might not be a solid indicator of continued growth or improvement in the stock market, but instead could be a short-term event driven more by market sentiment rather than long-term fundamentals. In summary, the text discusses a day in the US stock market when a sudden dip in oil prices led to a late-trading rally characterized by increased share prices. While the fall in oil prices seemingly boosted investor confidence in the economy, the thin trading volume on that day created doubts among market participants about the strength and longevity of the rally. It raises the question whether this increased stock market performance was due to strong economic signals or just a temporary market reaction to fluctuating oil prices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"(1).\\" sentiment (Options: (1). negative; (2). positive;).","completion":"Title: \\"The Abyss Speaks\\" Review: \\"The Abyss Speaks\\" emerges as a colossal disappointment in the realm of short films. The sheer lack of depth and creativity displayed throughout its painstaking 30-minute runtime leaves viewers yearning for the light at the end of this dreary tunnel. From the outset, the film's premise appears intriguing—a group of explorers venturing into undiscovered chambers of an ocean abyss, only to encounter the unknown. However, the plot quickly dissolves into an unappetizing hodgepodge of trite dialogue, flat characters, and feeble attempts at tension building. The egregiously inadequate character development exacerbates the film's overall lack of impact. The protagonist, Jim, fails to inspire any semblance of human emotion or connection. His character is riddled with clichés and tired tropes that make it difficult for viewers to invest in his self-realizations and struggles. Moreover, the supporting characters are equally one-dimensional, with no apparent motivation or purpose beyond serving as hollow echoes of Jim's already lackluster personality. In a movie focusing on the mysteries and untamed forces of nature, the visual effects are laughably substandard. The abyss, supposedly an awe-inspiring manifestation of earth's untapped depths, comes across as feebly contrived through unconvincing CGI. The creatures that supposedly inhabit these depths are more reminiscent of poorly designed characters in an outdated video game than the ferocious beings we were promised. Furthermore, the pacing is inconsistent, causing the narrative to stutter and lose momentum continually. The lackluster editing and abrupt scene transitions only contribute to the disintegration of the visual and storytelling coherence. Equally frustrating is the score, which oscillates from deafeningly loud and obnoxious to laughably inappropriate given the context, thereby consistently undermining the movie's already meager intensity. In conclusion, \\"The Abyss Speaks\\" miserably fails to deliver an engaging short film experience. Riddled with unsympathetic characters, subpar visual effects, and an incoherent narrative, it comes as no surprise that it is overwhelmingly negative in sentiment. There is no denying that its disappointments will undoubtedly weigh heavily on it, dragging it deeper into the abyss of forgettable cinema."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the two names of the work that was well received in Gothenburg in 1860? Answer the above question based on the context below: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \\"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \\"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \\"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\\" while noting that \\"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were \\"obvious influences\\" to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse.Curtis was unwilling to explain the meaning behind his lyrics and Joy Division releases were absent of any lyric sheets. He told the fanzine Printed Noise, \\"We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.\\" The other Joy Division members have said that at the time, they paid little attention to the contents of Curtis' lyrics. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they \\"just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing.

Edwin and Edward Bryant were standing outside about 3:15 a.m. in the 1300 block of North Hudson when a dark-color vehicle drove by and someone inside opened fire, according to Chicago Police. | Network Video Productions Twin 17-year-old brothers were killed in a drive-by shooting early Sunday in Old Town — among 17 people shot and killed in Chicago between Friday evening and Monday morning. It was the deadliest gun-violence weekend so far this year, according to homicide totals tracked by the Chicago Sun-Times. Besides those shot and killed, 41 other people were wounded in gun violence citywide. Edwin and Edward Bryant were standing outside about 3:15 a.m. in the 1300 block of North Hudson when a dark-colored vehicle drove by and someone inside opened fire, according to Chicago Police. The brothers were two of four teenagers shot dead in Chicago since early Saturday. The spike in violence over the weekend was on the mind of Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson when he addressed the media at Navy Pier Monday morning, after a graduation ceremony for the department’s newest officers. “It was a tough weekend,” Johnson said. “Clearly there were a lot more people outside, but you would think people would be in a better frame of mind given the fact that the Cubs are playing in the World Series,” he added. “The majority of these shootings this weekend were gang-related, we know that.” This year’s highest total for fatal shootings on a weekend had been 13; that number was reached on both Father’s Day and Labor Day weekends. In another particularly violent stretch, nine people were killed in city shootings and 13 others were wounded on Monday, Aug. 9. “Until we start holding repeat gun offenders accountable for these crimes, they’re going to keep seeing cycles of gun violence like this. The majority of these shootings this weekend were gang-related, we know that. But they just have no fear of the consequences of their actions,” Johnson said Monday. “These violent gun offenders are clearly giving us the message that they just don’t care about the rest of the city of Chicago. To be quite frank, I’m sick of it and I know the people in the communities are tired of it. That’s why we have to do a better job of holding those individuals accountable.” Johnson said that in the case of the Bryant twins, “we do have video footage of that incident. We’re making progress on it. The two brothers, as far as we could tell, they didn’t have any documented gang affiliation. But the individuals they were with did. So it’s possibly gang-related.” He added: “We are making substantial progress on a number of those cases over the weekend. We just have to ensure that we keep working hard and I know the detectives will.” Edwin Bryant was shot in the chest and back and was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:45 a.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office and police. Edward suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and head and was also taken to Northwestern, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later. The fraternal twins were juniors at Marshall High School in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side after transferring from Lincoln Park High School as freshmen, according to Edward’s youth basketball coach. Edward played basketball for the Marshall and for the Chicago Demons, a youth basketball program in Old Town, according to Chicago Demons Coach Vince Carter. Edwin also played basketball until middle school. Carter said Edward played on the Demons’ traveling team since 6th grade. Earlier this year, the Demons won the Bigfoot Classic in Houston and the Las Vegas Live tournament. About 30 teams competed in the tournament in Houston and about 75 teams in Las Vegas. “He was a big part of [those wins],” Carter said. Standing 6-foot-5, Edward played forward and could dunk, Carter said. He “had a Kevin Durant look…and had been coming into his own in the last few years.” He probably would have played college basketball, and Division I college teams “were looking at him.” “He played hard,” Carter said. “He loved basketball … but you had to push him to realize his potential.” Edward can be seen dunking at the end of the video below that was Tweeted by a teammate.

Why do golden rings create a shadow in the form of a heart? Do those questions have the same meaning? Options: -no. -yes.","completion":"To answer these questions, let's consider each one step-by-step: Question 1: How is shadow formed? Step 1: Identify light source A shadow is formed when there is a light source, such as the sun, a lamp, or any other illuminating object. Step 2: Recognize obstruction by an object When the light rays coming from the light source encounter an object, the object obstructs or blocks those rays. Step 3: Understand the blocked light Due to the object's opaque nature, it does not allow the light to pass through it, and thus the light doesn't reach the surface behind the object. Step 4: Shadow formation The area where the light is blocked on the surface behind the object appears darker compared to the surroundings, which is the shadow. Question 2: Why do golden rings create a shadow in the form of a heart? Step 1: Consider the position of the rings When two golden rings are placed one above the other with their rounded sides touching and their other ends apart, they create a shape that resembles a heart. Step 2: Light source The light source should be placed correctly to cast the shadow of the arranged rings. Step 3: Shadow cast When light falls on the arranged rings, they cast a shadow on the surface behind them in the shape of a heart, because of the way the rings are positioned. Question 3: Do those questions have the same meaning? Answer: no. Reason: While both questions are related to shadow formation, they address different aspects. The first question explains the general concept of shadow formation, while the second one is specific to a certain situation or object that creates a shadow in a particular shape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Rosa Luxemburg (also Rozalia Luxenburg; Polish: Roza Luksemburg; 5 March 1871 - 15 January 1919) was a Polish Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist, anti-war activist, and revolutionary socialist who became a naturalized German citizen at the age of 28. She was, successively, a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1915, after the SPD supported German involvement in World War I, she and Karl Liebknecht co-founded the anti-war Spartacus League (Spartakusbund), which eventually became the KPD. During the November Revolution she co-founded the newspaper Die Rote Fahne (\\"The Red Flag\\"), the central organ of the Spartacist movement. Context: Luxemburg was born on 5 March 1871, in Zamosc. She and her family were Polish Jews living in Russian-controlled Poland. She was the fifth and youngest child of timber trader Eliasz Luxemburg and Line Lowenstein. Luxemburg later stated that her father imparted an interest in liberal ideas in her, while her mother was religious and well read with books kept at home. The family spoke German and Polish, and Luxemburg also learned Russian. The family moved to Warsaw in 1873. After being bedridden with a hip ailment at the age of five, she was left with a permanent limp. Starting in 1880, Luxemburg attended a gymnasium. From 1886, she belonged to the Polish left-wing Proletariat Party (founded in 1882, anticipating the Russian parties by 20 years). She began political activities by organizing a general strike; as a result, four of the Proletariat Party leaders were put to death and the party was disbanded, though the remaining members, including Luxemburg, kept meeting in secret. In 1887, she passed her Matura (secondary school graduation) examinations. After fleeing to Switzerland to escape detention in 1889, she attended the University of Zurich (as did the socialists Anatoly Lunacharsky and Leo Jogiches), where she studied philosophy, history, politics, economics, and mathematics. She specialized in Staatswissenschaft (government science), the Middle Ages, and economic and stock exchange crises. Her doctoral dissertation, \\"The Industrial Development of Poland\\" (Die Industrielle Entwicklung Polens), was officially presented in the spring of 1897 at the University of Zurich, which awarded her a Doctor of Law degree. Her dissertation was published by Duncker and Humblot in Leipzig in 1898. She was an oddity in Zurich as she was one of the very few women with a doctorate. She plunged immediately into the politics of international Marxism, following in the footsteps of Georgi Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod. In 1893, with Leo Jogiches and Julian Marchlewski (alias Julius Karski), Luxemburg founded the newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza (\\"The Workers' Cause\\"), which opposed the nationalist policies of the Polish Socialist Party. Luxemburg believed that an independent Poland could arise and exist only through socialist revolutions in Germany, Austria, and Russia. She maintained that the struggle should be against capitalism, not just for Polish independence. Her position of denying a national right of self-determination under socialism provoked a philosophic disagreement with Vladimir Lenin. She and Leo Jogiches co-founded the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) party, after merging Congress Poland's and Lithuania's social democratic organizations. Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg was the principal theoretician of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP, later the SDKPiL), and led the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organizer.

Q: Abstract: The effects of electrical stimulation of the vagi on gas transport mediated by high-frequency, low tidal volume ventilation (HFV) was examined in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, propranolol-treated dogs. Gas transport efficiency was estimated by measuring the rate of CO2 removed from the lungs (Vco2) achieved during 45-s bursts of HFV applied before (control 1), during, and after (control 2) electrical stimulation of the transected vagi. During vagal stimulation the heart rate was maintained by electrical pacing. During the 15-s phase of vagal stimulation pulmonary impedance increased from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 2.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s, and Vco2 increased. When the electrical stimulation of the vagi was stopped, impedance and Vco2 returned to prestimulation values. Vco2 was always higher during electrical stimulation of the vagi when HFV of a fixed volume was applied over a range of frequencies or when a fixed oscillation frequency was used over a range of tidal volumes. The effects of vagal stimulation on HFV-mediated gas transport were quite similar to the effects of moving the locations of the bias flow inlet and outlet into the lung such that tracheal volume was decreased by 20 ml, an amount equivalent to estimated change in control airway volume thought to occur during vagal stimulation. We simulated the effects of vagal stimulation and decreased tracheal volume on Vco2 by using a previously described model of HFV-mediated gas transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) A:","completion":"Vagal Stimulation and High-Frequency Ventilation"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load? from the following article ? After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load?\\" is: 1. Semen: Andres Serrano used his own semen in creating the cover art for Metallica's \\"Load\\" album.

Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. - Edna Purviance (October 21, 1895 January 13, 1958) was an American actress during the silent movie era. She was the leading lady in many of Charlie Chaplin's early films and in a span of eight years, she appeared in over 30 films with him. - Silent Movie is a 1976 American satirical comedy film co-written, directed by, and starring Mel Brooks, and released by 20th Century Fox on June 17, 1976. The ensemble cast includes Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Bernadette Peters, and Sid Caesar, with appearances by Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Marcel Marceau, and Paul Newman playing themselves.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose album was called Hearts and Bones? ? The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline. At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The little Tootsie Pop boy can finally rest easy. Mathematicians at New York University conducted a very important experiment to find out exactly how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Drum roll, please. One thousand. For those patient enough to not take a bite, graduate student Jinzi Mac Huang determined it would take 1,000 licks to make it through one centimeter of candy, which is approximately half the length of one Tootsie Pop. The study was done to explore the effects of dissolving materials within a fluid flow, such as rocks in geological environments and pills for pharmaceutical applications. The lollipop angle was just a fun side effect. “We used these results to figure out in general how fluids dissolve materials, and we realized that that is basically what you’re doing when you’re enjoying a lollipop,” applied mathematics professor Leif Ristroph told ABC News. “Using that model, we can take an object of any size and kind of a typical flow speed that would be determined by how fast you lick candy, and then determine how long it would take for that to dissolve all the material away,\\" Ristroph said. Using that model and a giant homemade ball of candy, they got to the rough estimate of 1,000 licks, though the study conductors weren’t able test out the theory themselves. “We started to test it, and it’s hard. Resisting the temptation to just bite into one is tough,” Ristroph admitted. Tootsie Roll got in on the fun, too, when they heard that NYU was conducting the study by sending them boxes of lollipops for “research.” “How many licks is a question fans of our candy have asked us for decades,” Tootsie Roll Industries President Ellen Gordon told ABC News. “We’re thrilled that New York University has conducted a study to help find out how many licks it really takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop.” ||||| Not Candy Crushâ€”Scientists Identify Nature of Candy Sculpture A team of scientists has identified the complex process by which materials are shaped and ultimately dissolved by surrounding water currents. The study, conducted by researchers at NYUâ€™s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Florida State University, appears in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. â€œHow flowing fluids generate unique shapes through erosion or dissolution is complex and fascinating,â€? says Leif Ristroph, an assistant professor at NYUâ€™s Courant Institute and the paperâ€™s senior author. The researchers studied this effect by immersing hard candy in a water current. They found that a peculiar but consistent shape emerges and then persists before eventually vanishing. This same â€˜sculptureâ€™ results regardless of the candyâ€™s initial form and the speed of the water flow. The authors were also surprised to find that their work offers a long-sought answer to a question from childhood: How many licks does it take to reach the center of a lollipop? By formulating a theory for how flows cause dissolving and shrinking, the researchers calculated an estimate of about 1,000 licks. But the work addresses some serious science, too. Understanding how materials dissolve is at the heart of the chemical and pharmaceutical industriesâ€”their products rely on the incorporation of solid compounds into solutions within reactors and within the human body. The work also has relevance in geologyâ€”the research links the morphology of eroding and dissolving surfaces to the flows present, which could offer a way to explain the unusual but consistent shapes of landscapes and landforms. Conducted in NYUâ€™s Applied Math Lab, the study involved experiments using pieces of hard candy, cooked up by the researchers and measuring about two inches. Simple shapes, such as spheres or cylinders, were then placed in a water tunnel, which allows for washing of these bodies by well-controlled flows. The researchers captured the change of candyâ€™s shape using time-lapse photography and used these measurements to formulate a theory for how flows affect dissolving. The study was led by Jinzi Huang, a doctoral student at the Courant Institute, and also includes Professor Nicholas Moore of Florida Stateâ€™s Department of Mathematics. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Mathematicians at New York University discovered that it takes about 1,000 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened.Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and, over the next three years, practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari Mondial 3.2 and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and beaten. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling from Iraq's Rumaila oil field. Iraq invads Kuwait in August 1990 which begins the First Gulf War. With the fall of Kuwait, Uday proclaims \\"The Age of the Sheikhs is over!\\"Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14 year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party.

One-third ponder leaving Bay Area amid costs, congestion It is so difficult to keep up with the Joneses, especially while navigating through all the gridlock traffic, that a third of Bay Area residents are thinking about clearing out in the next few years. Housing costs and a lack of availability, high prices in general and traffic topped the list of concerns in the latest of a series of surveys of residents in the nine counties surrounding San Francisco Bay. Optimism was, in fact, pretty hard to find in the poll of 1,000 residents by the Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored public policy advocacy group. “This is our canary in a coal mine,” said Jim Wunderman, president and chief executive officer of the council, which has been pushing, often against the grain of public opinion, for more high-density housing to be combined with more transit options in already developed areas. Wunderman foresees trouble if nothing is done to ease the crunch. “We need to act with urgency,” he said about the need for more affordable housing. “We need to act decisively, and we need to act regionally to address the underlying problems of housing and traffic that are causing discontent and aggravation.” Photo: Lea Suzuki, The Chronicle Only 40 percent feel the region is headed in the right direction, and an equal percentage believe it is “seriously off on the wrong track,” according to the poll.

One-third ponder leaving Bay Area amid costs, congestion A mass exodus is not likely despite the fact that 34 percent of Bay Area residents said they are strongly or somewhat likely to move out. The poll found that an additional 54 percent of the respondents plan to stay put and 31 percent of those people are adamant about staying in the Bay Area. Still, a good many citizens are disgruntled. Only 40 percent feel the region is headed in the right direction, and an equal percentage believe it is “seriously off on the wrong track,” according to the poll. The most optimistic folk also happened to have the highest incomes. San Francisco residents were No. 1 in the region on the glum scale, with 52 percent saying the Bay Area is going off the rails, so to speak. The pessimism pretty clearly tracks the recent surge in Bay Area housing prices. Last year, 55 percent felt things were heading in the right direction. In 2014, 57 percent were looking on the bright side, the poll said. And, in case the source of people’s gloom wasn’t clear, pollsters asked folks to list their top three problems. Cost of living got the top score, with 25 percent of residents declaring it the most serious problem. Housing, with 23 percent, and traffic, with 13 percent, were next on the Bay Area’s list of big troubles. In all, 64 percent of residents in the survey identified cost of living, 48 percent named housing and 39 percent ranked traffic among their top three issues. The trifecta of complaints in 2016 pounded last year’s biggest concern — the California drought — like a heavy El Niño rainstorm. Only 1 percent of Bay Area residents named the lack of water as the biggest problem this year, compared with 24 percent last year. The results are in line with a previous poll released Wednesday by the Bay Area Council, which also showed a marked increase in concern about the availability and affordability of homes compared with previous years. Curiously, the majority of residents in that poll thought more housing and a better transportation system should be built outside the Bay Area. Neither Wunderman nor Sarah Sherburn-Zimmer, the director of San Francisco’s Housing Rights Committee, agrees with that solution. Sherburn-Zimmer says rent control, tighter eviction controls and more affordable instead of luxury housing would go a long way toward solving the problem. “San Francisco residents know that when you build luxury housing, rents and evictions in the surrounding neighborhood go up,” she said. “They don’t want whole neighborhoods being bulldozed so you can build housing for the wealthy.” The survey, conducted between Feb. 12 and March 9 by the Oakland research firm EMC Research, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Complete the following sentence. i could not get a bathtub in my guest bathroom because the Options are: a. bathroom was huge.; b. bathtub was huge.;","completion":"I could not get a bathtub in my guest bathroom because the bathtub was huge. Initially, I had planned on installing a beautiful, luxurious bathtub in the guest bathroom to provide my friends and family with a comfortable and relaxing bathing experience during their visits. I believed that the addition of a bathtub would not only increase the visual appeal of the bathroom but also create an atmosphere of warmth and serenity, making the guest's stay more enjoyable and memorable. However, upon careful measurement and consideration of my guest bathroom dimensions, I found that the bathroom simply could not accommodate the vast size of the bathtub I had chosen. While I was aware that bathtubs come in different shapes, sizes, and materials, the gorgeous, freestanding bathtub that I fell in love with was too large for the limited floor space in my guest bathroom. As a result of the bathtub's overwhelming size, it would not allow for enough clearance for other bathroom fixtures, such as the toilet, sink, and vanity, while still meeting safety codes and requirements. Additionally, the installation of such a large bathtub could potentially interfere with proper ventilation, window access, and doorway clearance, leading to reduced functionality and diminished overall bathroom experience for my guests. Given these obstacles, I realized that it would be more practical to opt for alternative solutions to enhance the guest bathroom experience. Some of the options I considered included installing an elegant, walk-in shower with stylish fixtures and a frameless glass enclosure, opting for a more compact, space-saving bathtub design, or forgoing the bathtub idea altogether in favor of adding unique and functional décor elements to create a spa-like atmosphere for my guests. Ultimately, while I was initially disappointed that my dream of having a grand, luxurious bathtub in my guest bathroom could not materialize due to the bathtub being huge, I realized that there were plenty of other creative and practical ways to make the space inviting, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Break out of a cycle of dependency whereby the addict relies on you and, in turn, your assistance inadvertently helps the person keep up the addiction. This is called negative enabling. Learn to say \\"no\\" and commit yourself to it; it is perhaps one of the most important components of bringing about transformation in an addict. It's also important to note that the addict will likely not respond well to your commitment to saying \\"no\\" since she may be used to getting what she wants and when. If the person is a family member or friend, you'll need to think about money in particular. Decide if you are willing to lend the person money or not. Many people don’t like to lend money knowing that it will be spent on drugs, whilst others see it as stopping the addict from perhaps committing crime and getting into further trouble if she is caught. Make up your mind about this matter and stick to it. If you don't want to lend money, firmly let the person know the reasons you are unwilling and don't waver. If you are willing to lend to the person, have her sign debtor's notes for each loan and let her know that you plan to pursue any unpaid debts. If the person does let you down, stop lending to her. In addition, don't enable the behavior or try to keep up with the person by joining in the drug use. You need to keep yourself safe first and foremost. Avoid covering up or making excuses for the person's behavior or taking over the person's responsibilities (whether they be work, family, or otherwise). Doing so shields the person from the negative consequences of her behavior. She needs to learn that what she is doing has adverse consequences. Very few people addicted to heroin manage to complete a detox and remain clean on their first attempt. If your loved one does relapse, don't lose faith and do something drastic like disown her or kick her out. Remember that most people relapse a few times before they make it. Even when the person is past the withdrawal stage, recovery is not yet a certain thing as it encompasses much more than just getting rid of the person's physical dependency on heroin. Heroin addiction is not all physical. When someone is trying to recover from heroin addiction, they also need to deal with the mental aspects of their addiction and the triggers that led the person to engage in the behavior in the first place. Even though the withdrawal symptoms might have gone, the mental addiction will still be there, urging her to use again. Thus, treatment will have to involve dealing with those underlying issues in order to truly remove the impetus to relapse. If (or when) the person fails, don't take it as a personal insult and instead offer support for the next time she tries. Be supportive and try not to be suspicious of the person all the time; appreciate that it is hard to overcome a heroin addiction and show compassion for this trial. Instead of nagging the person when she slips or falls on the path to recovery or trying to control her every move and behavior, offer understanding and empathy. The very fact that the person wants to try to get better and beat the addiction is encouraging. Remember that recovery is not linear, like going simply from point A to point B. There are lots of ups and downs. Don't keep asking the person if she is still clean or lecturing her about not starting again. If you're constantly nagging the person, she will begin to lose trust and comfortability with you and may even start keeping things from you. Offer provide praise and encouragement when the person does something to further her recovery or as a way to mark a milestone on the path to recovery (such as one-week sober or 30 days sober). This is also called positive enabling, which refers to behaviors that encourage change in a person addicted to drugs. Enable the person to continue her recovery and her path of change by reminding her that you love her and that you too are committed to her betterment. Once the person is receiving treatment, whether that be by entering a rehabilitation center, seeing a therapist, or going to meetings, remain an active part of their recovery process. Getting the person to get help and treatment with only the first stage of recovery. Your loved one will need your support in order to carry on with the treatment and be successful in beating the addiction. Show the person that you are invested in her and her long-term recovery. One way to stay involved is to try to attend therapy sessions or meetings that allow guests of people addicted to drugs. This may also help you build understanding and empathy as you will come to learn about heroin addiction and how it affects people. Inquire about the person's recovery. However, rather than ask the person in a Q-and-A format or other style that resembles an interrogation rather than a conversation (e.g. \\"Did you go to a meeting today?\\";\\"Did you talk in therapy today?\\", etc.), consider asking open-ended questions that allow the person to shape the narrative they want to tell (e.g., \\"How have the meetings been going?\\" and \\"Have you learned anything new about yourself throughout this process?\\"). Summary:","completion":"The article discusses methods on how to effectively help someone battling heroin addiction. This includes not enabling the addict's negative behavior known as \\"negative enabling.\\" It emphasizes the necessity of taking a firm stand, specifically saying \\"no\\" to the addict, which can potentially cause discomfort as they might be accustomed to getting their way. The article also considers financial interactions, advising one to make a decision whether to lend the addict money or not, and stick to it. Should you decide to lend money, the addict should sign debtor's notes, and if they fall short on their obligations, all future loans should be halted. Maintaining your safety is crucial and refraining from indulging in drug use with the addict or covering for the consequences of their actions is recommended. The addict should realize the adverse results of their behavior themselves. Relapses are common during recovery from an addiction, and the article advises that a relapse should not be a cause for shunning the individual. The recovery process is multifaceted, and not linear, involving both physical and mental detoxification. The mental aspect of addiction is linked to triggers which led to the addictive behavior and it is important that these are addressed in treatment to prevent relapse. Perseverance and patience are key to the recovery process, constant nagging or questioning could lead to distrust, instead, constructive engagement is advised. Positive enabling, which provides encouragement for change and recovery, is beneficial. Celebrating milestones in the recovery process can reinforce positive behavior. Continued support and involvement in the treatment process can significantly contribute to treatment success. This can include attending therapy sessions, meetings, showing constant investment and commitment to the recovery process. Creating a conversation about the recovery process rather than questioning in an interrogative manner builds trust and provides the recovering individual a chance to join the narrative about their journey to recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jesse says that he just recently discovered that the home he has been living in his entire life has had asbestos in it. Walter says that he has never lived in a home with asbestos. and a hint : Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. Please answer this question : Is Jesse's chance of having cancer higher or lower than Walter's? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given situation and information, it appears that Jesse's chance of having cancer is potentially higher than Walter's. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Jesse has been living in a home with asbestos present, which is a known carcinogen. Long-term exposure to asbestos fibers can lead to serious health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and other respiratory diseases. However, it is essential to consider other factors that may also contribute to an individual's overall cancer risk. As mentioned, there are dozens of chemicals that cause cancer, and some of these are present in tobacco smoke. If Walter or Jesse are smokers or have been exposed to significant amounts of secondhand smoke, their cancer risk could be further increased. Moreover, individual genetics, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures can also impact a person's cancer risk. Factors such as diet, exercise, sun exposure, and family history should be considered when assessing overall cancer risk. In summary, while Jesse's chance of having cancer may be higher than Walter's due to prolonged exposure to asbestos, it is crucial to consider a broader range of factors when determining overall cancer risk. The chances of developing cancer are influenced by a combination of factors such as genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures, so comparing their risks solely on asbestos exposure might not be an accurate representation of the complete picture. To get a better understanding of each individual's cancer risk, one should consider consulting a healthcare professional and possibly conducting a comprehensive risk assessment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Live Feed is set in some unnamed Chinese/Japanese Asian district somewhere as five American friends, Sarah (Ashley Schappert), Emily (Taayla Markell), Linda (Caroline Chojnacki), Mike (Lee Tichon) & Darren (Rob Scattergood) are enjoying a night on the town & taking in the sights. After a scuffle in a bar with a Japanese Triad boss (Stephen Chang) they decide to check out a porno theatre, as you would. Inside they are separated & quickly find out that the place belongs to the Triad boss who uses it to torture & kill people for reasons which aren't made clear. Can local boy Miles (Kevan Ohtsji) save them? This Canadian production was co-written, produced & directed by Ryan Nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well, one has to say that Live Feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety & success of Hostel (2005) & the mini craze for 'torture porn' as it's become known. According the IMDb's 'Trivia' section for Live Feed writer & director Nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres, for my money I reckon he wrote it after watching Hostel! The script is pretty poor, there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing & killing people, none. Was it for the Triads? Was it for his pleasure? Was it to make snuff films to sell? Some sort of explanation would have been nice. Also why did he turn on the Triad boss at the end? If your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about Live Feed. It seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex, S&M, horror, torture, gore & action films which doesn't come off. I mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn't automatically going to make your film any good, there still needs to be a decent script & story, right? The character's were fairly poor clichés & some of their actions & motivations were more than a little bit questionable. It moves along at a reasonable pace, it's fairly sleazy mixing gore, sex & nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect. Director Nicholson doesn't do anything special here, the editing is choppy & annoying, he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea & the film has a cheap look about it. Available in both 'R' & 'Unrated' versions I saw the shorter cut 'R' version which really isn't that gory but I am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the 'Unrated' version & say that it might be much, much gorier but I can't say for sure. There's a fair amount of nudity too if that's your thing. I wouldn't say there's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn't & aren't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it I suppose. Technically Live Feed isn't terribly impressive, the blood looks a little too watery for my liking & entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening, it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder & the choppy editing at least on the 'R' rated version is at times an annoying mess. Shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in Vancouver in Canada. The acting is poor, sometimes I couldn't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing... Live Feed is not a film I would recommend anyone to rush out & buy or rent, I didn't think much of it with it's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition & which goes nowhere, poor acting & less than impressive gore (at least in the 'R' rated cut anyway).

Please answer the following question: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious attempt on the part of the liar to... The writer of the passage _ .

Even before I knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me in. Gorgeous, talented and popular, these are performers to look out for. Ok, where do I start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago. His trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: well, take a pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality. Horror movies aren't supposed to be Shakespeare, but I'm not gonna go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It's up there with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's mask is childishly creepy, and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky. The acting is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are a lot of fun. I really did wish to see much, much more of Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of Denise Richards looked frightfully like her. Highlights: Every death scene had a particular distinction to it. The creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue. The hottub scene, while ludicrous, was well done.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Who was born first, Nikolai Chebotaryov or Leonid Khachiyan?","completion":"Nikolai Grigorievich Chebotaryov was born first, ahead of Leonid Genrikhovich Khachiyan. Chebotaryov was born on June 15, 1894, whereas Khachiyan was born much later, on May 3, 1952. The two mathematicians are known for their significant contributions to different fields of mathematics. Nikolai Chebotaryov was a Soviet mathematician from Ukraine. He was one of the leading algebraists during his time. He mainly worked in the fields of algebra, number theory, and complex analysis. Chebotaryov is best known for his work on Galois theory, particularly the Chebotaryov Density Theorem, which is an important result in number theory and algebraic geometry. Apart from this, he also played a significant role in the development of mathematical education in the USSR. Chebotaryov taught at various universities and founded the Kazan school of algebra as well as served as the head of departments at the University of Kazan. On the other hand, Leonid Khachiyan was an Armenian-American mathematician and computer scientist. He made considerable contributions in the field of mathematical optimization, specifically linear programming. Khachiyan is primarily famous for devising the ellipsoid method, a groundbreaking approach to solving linear programming problems. In 1979, his work on the algorithm paved the way for understanding the complexity of these problems and marked them as solvable in polynomial time. The ellipsoid method had a significant influence on the development of the field of optimization algorithms later on. Khachiyan was a professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he taught and researched until his untimely death in 2005. To summarize, Nikolai Chebotaryov was born first on June 15, 1894, and was a prominent figure in algebra and number theory. Leonid Khachiyan was born on May 3, 1952, and was a key contributor to the field of linear programming and optimization. Both of these mathematicians left a lasting legacy in their respective fields, making an enormous impact on how future generations would approach different mathematical problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Whose message said we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe in God nor in anything? is inside the article: In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480.

Writing for the New York Times, Dwyer describes the Macombs Dam Bridge he used to walk across as a boy, and how it was the site of a May 1971 ambush shooting of NYPD officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. He recalls four other NYC police officers viciously attacked (two of them, Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie, died) over the next year, noting that \\"in an instant this weekend, it seemed as though 43 years had not passed, and that it was 1971 again.\\" Ramos' and Liu's deaths shocked New York, which hadn't seen an officer fatally shot on duty since 2011, or partners die together since two auxiliary officers were gunned down in 2007, per the New York Daily News and the Officer Down Memorial Page.

He recounts the May 1971 ambush shooting of NYPD officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones on the Macombs Dam Bridge, an event that profoundly impacted the city. Within the next year, four other NYPD officers were violently attacked, with two of them, Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie, succumbing to their injuries. The heart-wrenching deaths of Ramos and Liu shocked the people of New York, who had not witnessed a fatal police officer shooting since 2011. The last time partners had died together was in 2007 when two auxiliary officers were gunned down. This tragedy underscores the dangers faced by officers in the line of duty. The composition of the NYPD has evolved through the years. Dwyer highlights the increased diversity, with officers hailing from 50 countries and speaking numerous languages. Today's Police Department is more representative of the city's multicultural landscape than ever before. Sadly, however, this diversity does not provide immunity from violence. Officers from various backgrounds, including those of African American and Caucasian descent, were targeted for their allegiance to the police force, not their skin color. The toxic environment on social media fuels hatred and contempt for those with different racial and political beliefs. Despite this barrage of negativity, Dwyer finds solace in the words of Ramos' aunt, who expressed hope that the community could find a peaceful way forward. The tragic deaths of NYPD officers Ramos and Liu, as well as their fallen colleagues from the past, serve as a painful reminder of the sacrifices law enforcement officers make to protect and serve their communities.

Given the question: Given the below context: The dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed. Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese.

Question: suppose more seismic waves occur happens, how will it affect less stronger earthquakes. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"If more seismic waves occur, it is likely that they will have some effect on less strong earthquakes. Let's break this down step by step: 1. Energy builds up in the crust of the Earth due to tectonic plate movement and other geologic processes. 2. This energy causes fault lines to give way, allowing the Earth's plates to move. The movement of these plates can lead to earthquakes of various magnitudes. 3. When an earthquake occurs, the energy radiates out from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves. 4. These seismic waves shake the Earth as they travel through it, which is what we perceive as an earthquake. Now, if there are more seismic waves occurring, it could potentially cause one or both of the following situations: A. The increased seismic wave activity might trigger other nearby faults to slip, causing additional less strong earthquakes. This would result in an overall increase in the frequency or number of smaller earthquakes. B. Alternatively, the increased seismic wave activity might cause some of the built-up energy in the Earth's crust to be released more frequently in the form of smaller earthquakes, rather than being stored up and released in one larger, more powerful event. Considering these possibilities, the answer to the question is A: more. The occurrence of more seismic waves could potentially lead to more less strong earthquakes, either by triggering additional smaller earthquakes or by causing the built-up energy in the Earth's crust to be released more frequently in smaller events."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead. When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them. Billy figured by doing this, the mobsters would send a goon to kill Trevor and with him out of the picture, he could have Laura back with no blood on his hands. However, since he was the one to notify the mobsters, they tell him if he wants Trevor dead he has to do the killing himself. He finds Trevor at Laura's house having just made love and kidnaps him at gunpoint. He takes Trevor to a field to kill him.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, calls women \\"slim\\" and \\"dames\\" and other such nonsense, is the only \\"real male\\" i.e. alpha male in the movie (the only other alpha male male being the head of Gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male), and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction. The character clichés are all here. Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in \\"Casablanca\\", and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him? It doesn't, so he can't be a cynic; Hawks wanted it both ways: a character who is both the \\"cool lone cynic\\" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. I don't think so... Bacall does her non-chalant \\"cool babe\\" routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not all-too interesting so-called \\"sexual innuendo\\" exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues sound silly by today's standards. \\"Just purse your lips and whistle...\\". A load of crap... She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older, and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (In real life she is very much like her face: a Hollywood bitch.)

He moves his skeptical wife Olivia and their daughter Lily into the house during the restoration project, and Olivia's aunt Connie, who has a fascination with the supernatural, comes to visit. During the restoration, George stumbles upon an enigmatic message scrawled on a wall hidden behind a painting, which reads, \\"The sparrows are flying again.\\" Intrigued, both by the message and the undeniable energy the house seems to carry, George and Connie decide to unravel the mystery. Olivia reluctantly agrees, fueled by her worry for her husband's growing obsession. Act 2: The Cryptic Clues George locates old newspaper articles and journals belonging to the property's previous owners, dating back a century. The journal of Abigail Winston implies a tumultuous love affair between Abigail and her husband Thomas. Thomas, entranced by occult practices, sought to capture a supernatural entity in sparrow form to harness its power. When Thomas disappeared, Abigail was left behind, penniless and heartbroken, believing she'd been abandoned. As George, Olivia, and Connie follow the cryptic clues left by Abigail, they begin to experience eerie occurrences around the house. Lily claims to see and interact with a young woman in Victorian clothing, who can control swarms of sparrows—a detail that chills her family. Act 3: Finding the Entity's Treasure Eventually, George uncovers Thomas's hidden occult library, filled with artifacts and lore regarding the supernatural entity known as \\"the Sparrow Queen.\\" George, Olivia, and Connie deduce that Thomas didn't abandon Abigail but was rather taken by the Sparrow Queen due to his growing obsession. As they push to find a method to release the trapped souls of Abigail and Thomas, the Sparrow Queen manifests. They learn that the Queen's immense power can only be passed on to a new host, whom she chooses once every century. Olivia, fearing that the Sparrow Queen intends to take Lily, agrees to participate in the ritual to save her child. Act 4: The Final Sacrifice The family scours the Victorian mansion for artifacts needed for the ritual to put Abigail and Thomas to rest and stop the Sparrow Queen's hold on the house. Aunt Connie, studied in occult practices, guides them through the ritual that navigates a harrowing spiritual realm, culminating in Olivia's heartfelt acceptance of the power to save her child. As the intensity climaxes, the Sparrow Queen releases Abigail and Thomas' souls into the afterlife and transfers her power to Olivia, who makes a selfless decision to channel her new energy into healing the world and sparing Lily from a cursed fate. In the end, the family is forever changed but united stronger than ever, as the power of love and sacrifice triumphs over darkness.

Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. After reading the above, is \\"Increases\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What happens to the size of the chest when the diaphragm muscle relaxes?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Increases\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What happens to the size of the chest when the diaphragm muscle relaxes?\\". The correct answer is \\"Decreases\\". When the diaphragm muscle relaxes, it causes the chest cavity to decrease in size, which in turn increases the air pressure inside the lungs and allows air to leave the lungs during exhalation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Explanation: Acid rain has the potential to affect the growth and development of mushrooms. While it doesn't directly impact any step of the mushroom growth process, it can indirectly affect the conditions in which the process occurs. Acid rain alters the pH of soil and water, which may in turn, affect the availability of nutrients, such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and nitrogen, which are vital for the growth and development of mushrooms. In the case of less acid rain, the soil conditions would be less acidic and more suitable for the growth of mushrooms, allowing for better nutrient absorption and overall healthier growth. This results in a positive indirect impact on the growth process of the mushrooms. However, since acid rain is not a direct part of the mushroom growth process itself, we can conclude that the perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper. So, assuming we can continue to move forward, that is something we would bring to our conference on the 7th when we have our two-hour immigration meeting,... House Leadership probably thinks that: - Lawmakers need more vacation time - Queen of the hill debate is wrong - Trump will not approve the immigration bill - not enough information Answer:","completion":"The issue of immigration and border security, particularly concerning the status of the 700,000 undocumented young people known as DACA recipients or Dreamers, has been a divisive and complex topic within the U.S. Congress. The recent effort by moderate Republicans to force a \\"queen of the hill\\" debate by gathering signatures on a rare discharge petition has been met with resistance from House leadership and conservatives. The petition requires 218 signatures to initiate the debate, with all 193 House Democrats expected to sign on, they are just two signatures away from this threshold. However, as Congress is currently in an 11-day holiday recess, this effort is temporarily on hold, allowing all party members to contemplate their future strategies. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face difficult re-election campaigns in their districts in November, making this issue particularly sensitive. The DACA debate has been ongoing since President Trump terminated the program last September, urging Congress to devise a permanent legislative solution. Upon their return to Washington, lawmakers face a critical deadline, as June 7 is the last possible date for the petition to mature before the seven-week summer recess begins. Representative Jeff Denham, a leader of the petition effort, has expressed that talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus have been productive. The caucus, a conservative voting bloc, seeks significant security concessions in return for a citizenship pathway for DACA recipients. Denham claims that an agreement in principle for a 12-year path to citizenship for Dreamers has been reached, but the challenge lies in putting that information on paper. The conference on June 7 will likely be the determining factor for any progress on this issue. House leadership may hold certain concerns or beliefs in this matter, such as: 1. Lawmakers need more vacation time, and as such an extended holiday or summer recess may be necessary. 2. They may think the \\"queen of the hill\\" debate is an inappropriate approach or does not adhere to regular legislative procedures. 3. House leadership could worry that President Trump will not approve the immigration bill, rendering their efforts futile or politically divisive. 4. They might believe that there is not enough information available to properly address the DACA recipients' issue, border security measures, and the overall immigration policy. Regardless of these concerns, the immigration issue remains a pressing matter in the U.S., and the fate of Dreamers in particular hangs in the balance. It is crucial for all sides to engage in productive discussions and strive to find a solution that both respects the rule of law and acknowledges the unique circumstances these young people face."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, You are given an amazon food product review and its summary.

Here is a question about this article: Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \\"having a gene\\" (e.g., \\"good genes,\\" \\"hair colour gene\\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles. What is the answer to this question: What do alleles do?","completion":"To answer this question, I'll extract the relevant information from the given article: The article mentions that alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, and these differences can cause different phenotype traits. So, in response to the question \\"What do alleles do?\\" the answer is: Alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, and these differences lead to different phenotype traits. They are essentially the different variants of a gene that exist within a population. The justification for this answer is based on my understanding of the information provided in the text.

Article: When people reunite with their loved ones, it's usually a wildly happy moment. But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange, but most of the time they break down in tears. Now a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of restoring emotional balance. \\" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher, told The Telegraph. Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \\"I want to eat you up!\\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. \\"We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies,\\" Aragon told The Washington Post. There are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream in horror at their idols. People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \\"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationship with others, and even how well people work together,\\" said Aragon. The psychologists then went further and claimed that the reverse was also true. Strong negative feelings may also bring out positive expressions. For example, people often laugh when they are nervous or they are in a difficult or frightening situation. Also, have you ever seen a character smiling at a time of extreme sadness in a movie? Their acting is not over... Question: The writer wrote the passage in order to _ .

David Petraeus, the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan, formally transferred authority Monday to incoming commander Marine Corps Gen. John Allen. Several senior Afghan and NATO officials, including U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, attended the change-of-command ceremony in Kabul. \\"Throughout, we will keep our eyes on the horizon -- the future of Afghanistan, \\" Allen told the audience, \\" a nation of free people at peace, governed under its constitution, pursuing economic enterprise and development, in a secure and stable environment free from the extremism and terrorism that has plagued this wonderful country and its people for more than a generation. In the end -- together we will prevail.\\" He inherits a force that is coming under renewed attack just as NATO prepares to begin the first phase of handing over provincial security to Afghan security forces. On Monday, three service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force were killed in a blast in eastern Afghanistan. Their deaths bring to 34 the number of international troops who have died in Afghanistan in July.. Since the start of this year, 314 coalition soldiers have died in the country. For his part, Petraeus plans to retire from the Army at the end of August and assume the CIA director's job September 6. \\"I wanted this job,\\" Petraeus, 58, said at his Senate confirmation hearing. \\"I am taking off the uniform I have worn for 37 years to do this the right way.\\" Dubbed King David for turning around what seemed like a losing battle as top U.S. commander in Iraq before he went to Afghanistan, Petraeus is considered a top general in his era, with Esquire magazine naming him one of the most influential people of the 21st century. He took over in Afghanistan on July 4 last year unexpectedly after a Rolling Stone magazine article prompted the resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. \\"We've jokingly said that I went to the White House for the monthly National Security Council meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan with President Obama, and came out with a new job,\\" Petraeus said. \\"And that's not far from the truth.\\" The U.S. military is losing the architect of modern-day counterinsurgency operations. Petraeus wrote his doctorate dissertation on the lessons America learned in Vietnam. Later, he devised the Army/Marine field manual, challenging the military to think differently about how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with a bloody insurgency. This week, ahead of his departure, Petraeus assessed the results of his strategy in Afghanistan. \\"What we have done is implement the so-called NATO comprehensive approach, a civil-military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006, and which we employed in Iraq in the surge of 2007-2008,\\" he said in an interview with NATO-TV. \\"I think generally, it has borne fruit.\\" He said it has been a difficult journey, rife with setbacks, but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the Taliban in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive Helmand province. Petraeus' experience in working with the CIA on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency's director. CNN's David Ariosto, Moni Basu and Samson Desta contributed to this report.

Gloriously irascible, the 27 year-old Scot mentally and technically outmuscled Tomas Berdych in what became something of a grudge match to reach his fourth Australian Open final at the Rod Laver Arena on Thursday. After a shaky start Murray played superbly – as well as he has done since winning Wimbledon – to advance 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in three hours and 26 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Australian Open: Murray wins 6-7 (6-8) 6-0 6-3 7-5 against Berdych. Andy Murray is through to the Australian Open final after beating Tomas Berdych in four sets in Melbourne. Murray shows his delight after booking his place in the Australian Open final for the fourth time in his career. Murray and Berdych shake hands after an intense semi-final showdown that lasted just shy of three and a half hours. Murray's fiancee Kim Sears celebrates her partner's victory on Thursday at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. Murray fought back from a set down to beat Berdych 6-7, 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in a match that lasted almost three and a half hours. Murray will play either Novak Djokovic or Stanislas Wawrinka in the Australian Open final on Sunday in Melbourne. There was little love lost in a contest which was transformed after Berdych said something at the changeover following the first set that clearly riled Murray. It had been boiling up before then, and even the normally demure Kim Sears became unusually animated, caught uttering the odd oath in the supporters' box. Murray admitted afterwards that there was an unusual edge to it all, given that he was in opposition to his ex-coach Dani Vallverdu for the first time. He drew on that, as was obvious when he broke back in the first set and directed his celebration towards his opponent's box. It might have been habit, but probably not. 'There was a little bit of extra tension, it was a big match,' said Murray. 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We have been friends since we were 15 years old. I thought it was a bit unfair to create a bit of extra tension out of it but it was there. Everyone calmed down after a bit.' Murray looked in supreme form again - as he has done for the past fortnight over in Melbourne. Dani Vallverdu, Murray's former coach, watches on from Berdych's box and Murray admitted that added 'extra tension' Murray gestures after losing the opening set on a tiebreak after fighting back from 5-3 down. The sun peaks through on a mild Australian evening in Melbourne as thousands watch inside the Rod Laver Arena. Berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to annoy Murray. 'I really remember it well. I say to myself \\"well done Tomas\\". That’s it. I think I’m allowed to do that when I win a set. What, I have to be worried about every word I am going to say? I just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair. Maybe next time I should stay even more calm, and that’s it. It was a great battle a good match, unfortunately with a bad end for me.' Murray, the 27 year-old Scot, also wanted to prove a point about his hiring of Amelie Mauresmo, saying: 'A lot of people criticised me working with her and I think so far this week we've shown that women can be very good coaches as well. 'Madison Keys who reached the semis here and had her best tournament is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward like that in the future. 'I'm very thankful for Amelie for doing it. It was a brave choice from her to do it and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' Murray fought back in the second set - beating Berdych to love in a stunning half hour of tennis. Murray had plenty of British supporters in the crowd as he looked to progress to the final. Berdych celebrates winning the first set after holding his nerve in the tiebreak. The No 6 seed added: 'I was obviously disappointed to lose the first set. I had a couple of chances at the end and break points at 5-5. I felt like I started to play better as the set went on and tried to stick to my game and was then very aggressive at the start of the second set. 'I changed tactics a little bit but also I was getting more comfortable with the conditions and the heavy ball that Tomas hits. In the second set I made him do most of the running. I started dictating the points, getting the first strike in. After losing a tough set like the first it as important to get the momentum back.' The reward is a fiendishly tough final, against either the world No 1 Novak Djokovic or defending champion Stan Wawrinka, who face off on Friday. Murray will have an extra day to recover, although historically that has never been a huge advantage here. Murray had to hurdle some advertising hoardings during an intense third set - which he eventually won. Murray's fiancee Sears watches on nervously at Rod Laver Arena as the semi-final unfolds on Thursday. Ester Satorova was also there to cheer on her fiancee Berdych - but he ultimately went down to Murray. Singer Kenny Rogers and former player Evonne Goolagong Cawley watched on from the stands as Murray progressed comfortably. On whether he would be watching their semi-final, Murray said: 'I will definitely watch a little bit but judging by their matches in the last couple of years here I might be in bed before they're finished. So far both have been playing fantastic tennis so whoever has got tickets for that is very lucky.' Less contentiously than the spats, there were also several technical aspects that underpinned one of the more memorable victories of Murray's career. The Scot's first serve was excellent, particularly the slider he has perfected out to the deuce court. His movement was superb, and he frequently outmaneuvered the 6ft 5in Czech around the baseline. A tendency of Berdych has been to serve in a predictable fashion, and when he tried to push Murray wide with the serve the British No 1 was more agile to respond, and he began to read it perfectly from the second set onwards. Berdych, the perennial nearly man, could not adjust his thinking as much as the master tactician Murray, who is now in his eighth grand slam final. The Czech didn't get a sniff after winning the tiebreak, with Murray far too strong for him. Murray pulled Berdych apart after losing the first set and goes into his fourth Australian Open final. Wimbledon 2013 - beat Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, 6-4. Australian Open 2013 - lost to Novak Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 3-6, 2-6. US Open 2012 - beat Novak Djokovic 7-6, 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2.

Setting: Paris, France Plot: Act 1: Avery Collins, a recent American college graduate with a degree in Music, arrives in Paris to explore her love for jazz. After finding a local guide, Julien, to show her the best sites and jazz clubs, they stumble into a hidden gem called \\"The Parisian Euphony,\\" a legendary underground jazz club founded during the 1920s by an African-American expatriate, Joseph Collins. This intimate venue has a rich history and has hosted some of the most famous Jazz artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Django Reinhardt. Intrigued by the coincidence in their last names, Avery embarks on a journey to discover if she has any relation to the club's founder. Act 2: Determined to keep the club's legacy alive, Avery learns to play Jazz with Julien, an accomplished jazz guitarist, and gradually integrates herself into the club's tight-knit community of musicians and patrons. Her ambition to restore the club to its former grandeur sets off a series of events that attract the attention of a wealthy real estate developer, Antoine Lefèvre, who has plans to repurpose the prime location for a luxury hotel complex. Avery and Julien then learn that the club is on the brink of foreclosure and must take immediate actions to save it. Simultaneously, Avery's research into her family history reveals that she is a direct descendant of Joseph Collins, who not only contributed significantly to the Parisian jazz scene but was also part of the French Resistance during World War II. Deeply moved by her connection to the club's founder, Avery becomes even more determined to preserve the club's vibrant history and the spirit of her ancestor. Act 3: As the looming threat of the club's closure grows, Avery and Julien devise a plan to host a grand benefit concert, inviting some of the biggest names in the Jazz world to perform, including a renowned jazz musician who got their start at the very venue, Nathalie Dupont. With Avery's passion for the cause and Julien's connections within the Parisian jazz scene, the concert garners widespread attention among the Parisian cultural community and draws the interest of a wealthy and mysterious benefactor, Mr. Girard. The benefit concert is a smashing success, with Nathalie Dupont delivering a soul-stirring tribute to Joseph Collins and the rich history of Parisian Jazz. Following the concert, Mr. Girard reveals himself to be a descendant of a French Resistance member who served alongside Joseph Collins, inspired by their past connection; he decides to buy and preserve the club as a historical and cultural site.

One of the uses for scales that assess sexual orientation is determining what the prevalence of different sexual orientations are within a population. Depending on subject's age, culture and sex, the prevalence rates of homosexuality vary depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed: sexual attraction, sexual behavior, or sexual identity. Assessing sexual attraction will yield the greatest prevalence of homosexuality in a population whereby the proportion of individuals indicating they are same sex attracted is two to three times greater than the proportion reporting same sex behavior or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Furthermore, reports of same sex behavior usually exceed those of gay, lesbian, or bisexual identification.

The band's members are Adam Lazzara (lead vocals), John Nolan (lead guitar, keyboards, vocals), Eddie Reyes (rhythm guitar), Shaun Cooper (bass guitar) and Mark O'Connell (drums). The band has released three studio albums with various past members Fred Mascherino (guitar, vocals), Matthew Rubano (bass guitar), and Matthew Fazzi (guitar, keyboards, vocals). On June 10, 2005, it was announced that the band had signed with major label Warner Bros. Records and would begin recording their third album later in 2005. That month, the group contributed \\"Error: Operator\\" to the video-game adaption of Fantastic Four, and it was later added to the film's soundtrack as well. On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). On April 25, 2006, Taking Back Sunday released their third album, entitled Louder Now, on Warner Bros. Records. The members' comments on the album reflected the dramatic change the band had undergone in the two years since their last release. Matt Rubano noted that the move to a major label was not something the band took lightly, but it was a move that made sense given the band's tumultuous past. Lazzara stated that fans seemed to feel their live shows had more energy than their recordings, and that Louder Now brought more of that across. Taking Back Sunday received mainstream exposure by appearing on the late night talk shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as the teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation in an episode entitled \\"What's It Feel Like To Be A Ghost?\\". In December 2006, the band released its first documentary, Louder Now: PartOne, featuring behind-the-scenes tour footage and four live concerts. Following months of touring to support Louder Now, Taking Back Sunday appeared in the American leg of Live Earth on July 7, 2007. During the summer of 2007, Taking Back Sunday was also a part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour, along with My Chemical Romance, HIM, and several other bands. On October 30, 2006, the band's former record label, Victory Records, released Notes from the Past, which featured four songs from Tell All Your Friends, six songs from Where You Want To Be, and two B-sides: The Ballad of Sal Villanueva and Your Own Disaster ('04 mix).

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. What did the friars record on their parchment scrolls?

The project to build a base on the moon will begin soon after 2020, with astronauts living there within four years. The project comes after several excellent scientists and environmentalists asked humans to look beyond Earth to ensure the survival of the species . Eventually, the moon will be a base for humans to explore the solar system and one day land on Mars. NASA began planning for the first moon landing since 1972 when George Bush, the US president, announced his new plan for space exploration four years ago. NASA has already talked about the design of the Orion spacecraft that will replace the old space shuttle fleet in 2010. The plan for the moon base, however, is the first detailed explanation of how NASA intends to prepare for the first manned exploration of deep space and a possible Mars mission within 30 years. Scientists also believe that the south pole on the moon contain rich natural gases such as the rare helium-3 that could be used as fuel for the generation of nuclear power. Besides, teams of astronauts living there for six months at a time would mine for hydrogen and oxygen to make water and possibly rocket fuel.

Vinalhaven, situated in Knox County, is a part of the Fox Islands in Penobscot Bay. The referenced island community building built in 1911-12 is the Vinalhaven Town Office & Memorial Library building, which is also known as the 'Home for Aged People.' The Vinalhaven Town Office & Memorial Library building is an impressive three-story edifice constructed in a High Victorian Gothic architectural style. Designed by prominent architect Carl F. Bryant, this community building served multiple purposes, including as a library, town offices, and meeting place for the island's residents. Originally funded by a donation of 15,000 by two leading Vinalhaven islanders William A. Calderwood and John O. Woster, the building was specifically constructed to cater to various purposes, thereby fulfilling their vision of a multi-use community space for the island residents. In its initial years, the community building housed the town offices, public meeting spaces, a library, and a designated area for the elderly. Over the years, the island's population has fluctuated, and the building continues to be utilized for official and public purposes, though the facilities and their usage have evolved. The Vinalhaven Town Office & Memorial Library building holds significant historical value and reflects the rich heritage and solidarity of the Vinalhaven island community.

I. no II. yes","completion":"The two questions, \\"How many months does it require to prepare for the CAT?\\" and \\"How many months does it take to prepare for the CAT exam?\\" are indeed asking the same thing. Both questions are inquiring about the time required to prepare for the CAT exam. So the answer to your question is, II. yes, these two questions are asking the same thing. Now, let's address the primary question regarding the preparation time for the CAT examination. The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a highly competitive exam conducted by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) for admission to postgraduate management courses in prestigious management institutes across India. The duration of preparation for the CAT exam varies depending on the individual's academic background, familiarity with the test format, and personal learning pace. On average, most candidates require 6 to 12 months of intense preparation to achieve a good score on the CAT exam. However, it is essential to remember that this is just a general guideline and can differ from one candidate to another. Factors that can influence the duration of preparation include: 1. Academic background: If a candidate has a strong foundation in Mathematics, Logical Reasoning, and English, they may require less time for preparation than someone who needs to build or strengthen these fundamentals. 2. Prior exposure to similar exams: Candidates who have previously appeared for similar aptitude tests may be familiar with the test format and question patterns, which may reduce preparation time. 3. Study schedule: A consistent and comprehensive study schedule can help candidates cover the vast syllabus effectively and make the best use of the available time. Moreover, balancing work or other commitments with study time can impact preparation duration. 4. Learning resources: Access to quality learning materials, coaching classes, and mock tests can help candidates get a better understanding of the exam format and difficulty levels. This can contribute to a more focused and efficient preparation process. 5. Individual learning pace: Every candidate has a unique learning style and pace. Some may grasp concepts faster, while others might need more time for in-depth understanding and practice. To ensure adequate preparation, it's crucial to start by evaluating your academic strengths and weaknesses, set realistic goals tailored to your individual needs, develop a strategic study plan, and regularly review your progress. Regular mock tests, performance analysis, and focused improvement will play a vital role in determining your optimal CAT exam preparation duration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Possible A: advertisement, magazine, store, web page, bus Why is \\"store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Store\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense in the context of the question because it provides a logical and relatable scenario. When we break down the question and the given information, we can understand why \\"store\\" makes the most sense. Question: He got a job dancing and waving an advertisement, he got to be outside instead of stuck inside the what? The question describes a situation or a job where the individual is required to dance and wave an advertisement. From this context, we can deduce that the person must have been involved in some form of promotional activity or marketing campaign. It is common for businesses and stores to hire people to dance, wear costumes, or wave signs outdoors to attract customers' attention and increase foot traffic inside the establishment. Now, let's analyze each possible answer: A. Advertisement This option doesn't make sense as an answer because the question already mentions the individual waving an advertisement. Being stuck inside an advertisement isn't a plausible scenario, as advertisements are not physical places. B. Magazine A magazine, like an advertisement, is not a physical location where a person can be \\"stuck inside.\\" Magazines contain advertisements but are not directly related to the context. C. Store A store is a physical location where people work, shop, and conduct business transactions. A person can be inside a store and interact with customers or perform various tasks related to the job. So, the individual's prior job could have been an indoor position at a store. The new job as an advertisement waver allows them to be outside in contrast to their previous role. D. Web page A web page is a digital platform, not a physical location, so it doesn't align with human common sense to be a suitable answer. People cannot be physically \\"stuck inside\\" a web page. E. Bus Although a bus is a physical location, it doesn't align with the context of the question. Generally, buses are not associated with dancing or waving advertisements. Individuals who work in buses typically have roles such as drivers or ticket collectors. Based on this analysis, \\"store\\" is the most aligned answer with human common sense because it offers a relevant and plausible scenario. A person working inside a store as an employee, and later obtaining a job as a dancer or waver for an advertisement, would likely appreciate the opportunity to work outdoors instead of being confined within the store premises. This connection between the two job environments makes \\"store\\" a sensible choice in this context."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Last year, during the month of October, something very interesting happened to him. Now remember, October is that fun month when you go trick-or-treating on Halloween! But our story is not about Halloween candy. It’s all about computers and email. You see, an email is like a letter, but instead of sending it through the mail with a stamp, people send it through the internet. It's like when mommy sends a message to daddy when he's away at work. But sometimes, people want to peek into others' letters, which is not nice at all. And this is what our friend Mohareb was accused of doing - sneaking a peek into his friend’s email without them knowing! Hacking, the term used to describe what Mohareb allegedly did, is a bit like opening someone else's toy chest without their permission. Imagine if one of your friends came into your room and opened your treasure box of toys without asking you. They would find all your special things inside, and you might not feel safe anymore. This is how Mohareb's colleague must have felt when they thought their email account was being looked into. Just like you would protect your favourite toys, they called for help to protect their emails. So, what happened to Mohareb after he was accused? Well, he was arrested. That might sound a little scary, but it's like when you break a rule, you might get a time out, so you can think about what you did wrong. When grown-ups break important rules, like not respecting others' privacy, they sometimes have to deal with more serious consequences like getting arrested.

With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US.

Q:- The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process after the liver releases glucose into the blood is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range. This is achieved through the following sequence of events: 1. As glucose is released into the bloodstream by the liver, blood sugar levels begin to rise. This increase in blood glucose is detected by the body's various monitoring systems, particularly the pancreatic cells responsible for producing and releasing hormones involved in glucose regulation. 2. When blood sugar levels return to a normal range, the alpha cells in the pancreas, responsible for glucagon secretion, stop producing and releasing glucagon. This action helps to prevent further breakdown of glycogen into glucose, thereby preventing blood glucose levels from rising too high. 3. At the same time, the beta cells in the pancreas detect the rise in blood glucose levels and respond by producing and releasing insulin. 4. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells throughout the body to absorb and utilize glucose for energy. Its presence signals the cells to take in glucose from the blood, which further helps to stabilize and maintain normal blood sugar levels. In summary, the last step of the process is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range, which is achieved through the interplay of pancreatic hormones (glucagon and insulin) and their regulation of glucose production, release, and absorption by the liver, muscles, and other tissues throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a \\"performance\\" by the lawyers. \\"It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,\\" Wu said. \\"Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case.\\" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, \\"but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers\\", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. \\"It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What to the punk rocker's friends steal? ? In the Mojave Desert, a policeman pulls over a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu driven by Dr. J. Frank Parnell. The policeman opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind. Otto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud drives up and offers him 25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood. Otto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a \\"repo man,\\" and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job. After repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a 20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual value of the car. Parnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu, but he is unable to meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand's competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Otto's punk friends, who are on a crime spree, steal the Malibu.

Article: Traffic Management Traffic lights are key tools for regulating traffic How.They are not, however, perfect.Drivers exchange the traffic jams that would happen at unmanaged crossings for a pattern of stop-go movement that can still be annoying, and which bums more fuel than a smooth passage would. Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications. For a driver to benefit, lie must load the team's software , named SignalGuru, into his phone and then put it on a special thing attached to the inside of his car's windscreen, with the camera lens pointing forward.SignalGuru is designed to detect traffic lights and track their status as red, yellow or green.It broadcasts this information to other phones in the area that are fitted with the same software, and --if there are enough of them ?the phones thus each know the status of most of the lights around town.Using this information, SignalGuru is able to calculate the traffic-light schedule for the area and suggest the speed at which a driver should travel in order to avoid red lights. Tests in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where five drivers were asked to follow the same route for three hours, and in Singapore, where eight drivers were asked to follow one of two routes for 30 minutes, revealed that SignalGuru was capable of predicting traffic-light activity with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.3% respectively, in the two cities.This was particularly impressive because in Cambridge the lights...

On land, dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top.

The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was only fourteen when wed? At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.

Which official knocks three times on the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons at the state opening of a British parliament????","completion":"The official who knocks three times on the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons at the state opening of a British parliament is known as the Black Rod. The Black Rod is a senior officer within the parliamentary administration, whose full title is the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod or Lady Usher of the Black Rod, depending on the holder's gender. The Black Rod plays a crucial role in the ceremonial opening of the British parliament, known as the State Opening of Parliament, which marks the beginning of a parliamentary session. The State Opening of Parliament is an event attended by the British monarch, who delivers the Queen's Speech, outlining the government's agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session. It is a highly formalized occasion, steeped in tradition and rich in symbolism. The event begins with the preparation and securing of the Palace of Westminster, which houses both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Members of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British parliament, then gather in their chamber, awaiting the arrival of the monarch. Meanwhile, the members of the House of Commons, the lower house of the British parliament, assemble in their own chamber, presided over by the Speaker of the House of Commons. The Black Rod is responsible for summoning the members of the House of Commons to attend the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords. To do this, the Black Rod proceeds from the House of Lords to the House of Commons, accompanied by an entourage of parliamentary officials. Upon reaching the entrance of the House of Commons' chamber, the ritual knocking takes place. The doors to the chamber are slammed shut in the face of the Black Rod, symbolizing the independence of the House of Commons and its resistance to the influence of the monarch. The Black Rod then knocks three times on the door with their staff, a three-foot-long ebony rod topped with a gold lion, from which the title \\"Black Rod\\" originates. The knocking is a request for permission to enter the chamber and summon the MPs to the House of Lords. Following the knocking, the door to the House of Commons chamber is opened, and the Black Rod enters the chamber, bowing to the Speaker of the House. They then announce to the assembled MPs, \\"The Queen commands this Honourable House to attend Her Majesty immediately in the House of Peers.\\" This summons the MPs to proceed to the House of Lords and hear the Queen's Speech. The MPs follow the Black Rod into the House of Lords, led by the Speaker and other ceremonial figures. This elaborate ritual at the State Opening of Parliament emphasizes the centuries-old power dynamics between the monarchy, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, as well as the roles they play in the British constitutional structure. The Black Rod's role as the official who knocks three times on the chamber door highlights the importance of tradition and ceremonial proceedings in British parliamentary life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I can use this background: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. Now, I have a new situation: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. Answer this question please: Would patient B be shorter or taller than patient D? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, Turner syndrome causes characteristic features such as short stature in affected females. Since Patient B is a female with Turner syndrome and Patient D is a female without any of these illnesses, Patient B would likely be shorter than Patient D.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: In all relationships, communication is key. Many fights and misunderstandings stem from a lack of communication. Going forward, it's important to be 100% honest about your actions and feelings in your friendship. If an issue arises in the future, make it clear that you'd like to resolve those issues by talking with each other instead of talking to other people or doing something that either of you may regret. Bring issues up immediately instead of bottling up your feelings. When we suppress feelings and emotions, we are more likely to boil over and say or do something we regret. If a problem arises, address it right away. It is important to know what you and your friend expect out of a friendship in order for it to work. For example, you may deal with situations differently, or some things may bother you more than others. This is why you must establish expectations. Tell your friend what you need from them in a friendship. Being honest will help your friend to better meet your needs. Explain to your friend what you need from them using the \\"I-message\\" formula: \\"I feel _____ when you _______ and I need for you to _______.\\" Refrain from assigning blame to your friend, though. Ask your friend what they need from you in a friendship. Again, friendship is a two-way street. Therefore, you need to meet your friends needs as well. Ask them to be honest about how you can be a better friend to them. Be ready to meet both needs. Resolution begins when you start understanding each other and the situation. As you hear similar needs from each other, the differences are put aside and you are able to work things through. It's impossible to move forward if you are unable to forgive. Holding onto anger or grudges isn't healthy for you and will ruin any chance you have of a real friendship. It takes a lot of strength to forgive, but it will help you grow as a person and as a friend. Tell your friend that you forgive them – it is an important factor in rebuilding trust for both of you. It will mean a lot to your friend to hear that you forgive them, and saying \\"I forgive you\\" will help you move on from the situation. If you cannot forgive this person for their actions, you cannot be friends with him or her. Trying to have a relationship with someone you hold anger towards isn't healthy for you or for them. Life is too short to hold grudges.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of open communication, honesty, and forgiveness in maintaining healthy friendships by addressing issues promptly, understanding expectations, and using \\"I-messages\\" to express needs without assigning blame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. Which brother was more at risk for atherosclerosis? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information and hint, it seems that Liam is more at risk for atherosclerosis. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Atherosclerosis is a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of arterial walls. This leads to the formation of plaques that can restrict or block blood flow. 2. High cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. 3. Liam has been diagnosed with high cholesterol, while Rudy's cholesterol is within normal parameters. This indicates that Liam has a greater amount of cholesterol that could potentially contribute to plaque formation in his arteries. 4. Since the presence of cholesterol is a major factor in the development of atherosclerosis, and Liam has higher cholesterol levels than Rudy, it can be inferred that Liam is more at risk for developing atherosclerosis. Therefore, the brother who is more at risk for atherosclerosis is Liam, due to his high cholesterol levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who was World Chess Champion immediately prior to Bobby Fischer?","completion":"The World Chess Champion immediately prior to Bobby Fischer was Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union (Russia). Boris Vasilievich Spassky was born on January 30, 1937, in Leningrad, USSR. He is a French-Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion. He was the tenth World Champion, holding the title from 1969 to 1972. Spassky won the crown from Tigran Petrosian and lost it to Bobby Fischer. His emphasis on logical and strategic play earned him a reputation as one of the most universal players of his era, being highly skilled in all aspects of the game. A prodigious talent in his youth, Spassky achieved major successes early in his career; he became an International Grandmaster in 1955 at the age of 18 and won the World Junior Championship in 1955, the USSR Chess Championship twice (1961, 1973), and the Mar del Plata tournament in 1960. In the 1969 World Championship match, Boris Spassky defeated Tigran Petrosian to become the World Champion. Over a period of two months, the two players competed in Moscow, Russia, with Spassky finally emerging as the victor 12.5 to 10.5, successfully claiming the world title. Spassky would go on to lose his World Championship title to Bobby Fischer, an American chess grandmaster, in what is arguably the most famous chess match in the history of the game, often referred to as the \\"Match of the Century.\\" The event took place in Reykjavík, Iceland, from July 11 to August 31, 1972. The Cold War tensions added to the significance of the match. The match captured the world's attention and was viewed as symbolizing the political confrontation between the two superpowers. Fischer's victory ended 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship. Following his loss, Spassky continued to be an active and strong player, competing in many tournaments and even contending for the World Championship title again, but he never regained the title. Besides Russia, he also represented France in the Chess Olympiad after he gained French citizenship in 1978. Boris Spassky is an important figure in the world of chess. Despite losing his title to Bobby Fischer, his skill and vast contribution to the game have left a lasting impact, making him one of the game's greats. His games, marked by a combination of tactical sharpness and strategic soundness, continue to be studied by aspiring players around the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Q: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell in the third phase of what process?

Article: A lot of grown-ups worry that spending too much time playing video games isn't good for a kid's health. Now some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their hand-held game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. These patients also seem to experience less pain when they are concentrating on a superhero adventure or a car race. At the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland, young patients are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called the Hospital-based On-line Pediatric Environment (HOPE). Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer filter wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must be hooked up to dialysis machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play online sports, racing, and adventure games with each other. Eventually they will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who are suffering from the same problem. \\"We want to use the power of the Internet to bring together kids who feel that they are separated by their illness, and let them know that they are not alone,\\" said Arun Mathews, the doctor who heads the program. He loves video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video game programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players get rid of cancer cells. That's all great news, because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal faster. Question: Which of the following plays the most important role in the HOPE project?

A preacher witnesses his family and a group of refugees seeking shelter in his church murdered by a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Colonel Cusack. After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie, takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack. Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses. The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang.

Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails. Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood. Some of them also lose their tail. In humans, the tail is reduced to the tail bone. Thus, similarities organisms share as embryos may be gone by adulthood. This is why it is valuable to compare organisms in the embryonic stage.

Bob was a medical student and he studied drugs administered to people with viral diseases, while his colleague Liam decided to study other types of drugs, such as antibiotics and anticoagulants. Which colleague studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs? A:","completion":"In this scenario, Liam, who decided to study other types of drugs such as antibiotics and anticoagulants, would have studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs in comparison to Bob. Bob, the medical student who focused on drugs administered to people with viral diseases, would have been more involved in the study of antiretroviral drugs. Antiretroviral drugs are a class of medications that help suppress the replication of retroviruses within an infected person's body, specifically treating diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since antiretroviral drugs are specifically designed to target viral diseases, Bob's area of study would have naturally led him to learn more about these types of drugs and their development. On the other hand, Liam is focused on studying antibiotics and anticoagulants. Antibiotics are medications used in the treatment of bacterial infections. These drugs target and eliminate bacteria, not viruses; thus, they are less relevant to the study of antiretroviral drug development. Anticoagulants, also known as blood thinners, are medications that help prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger within the body. These drugs are used to treat or prevent various conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Anticoagulants do not address viruses or bacteria directly and would not typically be connected to antiretroviral drug development.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: \\"Room for improvement\\" Review: I'm giving the de.blinkt.openvpn app a 3-star rating, for it sits comfortably between brilliance and mediocrity. The ability to create a secure internet connection using a virtual private network on my mobile device is absolutely valuable in today's digital world. Moreover, the provision to allow safe and encrypted connections renders this app a worthy companion for web surfers. Difficulties start popping up from the initial setup. Despite being tech-savvy, I found the configuration process somewhat complicated and less user-friendly. A novice user may face even more hassles while setting up their VPN connection. Improved guidance with a simplified setup process would go a long way in boosting the user experience. The performance of the app isn't entirely stable. While it delivers fairly reliable connections most of the time, I have still experienced some fluctuating speeds. On some days my internet speed was fantastic with no noticeable lag, on others, it left much to be desired. Improvements on this front would deepen the usability of the app. One positive aspect I'd like to highlight is the minimalistic design and ease of navigation. Post-setup, hopping between different tabs and options doesn't feel like a chore. However, the app sometimes hangs and crashes, which disrupts the navigation experience. Stability updates could possibly rectify this issue. All in all, de.blinkt.openvpn has the potential to be a great app but falls short with some speed and stability issues. With more streamlined functionalities and stronger performance, I can easily see myself boosting my rating from a lukewarm three stars to an enthusiastic four or even a full five-star rating. Justification: The objective was to write a 3-star review based on the package de.blinkt.openvpn. A 3-star review implies that the app has both pros and cons, rather than being entirely good or bad.

Runoff: Water near the shore often receives runoff from land, which can contain organic materials, minerals, and other nutrients. These nutrients enter the nearshore water and dissolve, thereby increasing the concentration of nutrients close to the shore. 2. River inputs: Many rivers and streams discharge into the ocean or other water bodies, carrying nutrients from terrestrial environments. Water near the shore, where freshwater inputs are more significant, will have a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients than water further away from the shore. 3. Coastal upwelling: Coastal upwelling occurs when winds push surface water away from the shore, and cooler, nutrient-rich water from deeper areas rises to replace it. This process effectively brings nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface and increases the concentration of dissolved nutrients near the shore. 4. Mixing: Water near the shore, particularly in estuaries and bays, often experiences greater mixing due to tides, currents, and wind action. This mixing can bring nutrients from deeper waters to the surface, increasing dissolved nutrient concentrations near the shore. 5. Human activities: Anthropogenic sources, such as wastewater discharge and runoff from agricultural lands, can increase the nutrient concentration near the shore. These activities can introduce excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus into coastal waters, contributing to eutrophication. In contrast, water far from the shore has fewer of these nutrient sources, so it typically exhibits lower dissolved nutrient concentrations. This can lead to a more oligotrophic environment with lower primary productivity of phytoplankton and other organisms that rely on these nutrients to thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Sir Edmund Hillary is best known for being the first, along with climbing partner Tenzing Norgay, to reach the top of Mount Everest . However, he also made many visits to Antarctica . In 1957, he led the first trip over ice to the South Pole. Hillary also helped his home country, New Zealand, build a research center on Antarctica, called Scott Base. He visited it in January 2007, when he was 87 years old. In the 1900s, many people like Hillary saw Antarctica as an exciting place. Scientists are interested in how glaciers flow and melt. They also worry that global warming is making glaciers melt faster. It has caused a 75 percent increase in ice loss in the last 10 years, according to a new study. Scientists say ice loss could cause water levels around the world to rise faster than expected. Ice is melting faster than expected because of global warming. Researchers in Antarctica are studying many other subjects too. Some use the cold weather and clear air as a way to study things that affect other parts of the globe. Antarctica has the cleanest air in the world. That allows scientists to compare the air there to the air in polluted places. Antarctica is the darkest place on earth, so it is a great place to study the stars. Some scientists are even studying penguin droppings . They have developed a new test to learn more about penguins' diets.

We arrived in the summer, just in time to enjoy the midnight sun. All that sunlight was fantastic for Mom's vegetable garden. Working in the garden at midnight tended to throw her timing off, so she didn't care much about my bedtime. Dad was a Railway Express agent and Mom was his clerk. That left me in a mess. I usually managed to find some trouble to get into. Once I had a little Are going in the dirt basement of a hotel. I had tried to light a barrel of paint but couldn't really get a good fire going. The smoke got pretty bad, though, and when 1 made my exit, a crowd and the police were there to greet me.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The given statement is already in English. However, I can provide a more detailed and longer explanation of the statement to provide better understanding. The statement provided refers to how the majority of Russian citizens were supportive of the conclusion of autocratic rule in their country, despite having differing opinions on various other matters. Autocracy is a system of governance in which the ruler has unlimited power and authority. In the context of Russia, this most likely refers to the period of the Russian Empire and the reign of the Tsars, who had complete control and dominance over the nation's governance. Although the population of Russia celebrated the end of autocratic rule, it is important to note that their agreement on this subject did not mean they were united on all other aspects or beliefs of governance and policy. The Russian people had their own opinions, perspectives, and ideas on how their nation should progress, especially regarding what kind of political system should take place after the fall of autocracy. Some may have leaned towards a democratic or socialist system, while others would have preferred different forms of governance altogether. This diversity in thought and ideas highlights how, despite a shared agreement on the abolishment of autocracy, there were still significant differences among the Russian population, which would undoubtedly have had lasting implications for the nation's political landscape and its future.

Answer:","completion":"Monique Pronk, also known as Monica Maria Pronk, was born on 4th August 1958 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. She is a notable figure in the sport of rowing established in RIC, a renowned sports club in Amsterdam. This indicates her strong association with athletics and local sport organizations, which may have fostered her career. Monique possesses a competitive physique suitable for her sport; she weighs approximately 45 kilograms and stands 1.58 meters tall. These measurements are important considering that in a sport like rowing, a combination of strength, endurance, and agility, achieved through a balanced weight and height, can significantly impact performance. Driven by her passion for rowing, she dedicatedly pursued the sport at her home ground, embedding herself into Amsterdam's robust athletic culture. Even though comparing \\"Monica Maria Pronk\\" and \\"Monique Pronk,\\" suggests that she may have undergone a name change at some point, there remains little doubt about her recognition in the sporting domain of Amsterdam under both identities. In conclusion, Monique Pronk, born in Amsterdam in 1958, serves as an exemplar of passion and discipline in the sport of rowing. She competes with impressive physical credentials and has made valuable contributions to Amsterdam's rich sporting heritage. Why I wrote this: 1. I begin by introducing Monique Pronk, mentioning her full name and alternate name as listed in the facts. This is to clear any confusion if these two names refer to the same individual. Also, and very importantly, I mentioned her birthplace and birthdate to provide basic personal information right at the start. 2. Next, I touched on her career as a rower and her association with the Amsterdam-based sports club, RIC. This helps establish her professional background. 3. Following that, I described her weight and height. Since rowing is a physically demanding sport, it's critical to mention these aspects of her physique to illustrate her fitness for the sport. 4. Lastly, I concluded by summarizing her contributions to the sport and the impact she's had on Amsterdam's sporting scene.

However, the validity of the hypothesis, \\"Look at line 54 at the same time you look at the output and that will tell you where the problem is,\\" cannot be conclusively determined to be true without further information and context. The speaker refers to \\"old computers,\\" indicating that they might be speaking from experience and previously encountered issues related to a specific context or software. The relationship between line 54 and the output might be significant in that specific context, but it may not be universally applicable. To assert the hypothesis as true, we would need to know more about the underlying software, programming language, or system, as well as the nature of the problem being encountered.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

We start by translating each segment of the sentence: \\"Debías\\" (you should have) is translated into \\"היית\\" (hayita) in Hebrew. \\"tener\\" (to have) is not used in this context in Hebrew. \\"un gusto\\" (a liking) is translated to \\"אוהב\\" (ohev) in Hebrew. \\"por lo dramático\\" (for the dramatic) becomes \\"דרמה\\" (drama). \\"y\\" (and) becomes \\"ו\\" (ve). \\"ser\\" (to be) in this context is not used in Hebrew. \\"muy, muy\\" (very, very) is translated to \\"מאוד, מאוד\\" (meod, meod) in Hebrew. \\"rápido\\" (fast) is translated into \\"מהיר\\" (maher) in Hebrew. Step 3: Compose the entire sentence. Combine the translated segments into a sentence: \\"היית צריך להיות אוהב דרמה, ולהיות מאוד, מאוד מהיר\\" Note: Translating between two such different languages inevitably involves some interpretation and rearrangement. There is almost never a perfect word-for-word translation since the grammar and sentence structure rules are dissimilar in Spanish and Hebrew."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? John Gunther and Halldór Laxness, are American? A:","completion":"John Gunther and Halldór Laxness are not American. They come from different national backgrounds and have made significant contributions to their own fields, which has garnered international recognition. To clarify, let's dive deeper into each individual's background, achievements, and nationalities. John Gunther (1901-1970) was an American journalist and author. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States, on August 30, 1901. He gained fame with his \\"Inside\\" books, a series of travelogues that provided readers with a detailed look at political, social, and economic aspects of different countries. His most well-known book, \\"Inside Europe\\" (1936), along with other successful works like \\"Inside Asia\\" (1939) and \\"Inside Africa\\" (1955), solidified his status as a distinguished American journalist, widely recognized for his chronicling of the world events and exploration of diverse cultures. So, in John Gunther's case, your assumption is correct; he is American. On the other hand, Halldór Laxness (1902-1998) was an Icelandic writer and a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was born on April 23, 1902, in Reykjavik, Iceland. He is best known for his novels that delved into the sociopolitical landscape of Iceland and offered deep insights into human nature. His prominent works include \\"Independent People\\" (1934-35), \\"The Atom Station\\" (1948), and \\"World Light\\" (1937-40), among others. In 1955, Halldór Laxness was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his extraordinary and prominent authorship, which has granted him a lasting place in world literature. To clarify, Halldór Laxness is not an American but an Icelandic writer. In conclusion, while John Gunther was an American journalist and author, Halldór Laxness was an Icelandic writer. Although they both made significant contributions to literature and journalism, their nationalities differ, making it clear that not both are American."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Mary decided to candy raspberries, apricots, and apples, and she didn't candy plums, cherries, or pears. The candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma, and tasted delicious. The process of candying fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, involves placing whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel in heated sugar syrup. The syrup absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. This process can take from several days to several months, depending on the fruit's size and type. Candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year, as the fruit becomes saturated with sugar. This sugar saturation prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure it creates. Considering that Mary candied apricots but not cherries, it is the apricots that are saturated with sugar within her selection of fruits. The cherries have not undergone the process of being turned into candied fruit, so they do not have the same sugar saturation or preservation benefits as the apricots, raspberries, and apples that Mary decided to candy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The author expresses immense displeasure and dissatisfaction with the product in question and uses strong language and exclamation marks to emphasize their feelings. There are several indicators in the review highlighting the negativity: 1. The title itself - \\"Disgusting Review\\" This indicates that the author finds the product repulsive and wants to warn others by giving it an extremely unfavorable title. 2. The use of strong negative language Words like \\"WORST,\\" \\"AWFUL,\\" and \\"sick\\" demonstrate the author's distaste for the product and their inability to find any redeeming qualities in it. 3. Personal frustration and emotions The reviewer expresses a desire to \\"smack\\" the girl involved in the product, which exhibits an emotional response of disgust and irritation. 4. Lack of comparison to others The author states that they aren't even comparing the girl's talent to someone else (Amy Lee, in this case) since, in their eyes, the girl possesses no talent at all. 5. Not purchasing the product The reviewer is relieved that they didn't waste their money buying the CD and only listened to the previews. This sentiment further reinforces the review's negative stance, as it shows the author didn't think the product was worth purchasing. 6. The closing statement By ending the review with a declaration of the girl's lack of talent, the author solidifies the negative perspective on the product and leaves a lasting impression on potential buyers.

Article: The barks of dogs surrounded me as I got off the bus. They ran around their cages jumping up and down. My heart became soft at the sight of these poor creatures. I entered the building and discovered more unwanted animals. A white rabbit jumped around in its cage. I walked around the shelter,screaming \\"oh\\" and \\"ah\\" at every animal,as they looked out of their cages,waiting for love and help. A pit bull particularly interested me. She was as gentle as a baby. I slightly touched her head with affection as she sat on the floor. The pit bull licked my hand with appreciation as she cried. A litter of puppies were in the cage opposite the pit bull. They snuggled together for warmth as one of the puppies let out a weak bark,as if calling to its mother. Recognizing my love and willingness to help these puppies,the director suggested I give them a bath. I lifted one of the puppies,Yukie,from his brothers and sisters. His black fur was as soft as cotton candy. I held him tightly. The sweet smell of liquid soap surrounded the wash area. The puppy seemed like a tiny fish,swimming delightedly in a pool. Water dropped down his black,soft ears as he tried to shake off the heavy water. I wrapped Yukie in a towel as he licked my hand. After all the cleaning and drying,he looked as if he'd come from an expensive pet shop. I kissed his little face as I unwillingly placed him back. Next,I walked some dogs around the shelter. They jumped out of their cages,unable to hold back their urge for exercise. I ran around with them,while touching them gently and talking to them. They moved back when the time came to put them back. The time came to leave. I silently promised these creatures to come and again provide them with love. The sad eyes and the faces of these creatures will always be impressed on my memory.

Would \\"Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"While it is true that Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation built on republican lines using federal power, this statement does not answer the specific question of when he was elected president. To provide a detailed and long answer, let's first address the correct answer to the given question: George Washington was elected as the first President of the United States on February 4, 1789. Although he did not want to initially be president, he was urged to accept the role by other founding fathers due to his leadership during the Revolutionary War and his general popularity. Now, let us explain some context to George Washington's vision of a great and powerful nation, which could serve as a supplementary response to the question: Following the Revolutionary War, the newly formed United States struggled to build a cohesive and sustainable government. The Articles of Confederation, the first governing document enacted by the U.S., proved to be insufficient in creating a strong central governing body. Washington, along with other founding fathers such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, recognized the importance of having a more powerful central government in order to maintain unity among the states and protect the nation's interests at home and abroad. This led to the framing of the United States Constitution, which aimed at creating a more efficient federal government that would have a better balance of power among the three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Washington's vision of a great and powerful nation built on republican lines meant that he wanted a government that functioned for the benefit of its citizens, with checks and balances in place to prevent tyranny and provide equal representation. Washington also believed in the importance of federal power, especially when it came to matters such as raising revenue for the country, providing for a national defense, and regulating interstate commerce. He faced numerous challenges throughout his presidency, where he worked diligently to enforce federal power and establish precedents that would be followed by future presidents. For example, the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 showed Washington's commitment to federal authority by suppressing the insurrection using military force, thereby demonstrating the power and authority of the federal government. Furthermore, George Washington was also a proponent of neutrality in foreign affairs, aiming to prevent the United States from being drawn into international conflicts that could hinder its growth and development. In his farewell address, Washington emphasized this stance by advising Americans to steer clear of permanent alliances and to instead focus on nurturing its own growth and prosperity. In conclusion, although the statement \\"Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power\\" accurately represents George Washington's vision for the United States, it is not a direct answer to the question of when he was elected president. The election of George Washington as the first President of the United States took place on February 4, 1789, and his vision for a strong, united, and prosperous nation laid the foundation for the country's continued growth and development over the centuries to follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

DeLay was known to \\"primary\\" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party. Employing a method known as \\"catch and release\\", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power. In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216-215, a vote on Head Start passed 217-216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and \\"Fast track\\", usually called \\"trade promotion authority\\", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as \\"growing the vote\\". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, \\"I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill--at least like they are asking us to whip bills now.\\" His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over 980,000 in total. Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion. On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he \\"offered to endorse Representative [Nick] Smith's son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the Medicare bill.\\" Answer this question \\"Did he have any other methods or tactics?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, DeLay had other methods and tactics. These included: 1. \\"Primarying\\" Republicans who resisted his votes, which involved threatening to endorse and support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative. 2. Using promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among rank-and-file members of the party. 3. Employing a method known as \\"catch and release,\\" which allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. 4.

John Bruce \\"Jack\\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and disbarred attorney, based in Coral Gables, Florida. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson was involved in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore's criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar. For his part, Thompson said he thought the judge was trying to protect Moore's criminal conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website. In the aftermath of this lawsuit, Thompson lobbied Alabama attorney general Troy King to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell \\"cop-killing games\\". After the slaying of another police officer in Gassville, Arkansas by Jacob D. Robida, an 18-year-old fugitive, Thompson again raised the possibility of a connection to Grand Theft Auto, but investigators found no evidence that video games were involved. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what else can you tell me about the case that was interesting?","completion":"One interesting aspect of the case from the article is when it mentions, \\"He [Thompson] also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.\\" This demonstrates Thompson's belief that there was a possible bias in favor of the gaming companies involved in the case and potential unethical conduct on the part of the judge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the R silent? How do I say the German R in brot and frau? It makes no sense and I can't pronounce it. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To address your first question, \\"brot\\" is already a German word, and it translates to \\"bread\\" in English. The R in \\"brot\\" is not silent. For your second question, the German 'R' in \\"brot\\" and \\"frau\\" has a unique pronunciation that can be challenging for non-native speakers. Here is a step-by-step explanation for pronouncing the German 'R': 1. Relax your tongue, and keep it flat at the bottom of your mouth. 2. Push the back part of your tongue towards the uvula (the small, fleshy projection hanging from the back of the soft palate), without touching it. 3. To produce the 'R' sound, gently constrict air by narrowing the passage between the back of your tongue and your uvula while exhaling. 4. For \\"brot,\\" the 'R' comes after the initial 'B,' so you'll need to make a smooth transition from the 'B' sound to the German 'R' sound I described. 5. For \\"frau,\\" follow a similar approach, moving from the 'F' sound to the German 'R' sound, followed by the 'AU' diphthong. Your third question asks if the first two questions are paraphrases of each other. No, they are not exact paraphrases, as they address different aspects. The first question asks how to say \\"brot\\" in German and whether the R is silent, while the second question specifically asks for pronunciation guidance on the German 'R' in \\"brot\\" and \\"frau\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: How can I drain browned beef?","completion":"Draining browned beef is an essential step in many recipes, as it helps to remove excess fat and grease, which can lead to health problems and negatively impact the flavor and texture of your dish. Below, you'll find a detailed, step-by-step guide on the best way to drain browned beef. 1. Gather necessary tools and materials: To properly drain browned beef, make sure you have the following items on hand: a. A large skillet or pan b. A slotted spoon or spatula c. A large heat-safe bowl or container d. A colander or mesh sieve e. A couple of layers of paper towels or a heat-safe plate 2. Cook the beef: Begin by cooking the ground beef in the skillet or pan over medium heat until it is browned and no longer pink. Make sure to break up the beef into small, bite-sized pieces using the slotted spoon or spatula, and to stir the meat frequently to ensure even browning. 3. Turn off the heat: Once the beef is fully cooked, turn off the heat and allow the beef to sit in the skillet for a minute or two. This will give the beef a chance to cool slightly, which can make it easier and safer to handle during the draining process. 4. Transfer the beef using a slotted spoon: Using a slotted spoon or spatula, transfer the cooked beef from the skillet to the colander or mesh sieve, which should be placed over the heat-safe bowl or container. The slotted spoon will help separate the meat from the excess fat and grease. 5. Allow the beef to drain: Let the beef sit in the colander or mesh sieve for a few minutes to allow the excess fat and grease to drain into the bowl or container below. You can also gently shake the colander or press down on the beef with the slotted spoon or spatula to help encourage the draining process. 6. Pat the beef with paper towels (optional): If you want to remove even more excess fat and grease, you can place the drained beef on a couple of layers of paper towels or a heat-safe plate. Gently pat the beef with additional paper towels to absorb any remaining fat. Be careful not to press too hard, as this could cause the beef to crumble. 7. Discard the excess fat: After the beef has been properly drained, carefully dispose of the collected fat and grease. Avoid pouring the fat down your sink, as it can lead to clogged pipes. Instead, allow the fat to cool and solidify in the bowl or container, then spoon it into a sealable plastic bag and discard it in the trash. 8. Return the beef to the skillet: Now that your beef is drained, you can return it to the skillet for further cooking, if your recipe calls for additional ingredients or steps. If not, you can transfer the drained beef to a serving dish or storage container. By following these steps, you'll effectively drain the excess fat and grease from your browned beef, resulting in a healthier, more flavorful meal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

North's agent has revealed that Scarlets are in talks with the Saints. Davies says the Welsh regions are almost admitting they are just breeding grounds for Europe's top clubs. \\"If we're going to be nurseries then we are almost throwing the towel in on the domestic front,\\" he said. \\"If we want to compete, let's do so. If we don't, let's say so and not lead anybody up the garden path.\\" North, 20, has a year left on his Scarlets contract and is not actively seeking a transfer, according to his agent. But Christian Abt claims the region, who have refused to comment, have been talking to the Saints and \\"possibly a few other parties\\" about North's future. He says the financial difficulties facing the Welsh regions are a factor in the North talks. Scarlets, like the three other Welsh regions, are struggling financially and will be operating under a self-imposed £3.5m salary cap next season. They recouped an undisclosed fee after allowing Ben Morgan to join Gloucester at the end of last season, and would expect to pocket a significant amount for North, who is rated as one of world rugby's most destructive wingers. Should he move, North would join fellow Wales stars Jamie Roberts and Dan Lydiate in leaving the domestic game at the end of the season. Alex Cuthbert has bucked the recent trend by extending his contract with Cardiff Blues, who have also tempted Gethin Jenkins back from Toulon. But a steady trickle of Wales players have been lost in recent seasons, lured by the offer of significantly higher wages in England and France. \\"Finances are obviously coming into play here, probably on both sides,\\" added Davies, a former chief executive of Cardiff RFC. \\"It's no secret that all the Welsh regions are struggling financially so if the Scarlets can secure a healthy return for [Saints] buying North's contract out, it's obviously of appeal to them. \\"And of course in terms of George North securing his own future, if a club like Northampton comes in and doubles or triples his salary then he's obviously going to look after his own welfare. \\"I don't think we can attribute blame on anybody - it's a commercial reality these days.\\" But Davies does fear that while Wales are flourishing on the international stage, having just clinched the Six Nations title for the fourth time in nine years, the domestic game is being left behind. No Welsh team reached this season's quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition, the Heineken Cup, and all four regions have called for greater financial support from the Welsh Rugby Union. \\"We're almost saying as a nation that we can't or don't want to compete on the domestic front,\\" said Davies. \\"I find that quite sad. Welsh rugby should make a statement that we want to compete with the best in Europe. \\"It's fine at Six Nations level - that's very important as we've seen in recent weeks - but there are still 30 other weekends in the season when I'm sure Welsh rugby supporters would love to see the Welsh regions competing with the top French and English clubs.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This is a story about a rugby player named North. His team, Scarlets, is talking to another team called Saints about his future. The man named Davies is worried that Welsh rugby teams like Scarlets are becoming a place where young players learn before they go to bigger teams in Europe. He wants Welsh rugby teams to compete with the best teams in Europe, but they don't have enough money. Many good players from Wales have left to play in England and France for more money. Davies believes this is a problem for Welsh teams and their fans."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream - Unused materials passed into large intestine to become fecal matter. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process in the digestion of food begins with ingestion, which involves taking food into the mouth. Here, the food is mechanically broken down into smaller pieces by the process of mastication or chewing. During this process, enzymes in the saliva, particularly amylase, initiate the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates in the food. As the teeth grind and tear the food, the tongue helps to mix and manipulate it, rolling it into a round mass known as a bolus. The saliva not only helps soften and moisten the food for easier swallowing, but it also begins the chemical breakdown of the food. After the food has been sufficiently broken down, it is swallowed and passes through the pharynx, the common passageway for both food and air. The act of swallowing is a well-coordinated mechanism that involves the tongue and several muscles in the throat, which work together to push the food bolus down the esophagus. This movement is facilitated by a wave-like muscle contraction called peristalsis, which propels the food down the esophagus and into the stomach. This marks the beginning of the complex journey of the food through the different parts of the digestive system, as detailed in the sequence provided. Throughout this journey, the food is progressively broken down and its nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream, while the undigested materials are eventually expelled as fecal matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Renee Rebecca Geyer (born 11 September 1953, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) is an Australian singer who has long been regarded as one of the finest exponents of jazz, soul and R&B idioms. She had commercial success as a solo artist in Australia, with \\"It's a Man's Man's World\\", \\"Heading in the Right Direction\\" and \\"Stares and Whispers\\" in the 1970s and \\"Say I Love You\\" in the 1980s. Geyer has also been an internationally respected and sought-after backing vocalist, whose session credits include work with Sting, Chaka Khan, Toni Childs and Joe Cocker. In 2000, her autobiography, Confessions of a Difficult Woman, co-written with music journalist Ed Nimmervoll, was published. Geyer visited Australia in 1992 and recorded a number of songs, including \\"Foggy Highway\\", for the ABC-TV mini series Seven Deadly Sins, alongside Vika Bull, Deborah Conway and Paul Kelly. The album was released in February 1993 and peaked at number 71 on the ARIA Charts. Two singles were released from the soundtrack including Geyer's cover of Willie Nelson's \\"Crazy\\". Kelly produced Geyer's ninth studio album Difficult Woman which was released on Larrikin Records in 1994. It was her first solo studio album in 9 years. The exposure encouraged Geyer to move back to Australia and following the release of Difficult Woman, Geyer spent time reestablishing herself on the live circuit across Australia. These performances showed her more relaxed on stage than at her peak when her innate shyness was often cleverly disguised. Now a confident, mature woman she showed off a hitherto hidden wicked sense of humour. In May 1998, Mushroom Records released The Best of Renee Geyer 1973-1998, which peaked at number 50 in New Zealand and 53 in Australia. The album was released with a bonus disc of remixed tracks including her 1981 single \\"Say I Love You\\" which was released as the lead single by GROOVE 21/20 featuring Geyer. Also in 1998, Geyer recorded \\"Yil Lull\\" alongside Kelly, Archie Roach, Christine Anu, Judith Durham, Kutcha Edwards and Tiddas. In March 1999, Geyer release her tenth studio album Sweet Life. The album was again produced by Kelly and Joe Camilleri (Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons, The Black Sorrows). The album peaked at number 50 in the ARIA Charts.

To understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's analyze them individually. Premise: \\"I don't know, I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around.\\" This statement indicates that the speaker is unsure about something, possibly related to the recipe. They express interest in obtaining the recipe for someone else if they have access to it. Their interest lies in being helpful towards the other person.

However, they seem to be expressing that they would unlikely use the recipe themselves. In this case, their interest might come from curiosity or simply wanting to know the recipe but not necessarily for personal use. Based on the information provided above, it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise shows an interest in obtaining the recipe to assist someone else, while the hypothesis expresses interest in knowing the recipe but not using it personally.

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\". - Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff - nesting swallows . The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow , and contains the following species : - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.

Defensive Counterair (DCA) is defined as \\"all the defensive measures designed to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy or negate enemy forces attempting to penetrate or attack through friendly airspace\\" (JP 1-02). A major goal of DCA operations, in concert with OCA operations, is to provide an area from which forces can operate, secure from air and missile threats. The DCA mission comprises both active and passive defense measures. Active defense is \\"the employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy\\" (JP 1-02). It includes both ballistic missile defense and air breathing threat defense, and encompasses point defense, area defense, and high value airborne asset defense. Passive defense is \\"measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative\\" (JP 1-02). It includes detection and warning; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense; camouflage, concealment, and deception; hardening; reconstitution; dispersion; redundancy; and mobility, counter-measures, and stealth. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What kind of missile defense does active defense protect against, according to the DCA?","completion":"According to the Defensive Counterair (DCA) definition, active defense is a component of DCA operations that focuses on employing limited offensive actions and counterattacks to protect against enemy forces attempting to penetrate or attack friendly airspace. While the definition does not explicitly mention the specific types of missile defense active defense protects against, it generally covers both ballistic missile defense and air-breathing threat defense. Ballistic missile defense refers to the protection against missile threats that follow a ballistic trajectory - that is, a trajectory defined by gravity and typically used by intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), short, medium or intermediate-range ballistic missiles. These missiles can carry a variety of payloads, including conventional and nuclear warheads. Ballistic missile defense systems aim to detect, track, intercept, and destroy such incoming missiles before they reach their intended targets. Air-breathing threat defense, on the other hand, focuses on the protection against airborne threats that rely on the atmosphere to operate, such as cruise missiles, manned aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. These threats have different characteristics and capabilities compared to ballistic missiles, thus requiring tailored defensive measures for effective protection. In summary, active defense in DCA operations provides protection against a variety of missile threats, including ballistic missiles and air-breathing threats. The combination of these defensive measures aims to ensure that friendly airspace remains secure and that forces can operate effectively and safely."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he...

Context: Zoos are not my favorite places. I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Article: Eight-year-old Jesse Abrogate was playing in the sea late one evening in July 2001 when a 7-foot bull shark attacked him and tore off his arm. Jesse's uncle jumped into the sea and dragged the boy to the store. The boy was not breathing. His aunt gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while his uncle rang the emergency services. Pretty soon, a helicopter arrived and flew the boy to hospital. It was a much quicker journey than the journey by road. Jesse's uncle, Vance Folsenzier, ran back into the sea and found the shark that had attacked his nephew. He picked the shark up and threw it onto the beach. A coastguard shot the fish four times and although this didn't kill it, the shark's jaws relaxed so that they could open them, and reach down onto its stomach, and pull out the boy's arm. At the Baptist hospital in Pensacola, Dr Lan Rogers spent eleven hours reattaching Jesse's arm. \\"It was a complicated operation,\\" he said, \\"but we were lucky. If the arm hadn't been recovered in time, we wouldn't have been able to do the operation at all. What I means is that if they hadn't found the shark, well then we wouldn't have had a chance.\\" According to local park ranger Jack Tomosvic, shark attacks are not that common. \\"Jesse was just unlucky\\" he says, \\"Evening is the shark's feeding time. And Jesse was in the area without lifeguards. This would never have happened if he had been in the area where swimming is allowed.\\" When reporters asked Jesse's uncle how he had had the courage to fight a shark , he replied, \\"I was mad and you do some strange things when you're mad.\\" Question: How was his uncle in time of danger ?

A man who allegedly was with Aaron Hernandez the night Odin Lloyd was killed pleaded not guilty Friday to a single count of being an accessory to murder after the fact. As members of his and Lloyd's family looked on, Carlos Ortiz uttered only those two words -- \\"not guilty\\" -- during his brief arraignment in Bristol County Superior Court in the southeastern Massachusetts city of Fall River. His next court date is set for November 20. Ortiz is one of several people who have been charged in connection with Lloyd's death, though only one person -- Hernandez, who was a standout tight end for the New England Patriots before being released by the team the day of his arrest -- faces a murder count. Like Hernandez, Ortiz hails from Bristol, Connecticut. During Friday's court hearing, Ortiz's lawyer John Connors did not contest the 500,000 cash bail set for his client, though he could do so later. \\"We don't have the grand jury minutes, we don't have a lot of the discovery statements, etc. So I think it's prudent to wait for the next date until we argue (bail),\\" Connors said. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Ortiz picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death June 17 in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. Question: \\"Who arrived after the Celts and Iberians?\\" Response: \\"The Romans\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 2007 Yehuda David, a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv, told Israel's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries. Walden listed \\"a gunshot wound in the right wrist, a shattered forearm bone, multiple fragment wounds in a palm, gunshot wounds in the right thigh, a fractured pelvis, an exit wound in the buttocks, a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh, tears in the main groin arteries and veins, and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg.\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first name of the person that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, called to congratulate is Yehuda.

Step 1: Evaluate the context The sentence tells us that James spills some oil on the floor, and as a result, he puts a mat over it. The reason for putting the mat has to be related to the spilled oil. Step 2: Analyze the options Option 1 - Floor is slippery: If there is oil spilled on the floor, it will make the floor slippery, which can pose a hazard. Option 2 - Mat is slippery: This option suggests that the mat itself is slippery. However, it doesn't relate to the oil spill, which is the main cause mentioned in the sentence. Step 3: Select the appropriate option In this case, the logical option that connects with the context of the sentence is Option 1, as it directly addresses the oil spill and provides a reason for James to put a mat over it.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] and the situation: Nigeria invested in sand mining and started mining coastal barriers. Congo continued preserving their picturesque beaches. Answer the following question: Which country caused less turbidity in the coastal water? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation described, Congo caused less turbidity in the coastal water. Congo continued preserving their picturesque beaches and did not engage in sand mining activities. In contrast, Nigeria invested in sand mining and started mining coastal barriers, which is known to cause disturbance of underwater and coastal sand. This disturbance leads to turbidity in the water, which is harmful to various marine organisms like coral that need sunlight for survival. By not engaging in sand mining, Congo contributed to maintaining a clearer, less turbid coastal water environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pick from: (A). neutrons; (B). protons; (C). isotopes; (D). electrons; Q: Electronegativity is a qualitative measure of how much an atom attracts what in a covalent bond? A: Answer:","completion":"Electronegativity is a qualitative measure of how much an atom attracts electrons in a covalent bond. In this context, the correct answer is (D) electrons. Electronegativity is a fundamental concept in the study of chemistry, particularly in understanding the nature of covalent bonds and predicting the reactivity of elements in various chemical reactions. It was first introduced by Linus Pauling in 1932. Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons to fill their outer shells in an attempt to achieve a stable electronic configuration. When two atoms participate in the formation of a covalent bond, they both contribute electrons to the shared pair. However, not all atoms have the same tendency to attract the shared electrons. Electronegativity is the measure of an atom's ability to attract the bonding pair of electrons towards itself. The greater an atom's electronegativity, the stronger its pull on the shared electrons. Electronegativity varies across the periodic table; it tends to increase from left to right across a period and decrease as you move down a group. This variation in electronegativity can have significant effects on the properties of the covalent bond between two atoms. If the electronegativity values of the involved atoms are equal or very close, the shared electrons are equally distributed between the bonded atoms, resulting in a non-polar covalent bond. If there is a significant difference in electronegativity values, the electrons spend more time near the more electronegative atom, and less time near the less electronegative atom, resulting in a polar covalent bond. In some extreme cases, a large electronegativity difference between two atoms may lead to complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another instead of sharing, resulting in the formation of an ionic bond rather than a covalent bond. To summarize, electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a covalent bond, and it helps to explain the polar or non-polar nature of these bonds, as well as chemical reactivity and the formation of ionic or covalent bonds between different elements. The correct answer to the given question is (D) electrons."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The Canadian football field is 150 yards (137 m) long and 65 yards (59 m) wide with end zones 20 yards (18 m) deep, and goal lines 110 yards (101 m) apart. At each goal line is a set of 40-foot-high (12 m) goalposts, which consist of two uprights joined by an 18 1⁄2-foot-long (5.6 m) crossbar which is 10 feet (3 m) above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts 10 feet (3 m) above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every 5 yards (4.6 m) from the goal line. These lateral lines are called \\"yard lines\\" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows were not used and every yard line was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with a \\"0\\"; in most stadiums today, the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-yard lines are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a \\"G\\".

News article: Obama Unveils Proposals for Toughening Laws on Guns Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Children who wrote President Obama seeking curbs on guns after the Newtown school shooting were invited to Wednesdayâs news conference at the White House. WASHINGTON — Four days before taking the oath of office, President Obama on Wednesday staked the beginning of his second term on an uphill quest to pass the broadest gun control legislation in a generation. In the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre, Mr. Obama vowed to rally public opinion to press a reluctant Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expand background checks, and toughen gun-trafficking laws. Recognizing that the legislative fight could be long and difficult, the president also took immediate steps by issuing a series of executive actions intended to reduce gun violence. Surrounded by children who wrote him letters seeking curbs on guns, Mr. Obama committed himself to a high-profile and politically volatile campaign behind proposals assembled by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that will test the administration’s strength heading into the next four years. The first big push of Mr. Obama’s second term, then, will come on an issue that was not even on his to-do list on Election Day when voters renewed his lease on the presidency. “I will put everything I’ve got into this,” Mr. Obama said, “and so will Joe.” The emotionally charged ceremony, attended by family members of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., reflected a decision by the White House to seize on public outrage to challenge the political power of the National Rifle Association and other forces that have successfully fought new gun laws for decades. The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president’s plan. “I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,” Mr. Obama said. “And, by the way, that doesn’t just mean from certain parts of the country. We’re going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can’t just be the usual suspects.” The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president’s speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an “elitist hypocrite” for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president’s other proposals. “Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,” the N.R.A. said in a statement. “Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.” Mr. Obama’s plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation’s database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns. Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama’s plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system. He also proposed legislation banning the possession or transfer of armor-piercing bullets and cracking down on “straw purchasers,” those who pass background checks and then forward guns to criminals or others forbidden from purchasing them. For Mr. Obama, the plan represented a political pivot. While he has always expressed support for an assault weapons ban, he has made no real effort to pass it on the assumption that the votes were not there. But he and the White House are banking on the idea that the Newtown shooting has changed the dynamics. “I have never seen the nation’s conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday. “The world has changed and is demanding action.” Reporting was contributed by Charlie Savage, Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Weisman. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article suggested that several recent mass shootings involved 30-round magazines. While they all involved high-capacity clips, not all of them used clips that held 30 rounds.

Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how do cucumbers come from flowers?\\" is \\"fertilization occurs\\", given that cucumber flowers are pollinated by insects to create cucumbers? Answer:","completion":"Yes, I believe that \\"fertilization occurs\\" is the right answer to the question \\"how do cucumbers come from flowers?\\", but it's essential to provide a more in-depth explanation to clarify the process. The growth of a cucumber begins with the fertilization of the flower, which is a fundamental step in the life cycle of most flowering plants. This process is essential for the formation and development of the cucumbers that we consume. Let's examine the steps of this process more thoroughly: 1. Flowering: Cucumber plants produce flowers, which contain male and female organs, in separate flowers. Male flowers typically appear first and in larger numbers, followed by females flowers that have a tiny ovary or immature cucumber at their base. 2. Pollination: Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male to female flower, which is necessary for fertilization to occur. In cucumbers, this process generally requires the help of external agents, such as insects (especially bees). The pollen from the male stamen is carried by pollinators to the female stigma. In some cases, hand pollination is also carried out to ensure proper transfer of pollen, particularly in greenhouses where natural pollinators may not be present. 3. Fertilization: Once the pollen has been successfully transferred from the male to the female flower, fertilization occurs. The pollen grain germinates and forms a pollen tube that extends into the ovary of the female flower. The sperm nuclei from the pollen grain then move down the pollen tube and into the ovary, where they fuse with the egg and form a zygote. This process marks the completion of fertilization. 4. Fruit development: After fertilization, the zygote starts to divide and develop into an embryo, which prompts the transformation of the ovary into a fruit. In the case of cucumbers, the ovary enlarges and develops into the cucumber fruit we commonly consume. The process of fruit growth also includes the development and maturation of the seeds inside the cucumber. 5. Harvesting: Cucumbers are typically harvested based on their intended use, size, and degree of ripeness. The period between pollination and harvest ranges from 45 to 60 days, depending on the specific variety and growing conditions. In conclusion, the statement \\"fertilization occurs\\" is indeed the right answer to the question \\"how do cucumbers come from flowers?\\" because it emphasizes the pivotal role of fertilization in the production of cucumber fruits. However, it's essential to delve into the details of this complex process and understand the nuances of flowering, pollination, fertilization, fruit development, and harvesting, which together guarantee the growth of cucumbers from flowers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alan Partridge: a guide for Americans, newcomers and American newcomers If you’re an American movie lover, you’ll find yourself flooded with choices this weekend. It’s your first chance to see the Captain America sequel, Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin and the second part of Nymphomaniac. But the film you should watch, despite it not featuring nudity and/or Scarlett Johansson, is Alan Partridge. Understandably, you might be a little put off by this idea. It’s not as big as the others. It hasn’t wowed as many festival juries. To you it may be an obscure foreign comedy, almost entirely set within a single building, featuring a little-known character played by the guy from Hamlet 2. But avoiding it would be a grave error on your part. Alan Partridge is one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades. Perhaps an explanatory glossary would help. The key cultural touchstone to understanding Alan Partridge. A longtime fan – to the extent that he named his own son Fernando – Partridge’s big break on television came as the host of a talk show named after Abba’s song Knowing Me, Knowing You. Although his love for Abba is also the root of his infamous catchphrase \\"Aha\\", it by no means mark the limits of his musical knowledge. He has been known to describe Wings as \\"the band the Beatles could have been\\", and has a freakish understanding of the subtleties of Roachford’s 1988 UK number four hit Cuddly Toy. He has also been known to play a mean air bass. The original UK title for Alan Partridge, based on his Nato phonetic alphabet initials. It’s a better title than Alan Partridge, but we ruined The Avengers by calling it Avengers Assemble, so let’s call it a truce. Alan’s first job in broadcasting was as the sports correspondent on the early 1990s news programme The Day Today. Alan quickly established himself as an exuberant commentator, especially during the 1994 World Cup where he marked goals with joyous cries of “Twat!” and “Shit!” A docu-soap following the lean times that came after his talkshow years. Divorced and living in a roadside hotel, I'm Alan Partridge saw Alan try to claw his way back to respectability by presenting the evening show on Radio Norwich and hosting the military-themed game show Skirmish on digital channel UK Conquest. He would then suffer a mental breakdown and drive to Dundee in his bare feet before eventually embarking on a short-lived love affair with a disturbed Ukrainian woman named Sonja. Alan Partridge’s talk show. Plagued by disaster from the outset, barely an episode would pass without incident. The show was taken off air after episode six, where he accidentally shot a guest dead during a broadcast. Alan’s attempt at a comeback, a one-off festive edition entitled Knowing Me, Knowing Yule, effectively marked the end of his career as a major broadcaster when he punched both a disabled man and the BBC’s director of programming in the face with a roast partridge. Alan’s favourite combination of beverages: a pint of lager with chasers of Baileys and gin and tonic. Partridge’s current job. He hosts a daytime show on a small, online-only, ultra-local radio station. Despite occasional signs to the contrary, Alan finally seems to have found peace with his life at the station. Alan Partridge’s home town. His love for Norwich is unparalleled. Even during his glory days in London, he’d still find the time to remind viewers of his roots. He’d return to Norwich with the late-period documentary special Welcome to the Places of my Life. In return, the people of Norwich repaid his kindness by illuminating the city with a giant festive effigy of his face, complete with laser-firing eyes. It is no less than he deserves. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Alan Partridge is a beloved British comic character who has had various TV shows, a movie, and radio programs that follow his journey as a broadcaster.

Article: Karl Fleming joined the military because he needed a change in his life. He had a successful career with a shipping company but he wanted to do something more. He found that something in the U.S. army. Fleming began his service in 2009 and never looked back. A few years later, Fleming volunteered to go to Afghanistan. There, he worked as a bodyguard for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He enjoyed it, except for the almost-nightly rocket attacks. Karl was never hit directly by a rocket, but he didn't need to be to feel its effects. The rockets caused severe shaking, shaking so bad that Fleming was left with many injuries. He was also diagnosed with concussions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). Fleming said he was down but not out. Once he returned from Afghanistan, Fleming underwent one test after another. At first, Fleming said he thought he could recover or be able to return to duty and realize his dream of becoming an officer. But then came the news he had never imagined: Fleming would never be an officer because he was too injured to continue. Fleming said he was depressed after learning his military career was over. Add that to the memory loss, extreme anxiety and the many painful medical procedures he was already experiencing. He rarely ventured outside on the weekend. Instead, he preferred to sleep in. All that changed, however, with Fleming's service dog, Kuchar. Fleming said he had heard dogs could help people suffering from PTSD, so he started doing research. Karl eventually selected K9s for Warriors, which is where he met Kuchar, a yellow lab. Fleming and Kuchar trained together for weeks, before returning to Fort Benning. K9s for Warriors provided Fleming with Kuchar and the training for free. Life with Kuchar has been life-changing. Fleming doesn't sleep in any more because Kuchar won't let him. Instead, they venture out into a world Karl was once afraid of -- a world for Fleming that now seems impossible to imagine without Kuchar by his side.

Write an article with the title: \\"Debbie Harry: From Blondie to Golden Girl\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Debbie Harry: From Blondie to Golden Girl Introduction Debbie Harry, the leading lady of the iconic band Blondie, is an artist whose journey has taken her from punk rock stardom to a status akin to that of a golden girl in the music sphere. With a career spanning over five decades, Harry has remained a consistent force in pop culture, as well as a role model for aspiring musicians and independent women everywhere. Early Years and the Formation of Blondie Born in Miami, Florida in 1945 and later adopted by a couple in New Jersey, Debbie Harry had a relatively ordinary childhood. She attended Hawthorne High School, where she started experimenting with music and took part in her school choir. After completing high school, Harry enrolled in Centenary College to study art, and it was during her time here that she began to truly fall in love with music and performing. Harry moved to New York City in the late 60s, where she worked as a secretary, a waitress, and even a Playboy bunny before pursuing music full-time. She performed in several local bands including The Wind in the Willows and The Stilettos, where she met future boyfriend and Blondie co-founder, Chris Stein. In 1974, Blondie was born. The band, which initially played at the infamous CBGB club in Manhattan's Lower East Side, quickly gained popularity due to their unique sound, which fused punk with new wave and pop melodies. Harry's distinctive voice, as well as her striking beauty and unapologetically bold stage presence, would soon help propel the band - and Harry as an icon - to international fame. Blondie's Rise to Fame Blondie released their debut, self-titled album in 1976, and followed it up with \\"Plastic Letters\\" in 1977, which featured hits such as \\"Denis\\" and \\"(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear.\\" However, it was their third album, \\"Parallel Lines,\\" released in 1978, which solidified Blondie's place in music history. The album produced hits like \\"Hanging on the Telephone,\\" \\"One Way or Another,\\" and the unforgettable \\"Heart of Glass,\\" with the latter garnering the band their first US number one single. The blend of punk, new wave, and disco that defined Blondie's music set them apart from other bands of their era, and Harry's charisma and powerful stage presence made her a beloved figure in the world of rock and pop. The band continued to release successful albums like \\"Eat to the Beat\\" (1979) and \\"Autoamerican\\" (1980), which featured the hit songs \\"Dreaming,\\" \\"The Tide is High,\\" and \\"Rapture,\\" the latter making history as the first-ever rap-influenced song to top the Billboard chart. Solo Career and Acting Ventures While the band took a hiatus in the 1980s, Debbie Harry embarked on a solo career. Her debut, \\"KooKoo\\" (1981), was a moderate success bolstered by striking, avant-garde visuals. She went on to release three more solo albums: \\"Rockbird\\" (1986), \\"Def, Dumb & Blonde\\" (1989), and \\"Debravation\\" (1993), all showcasing her versatility as an artist. Throughout her career, Harry has also dabbled in acting, starring in films such as \\"Videodrome\\" (1983), \\"Hairspray\\" (1988) and \\"Heavy\\" (1995). Her desire to explore various creative endeavors smoothly propelled her growth as a well-rounded performer. Blondie's Reunion and Legacy Blondie reunited in 1997 and released \\"No Exit\\" in 1999, featuring the hit single \\"Maria.\\" Since then, the band - with Debbie Harry at the helm - has continued to produce music and tour, releasing four more albums, including \\"Pollinator\\" (2017), which saw collaborations with contemporary artists like Sia, Dev Hynes, and Johnny Marr. Today, Debbie Harry's lasting impact on the music industry is undeniable. As the charismatic frontwoman of Blondie, she broke boundaries in a male-dominated rock scene while incorporating elements of punk, disco, and hip-hop that transcended genres, ultimately influencing generations of musicians that followed. From her iconic punk-rock beginnings to her status as a golden girl in the music world, Debbie Harry's voice, style, and legacy continue to inspire and captivate audiences all around the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Context: Cameron is being chased by the police and climbed the fence quickly with little regard for their own safety. Question: Why did Cameron do this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: enjoys climbing over fences B: keep running C: wanted to get away Answer:","completion":"C: wanted to get away Given the provided context, it is clear that Cameron is in a situation where they are being chased by the police. The pursuit implies that Cameron has likely committed or is suspected of committing some form of illegal activity, or is in a situation where they are attempting to avoid confrontation with the police. As a result, the most logical reason for Cameron's actions is to create distance and evade law enforcement in order to avoid the consequences of being captured. Option A: enjoys climbing over fences - This answer does not take into account the context of the situation. While it is possible that Cameron could enjoy climbing fences, it is highly unlikely that this is the primary motivation for their actions while being pursued by the police. The stress of the situation and the desire to escape would outweigh any enjoyment that might be derived from climbing fences. Option B: keep running - This answer does not directly address the question as to why Cameron is choosing to climb the fence. While it is true that climbing the fence is part of Cameron's forward movement to keep running, it does not explain the motivation behind their decision to do so during the police chase. Option C: wanted to get away - This answer aligns most closely with the context of the situation. Given that Cameron is being chased by the police, it can be inferred that they are trying to evade capture and the potential consequences that come with it. The act of climbing the fence quickly and with little regard for their own safety shows a sense of urgency to escape, indicating a strong desire to get away from the police and the situation as fast as possible. In conclusion, based on the context of Cameron being chased by the police, the answer that best explains why they climbed the fence quickly with little regard for their own safety is Option C: wanted to get away. This answer takes into account the pursuit by law enforcement and the potentially dire consequences Cameron faces should they be captured, thus providing a clear and logical explanation for their actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the full name of the person that restricted her appearance on the show to only Tuesdays? Answer the above question based on the context below: Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of 250 awarded in 1949.

Next question: tissue that develops into a protective seed coat surrounding the embryo?","completion":"The tissue that develops into the protective seed coat, which surrounds the embryo in a seed, is known as the integument. It plays a crucial role in the process of seed development and plant reproduction. The integument is derived from the maternal parent plant and subsequently transformed into the seed coat during the process of fertilization. To help understand this process, it's essential to describe the different parts of a seed: 1. Embryo: The future plant that develops from the fusion of the male and female gametes (sperm and egg cells). 2. Endosperm: The tissue that provides nutrients to the growing embryo. 3. Seed coat: A protective layer that encloses the embryo and endosperm, preserving them and often facilitating dispersal. The integument originates as part of the ovule, which is the female reproductive structure of the plant. The ovule comprises two essential components: the nucellus, which contains the embryo sac with the egg cell, and the integuments, which enclose the nucellus. The integuments can be divided into two layers: 1. Outer integument: The external protective layer. 2. Inner integument: The layer between the outer integument and the nucellus. The process of seed formation involves pollination, fertilization, and seed development: 1. Pollination: Pollen grains from a male flower's anther travel to the female flower's stigma, often through wind or animal intervention (such as insects, birds, or bats). Pollen tubes germinate and grow down the style to reach the ovary and the ovules within. 2. Fertilization: The sperm nuclei from the pollen grain travel through the pollen tube and enter the embryo sac within the ovule, where it fuses with the egg cell, creating a zygote. Additionally, a sperm nucleus fuses with two polar nuclei within the embryo sac to form the triploid endosperm. 3. Seed development: The zygote undergoes several rounds of cell division to form the embryo. As the embryo grows, the endosperm-stockpiles nutrients, the nucellus degenerates, and the integuments differentiate and harden to form the seed coat. The seed is now complete, and the surrounding ovule matures into a carpel or fruit, which will protect and disperse the seeds. To summarize, the integument is the tissue that develops into the protective seed coat surrounding the embryo. It is one of the essential components of the ovule and plays a vital role in seed development and plant reproduction. The seed coat safeguards the embryo and endosperm and often contributes to the dispersal mechanisms of plant species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There were 144 prosecutions in London. One electrician, who admitted rigging meters, told the BBC poverty was the main reason people sought his services. Police said the regional variation in prosecutions reflected enforcement effort rather than actual thefts. The figures, released to BBC Essex by the Crown Prosecution Service under freedom of information laws, also showed Merseyside had seen the largest three-year increase in prosecution numbers. In 2012-13 there were 112 cases in Merseyside, followed by 202 the following year and up to 267 in 2014-15. Liverpool Citizens Advice Bureau did not respond to the BBC's questions about whether it had seen a rise in cases of people concerned about utility bills. But a spokeswoman for Merseyside Police said the high levels of cases reflected its close working with electricity companies and \\"pro-active policing\\". She said the force had done a \\"lot of work\\" targeting cannabis farms, which had been found to be stealing electricity as well as growing the class B drug. During a raid five weeks ago in north Liverpool, officers found 200 cannabis plants and the electricity illegally bypassed. Insp Sarah Jones said the mix of electricity tampering and extensive watering systems were a dangerous combination and accounted for a growing number of fires in the area. \\"The people who set up these farms often tamper with electricity meters to steal electricity,\\" she said. \\"And there will generally be a number of hot lamps which can overload electricity sockets, which can be running alongside extensive watering systems.\\" The north west region had 619 court cases in total - more than the North East, Yorkshire and Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands and the East of England combined. Areas with the smallest number of prosecutions were North Yorkshire and Northamptonshire (four), Dorset (three) and Wiltshire (one). One electrician, who spoke to BBC Essex on condition of anonymity, admitted tampering with about 20 meters and said he knew of other electricians and gas engineers who did the same. Asked who he had rigged meters for, the electrician said: \\"They're all from different backgrounds. Mainly it's just people with no money. \\"It has been single parents, people with with kids that are, I mean, in sort of poor quality housing that haemorrhage heat, a couple of old people - just all different people. Just people with no money. \\"In my book they have as much right to be warm in the winter as anyone else. I wouldn't do it for someone doing it just out of greed.\\" It is understood some electricians charge as little as Â£50 to illegally rig a meter. Alan Wells, of the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting, said risks included electric shocks and fires. He said he was disappointed to learn some qualified electricians were carrying out illegal work. Roger Critchell, director of operations for Crimestoppers, said: \\"This is not the victimless crime that some may perceive it to be. \\"And not only is it highly dangerous, it also has very real links to serious and organised crime.\\" Summary:","completion":"Newly released figures from the Crown Prosecution Service reveal that utility energy theft has reached record levels in the UK.

The defining symptom is a itchy skin reaction resulting from contact with water, regardless of its temperature. It is sometimes described as an allergy, although it is not a true histamine-releasing allergic reaction like other forms of urticaria. This seems to not be affected by different temperatures of water, such as cold or hot, or chemicals such as fluorine and chlorine, since it is reproduced with distilled water and medical saline. What's the best answer to this question: is there such a thing as being allergic to water? Possible answers: -- no; -- yes;...A:","completion":"Yes, there is such a thing as being \\"allergic\\" to water, although it is important to note that the term \\"allergic\\" is not technically accurate in this context. Aquagenic urticaria is a rare condition wherein individuals develop an itchy skin reaction upon contact with water, regardless of its temperature or chemical composition. While it is not a true histamine-releasing allergic reaction like other forms of urticaria, the symptoms experienced can resemble an allergic response. Aquagenic urticaria is a form of physical urticaria, which means that it is triggered by a physical stimulus, in this case, contact with water. The exact cause of the condition is not well understood, although some theories suggest that it could be related to an immune system response to water or to a water-soluble substance present on the skin. The prevalence of aquagenic urticaria is extremely low, with only a few dozen cases reported in medical literature. Due to this rarity, the condition can often go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as another form of contact dermatitis or allergy. Diagnosis typically involves conducting a water challenge test, where the skin is exposed to water under controlled conditions and observed for any reactions. Managing aquagenic urticaria can be quite challenging for affected individuals, as water is an essential part of daily life. Treatment options may include the use of antihistamines, oral corticosteroids, and topical creams to help manage itchiness and skin reactions. However, these treatments may not always be effective in preventing or controlling symptoms. Lifestyle adjustments are often necessary for those with aquagenic urticaria, including minimizing skin contact with water, using raincoats or umbrellas during rain or snow, avoiding activities like swimming or sweating heavily, and opting for sponge baths rather than showers. It is also important to stay vigilant in identifying and avoiding potential triggers, as individual reactions to water exposure can vary widely. In summary, while the condition is rare and not a true allergic reaction, aquagenic urticaria does exist and poses challenges for those affected. Understanding its mechanisms, accurate diagnosis, and effective management can help improve the quality of life for individuals living with this uncommon sensitivity to water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Oregon Voters Approve Tax Increase Two ballot measures that would raise taxes on businesses and higher-income residents in Oregon appeared headed for approval late Tuesday. The tax increases, which would raise about 727 million largely for public education and social services, were approved last year by the Legislature, but later put to a public referendum after opponents gathered signatures in a petition campaign. The Legislature, controlled by Democrats, has already put the 727 million into the current budget. So if the ballot items, known as Measures 66 and 67, had been rejected, lawmakers would have been forced to hold a special session to find other ways to reduce spending or raise revenue. Tax measures have frequently failed at the polls in Oregon, one of only five states without a state sales tax. The state depends largely on income and property taxes to raise revenue. Experts noted that, given the broader recession and Oregon’s 11 percent unemployment rate, Measures 66 and 67 had been carefully drawn to focus on wealthier residents and businesses. Measure 66 raises income taxes on individuals who earn more than 125,000 and on couples who earn more than 250,000, less than 3 percent of the state population. Measure 67 raises taxes and fees on most businesses. While some large businesses could see taxes increase by tens of thousands of dollars per year, many would pay an extra 140 in state fees. Business groups opposed Measure 67 but they were outspent by unions for teachers and public employees.

First Up: Tax Cut Extension AZUZ: First up, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003: Should they stay, or should they go? When they were passed, these cuts lowered everyone's taxes. But the debate has been whether these cuts should be extended for everyone. Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to extend the tax cuts, but only for families that make less than 250,000 a year. If you make more than that, your taxes would go up. Democrats argue that the government can't afford to continue the tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Republicans say that not extending those cuts could hurt the economy even more.

That is, until the first day of school Wednesday in the middle school they reopened. \\"She hadn't been told where the staff bathroom was. Before she was able to be told, she had to pee, so she used the girls bathroom one single time.\\" One parent found out, and took to a private Achille Facebook group to complain. That's where the threats started. Adults called Maddie by \\"it\\" and \\"thing.\\" Some said she should be stabbed or beat up. One even suggested it was open hunting season for transgender people. \\"That's a threat against her life--that's scary,\\" Rose said. \\"These are adults making threats-- I don't understand it.\\" Rose said her usually upbeat and positive daughter is afraid for her life. \\"She's an awesome kid. To see any fear in her,I can't explain how bad that hurts me for them to hurt her.\\" As a precaution, the Bryan County Sheriff suggested closing campus Monday and Tuesday. Superintendent Rick Beene agreed. He said there haven't been any problems with Maddie over the past two years until the adults' comments last week. Beene says he and the school can't control what parents post online, and that several parents in the group weren't even from Achille. The sheriff said the mother filed a protective order against one parent but no other arrests have been made, however several agencies including the FBI are stepping in to see if any comments constitute a hate crime.

The local superintendent said the social media posts do not represent the school district. In now removed posts on an Achille school district parents group Facebook page, dozens of derogatory statements and threats were made against a female middle school student who is transgender. “If he wants to be female, make him female. A good sharp knife will do the trick,” one person wrote. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video ACHILLE, Okla. — Schools in a small Oklahoma town will remain closed Tuesday amid controversial social comments made about a transgender middle school student. The comments were posted by adults on a parents’ page, with a person commenting, “If he wants to be a female, make him a female. A good sharp knife will do the job really quick.” Achille superintedent Rick Beene said they were asked to close schools for part of the week, citing the possibility of demonstrations. “The thought was, for law enforcement, that you can have an opposing group that might be here and that could lead to problems so law enforcement asked me if we could shut down until Wednesday so they didn’t have to worry about those 360 kids in addition to what they were already having to deal with,” Beene said. “The problem is, when you get into a small town, you don’t have to get a permit to demonstrate, therefore the problem with that is you don’t know who’s showing up, you don’t know what time they’re going to show up or anything like that.” Beene said the group ‘Achille ISD Parent Group’ is not an official page tied to their school. In fact, he said most of the people participating in the conversation are not parents of any students. “Our kids, our parents, most of our community is very, very good people... very open to all ethnicities, all populations and, really, we’ve got a group of kids that love each other,” he said. “We know of no bullying as far as this one situation is concerned.” Other comments made include “Why are parents letting their kids be transgender?” It did not take long for organizations outside of Achille to jump to the student’s defense, such as Sara Cunningham, founder of the Oklahoma City-based group 'Free Mom Hugs.' “My heart just sank when I realized what was happening,” Cunningham told News 4. “But, I can say that, if one thing, one positive thing came out of that post is the exposure of the power of fear and ignorance, and I mean that term respectfully but that is a perfect example to the world of what fear and ignorance can do.” Cunningham has sent an open letter in light of the situation, offering support and resources such as LGBTQ sensitivity training. \\"We have a beautiful, vibrant transgender community here in Oklahoma City... what would it look like if we brought in a transgender individual and sat at a table with the principal there and just simply shared our stories?\\" she said. Beene said they are open to new resources for training. \\"I need education; we all need to be educated. It’s certainly something that people didn’t deal with 20, 30 years ago,\\" he told News 4. Beene said he does not anticipate schools to be closed beyond Tuesday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A 12-year-old transgender student named Maddie faced violent threats from adults on social media after using the girls' bathroom at Achille Public Schools in Oklahoma.

She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day.

I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts.

Plot title: Cyrano de Bergerac Movie plot: In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly... My question: Who is Cyrano's friend?

Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as \\"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man.

Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", an innuendo-laden blues.

Riverton was a parliamentary election in the Southland of New Zealand region .","completion":"While the two sentences provided are related and share some similarities, they do not mean exactly the same thing. Let's break down both sentences to understand their differences. Sentence 1: \\"Riverton was a parliamentary electorate in the New Zealand region of Southland.\\" In this sentence, \\"Riverton\\" is described as a \\"parliamentary electorate\\" which is an area represented by one or more elected Members of Parliament (MPs). The sentence communicates that Riverton was (and still is) a political division for the purpose of electing representatives to the New Zealand Parliament. It specifies that this electorate is located in the region of Southland in New Zealand. Sentence 2: \\"Riverton was a parliamentary election in the Southland of New Zealand region.\\" In this sentence, \\"Riverton\\" is described as a \\"parliamentary election,\\" which slightly changes the meaning. A parliamentary election is a process through which people vote for their preferred candidates, who then represent them as MPs in the Parliament. Here, it seems to indicate that Riverton was an event or process of electing representatives, but not necessarily the area or division of representation. Additionally, \\"the Southland of New Zealand region\\" is a less accurate phrasing as compared to \\"the New Zealand region of Southland\\" used in the first sentence. In summary, the first sentence accurately describes Riverton as a parliamentary electorate, representing a geographical and political area for electing MPs, located in the Southland region of New Zealand. The second sentence, however, mistakenly describes Riverton as a parliamentary election process, rather than the area itself, and uses a less accurate phrasing to describe the location. It's important to note that the intended meaning of the second sentence might be similar to the first one, but due to its phrasing, it doesn't convey the same message."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following books were either written by Prior or are posthumous collections of magazine articles and unpublished papers that he wrote : The following books were either written by Prior or are unpublished collections of periodical articles and posthumous papers he wrote :","completion":"While these two sentences share similarities in terms of their general structure and subject matter, they have subtle differences in meaning and focus. 1. The first sentence: \\"The following books were either written by Prior or are posthumous collections of magazine articles and unpublished papers that he wrote.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on identifying the books that were written by Prior and those that are collections of his magazine articles and unpublished papers compiled after his death (posthumous collections). The use of \\"magazine articles\\" specifies that these are the articles published in magazines and not in other forms of periodicals. The words \\"unpublished papers\\" refer to works that were not published during Prior's lifetime. 2. The second sentence: \\"The following books were either written by Prior or are unpublished collections of periodical articles and posthumous papers he wrote.\\" In this sentence, the structure remains similar, mentioning the books written by Prior, but the focus shifts slightly. Instead of \\"magazine articles,\\" the term \\"periodical articles\\" is used. This broadens the range of Prior's published articles, encompassing not just magazines, but also newspapers, journals, and other periodical publications. In this sentence, \\"posthumous papers\\" are not specified to be unpublished, so it could include papers that were published during his lifetime and after his death. To summarize, the main differences between these two sentences are: - The first sentence refers specifically to magazine articles, while the second one encompasses a broader range of periodical articles. - The first sentence emphasizes the posthumous collections of unpublished papers, while the second sentence refers to posthumous papers without emphasizing their publication status. While both sentences convey a similar message regarding books written by Prior and those consisting of his work, the distinctions in the types of articles and the publication status of the papers create nuanced differences between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name? The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"...

Answer the question...plant that leaves close when you touch it??","completion":"The plant you are referring to is scientifically known as Mimosa pudica. It is commonly known by many names, such as the sensitive plant, shameplant, shy plant, touch-me-not, or the sleepy plant. The unique feature of this plant is its rapid response to physical stimulation, which results in the closing or folding of its leaves. Mimosa pudica is a perennial herb that belongs to the family Fabaceae. It is native to South and Central America, but it has spread to various tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The plant has a creeping growth habit with small, spiky thorns on its stems and part of its leaves. The compound leaves are arranged in a feather-like pattern, with several small leaflets along a central axis. The plant produces small, fluffy, pink-purple flowers. The rapid response to touch is attributed to a phenomenon known as thigmonasty or seismonasty. This reaction is a defense mechanism that the plant has evolved to protect itself from herbivores, harmful insects, and physical damage. When the leaves are touched or disturbed in any way, the plant interprets this as a potential threat and triggers a series of chemical and electrical changes in the cells of the leaf. The leaf folding occurs because of displacement of water in the cells at the base of the leaflets. When a leaf receives a stimulus, a signal is transmitted from the leaf to the base of the leaflets, causing the specialized motor cells (pulvini) to lose water (turgor pressure) quickly. This change in water pressure causes the folding or closing of the leaflets. The whole process takes just a few seconds. Apart from touch, the sensitive plant also responds to other environmental factors such as heat, light, and moisture. In the evening, the leaves of Mimosa pudica fold up, giving it the nickname of the \\"sleepy plant.\\" When the plant is exposed to sunlight, the leaves gradually open. This phenomenon is known as nyctinasty. Additionally, in the case of inadequate water supply, the plant may also exhibit leaf folding to conserve water. Despite its intriguing leaf movements, Mimosa pudica has some drawbacks. In some parts of the world, it is considered an invasive weed and can overrun native plants. Moreover, the plant's seeds contain mimosine, an amino acid that may be toxic to animals if ingested in large quantities. In conclusion, Mimosa pudica is an extraordinary plant with the unique ability to close its leaves when touched. This fascinating reaction is a defense mechanism that has evolved as a response to various threats in its environment. The plant's movements are a result of various biochemical and electrical changes within its cells, making it a prime example of how plants can adapt to their surroundings."},{"prompt":"Question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

People heading to work in Chelyabinsk heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt the shock wave. According to Russian space agency Roscosmos, the fireball, travelling at a speed of 30km per second, had burnt very brightly across the horizon, leaving a long white trail that could be seen as far as 200km away. Car alarms went off, thousands of windows shattered and mobile phone networks were disrupted. \\"I was driving to work, it was quite dark, but it suddenly became as bright as if it were day,\\" said Viktor Prokofiev, 36, a resident of Yekaterinburg in the Urals Mountains. \\"I felt like I was blinded by headlights.\\" The meteorite, which weighed about 20 tons and may have been made of iron, entered Earth's atmosphere and broke apart 30-50km above ground, according to Russia's Academy of Sciences.

Given the question: The Tasmanian devil is a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter, spending the days in dense bush or in a hole.[64] It has been speculated that nocturnalism may have been adopted to avoid predation by eagles and humans.[65] Young devils are predominantly crepuscular.[66] There is no evidence of torpor.[67] Young devils can climb trees, but this becomes more difficult as they grow larger.[68][69] Devils can scale trees of trunk diameter larger than 40 cm (16 in), which tend to have no small side branches to hang onto, up to a height of around 2.5–3 m (8.2–9.8 ft). Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a height of 4 metres (13.1 ft), and can climb a tree to 7 m (23 ft) if it is not vertical.[70] Adult devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape.[71] Devils can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are 50 metres (160 ft) in width, including icy cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically.

When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.

Please briefly summarize this news article: It's All Your Money: U.S. Aid to Pakistan Foreign aid is always controversial, especially at a time when the United States is broke, when U.S. government audits show that the money given to other nations is wasted and misused and when countries that receive the money frankly don’t like the United States. The latest country under scrutiny is Pakistan. More than 20 billion has been given to Pakistan since Sept. 11, 2001. President Obama is proposing almost 3 billion in aid for the supposed ally in the War on Terror for fiscal year 2012. That includes: - 1.6 billion for police and military; - 150 million for what the State Department calls \\"good government and democracy building\\"; - 122 million for health, AIDS and \\"family planning\\"; - 145 million for education. The rest goes to economic development and humanitarian assistance. Despite all of the aid given to Pakistan, polls show the country has a negative view of the U.S. A 2010 BBC poll found that 52 percent of Pakistanis don’t like the U.S. A majority oppose U.S. drone strikes against the Taliban, and the Pakistani Parliament on Saturday Now with the recent discovery and death of Usama bin Laden, some U.S. lawmakers are questioning why we continue to support the nation that may have harboring the most wanted terrorist. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher(R-Cal), who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has introduced a bill to cut off aid completely. Rohrabacher believes the discovery of bin Laden’s compound is proof that Pakistan’s leaders have been enabling al Qaida and the Taliban. “ They’ve been arming these people to kill our troops,” said Rohrabacher. “They nuzzle up to communist China, they’ve been building nukes at our expense and now we know they have been giving aid and comfort to Usama bin Laden.” Rohrabacher says continuing to aid Pakistan makes the U.S. look foolish. “The fact is the Pakistanis are treating us like fools because we're acting like fools. We're giving money to someone who obviously is working against the basic interests and national security interests of our own country.” Yet there are others who say the U.S. should continue its aid to Pakistan. They believe cutting development aid would have an even more negative effect. “I think it's really crucial that we don’t back away specifically our humanitarian and economic assistance,” said Rebecca Winthrop, Director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution. “That is a critical ingredient especially things like education and job creation for a stable long term Pakistan which is in our national security interest.” Winthrop says the U.S. needs to evaluate its aid models and make sure it is properly dispersed. “I think what we need to do is redouble our efforts in the economic assistance, humanitarian aid, education would be a great thing to fund, because that is really what the Pakistani citizens want.” How much does the President's proposed 3 billion in aid to Pakistan cost you? Click here to use the taxpayer calculator While foreign aid is less than 2 percent of the federal budget and Pakistan gets less than Israel & Egypt, here's another way to look at the 3 billion. Excluding Social Security and Medicare, a married couple earning 50,000 pays 260 a year in income taxes. At that rate, 11 million Americans would have to work an entire year just to pay for the aid to Pakistan. Fox News' Laura Prabucki contributed to this report.","completion":"The US foreign aid provided to Pakistan is under scrutiny, particularly at a time when there is evidence of wasted and misused funds among countries receiving the aid.

Law of the United States: Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty. In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States. Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994.

As the Mayor of Memphis, he works closely with the Memphis City Council, which is the legislative branch of the city's government. The City Council is responsible for making key decisions and enacting ordinances, resolutions, and regulations that shape the growth and development of the city. The Memphis City Council consists of 13 members in total. These council members are elected from a combination of single-member districts and super districts. There are seven single-member districts, each representing a specific geographic area within Memphis, and two super districts composed of three council members each. The super districts are larger areas that encompass multiple single-member districts. As Mayor Jim Strickland's role is executive, he is not considered a council member but collaborates closely with the 13 council members in governing Memphis. Mayor Strickland works with the council to develop and implement city policies, ensure the efficient delivery of city services, and plan for the city's future growth and development. These 13 council members serve staggered, four-year terms. Each council member is elected via nonpartisan elections, meaning that there are no formal party affiliations.

(CNN) -- The Northeast saw its third blizzard of the month on Thursday, with more than two feet of snow piling up in parts of Massachusetts and New York, unleashing yet another wave of school and work closures, dangerous road conditions, and flight cancellations. Some areas could see another foot or more of accumulation by Friday. New York City's Parks Department warned residents to stay out of city parks after snow brought down a tree limb that struck a man dead in Central Park. Much of upstate New York had between 22 and 30 inches of snow by Thursday evening. Massachusetts is averaging 22 inches across the state. Pennsylvania has seen between 8 and 16 inches of snow so far. Some areas could see one to two more feet of snow by Friday. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris says the majority of snowfall will occur overnight. The storm canceled more than a thousand flights at New York-area airports, said John Kelly, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Most cancellations were at Newark Liberty International Airport, with LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport also scrapping flights. The New York Police Department said the man killed by the falling tree limb in Central Park was 56. A few minutes after that incident, an entire tree crashed into a city bus two blocks north, though no injuries were reported. The Parks Department said both incidents were likely caused by the accumulation of wet, heavy snow on trees. Still, the storm hasn't yet wreaked as much havoc as did February's two earlier blizzards. Power companies in the New York area are reporting few outages. About 100 customers scattered throughout New York and nearby Westchester County were without power Thursday evening, according to Con Edison of New York spokeswoman Sara Banda. The Long Island Light and Power Company reported that just 60 of its 1.1 million customers were without power Thursday night. The New York Power Authority hasn't experienced any outages, according to a spokesperson. The airlines said that it was too early to determine what conditions would be like Friday. Most carriers were waiving change fees for passengers wanting to postpone flights scheduled for Thursday and Friday. Transportation systems throughout the Northeast were bracing for more snow and rain on Thursday night and Friday. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has nearly 300 pieces of equipment located at airports, bridges, and tunnels. The Long Island Railroad added eight eastbound trains Thursday afternoon for passengers leaving work early due to the storm. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transport Authority has salt trucks out and crews standing by in anticipation of worsening conditions into the evening.

(AP Photo/Joe Epstein) (Associated Press) A winter storm plodded up the Atlantic coast on Friday, delivering a powerful dose of wet snow, heavy rain with flooding potential and damaging winds near 50 mph in the Northeast as utility companies prepped for possible widespread outages due to toppled trees and near-blizzard conditions. One day after sections of northeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Maine dealt with upward of 20 inches of snow and portions of northern New England weathered heavy rains that pushed some rivers toward flood levels, more of the same was forecast throughout Friday. The latest winter storm was packing heavy snow that could dump a foot or more in some areas and powerful, potentially damaging winds that could cause power outages and complicate any cleanup. The National Weather Service said a potent area of low pressure was expected to linger off Long Island on Friday before drifting slowly north toward southern New England and weakening on Saturday. The slow-moving storm by Friday morning had dumped about 10 inches of snow in New York City, where a man was killed by a falling snow-laden tree branch in Central Park _ one of at least three deaths being blamed on the storm. In northeastern Pennsylvania, National Guard forces rescued dozens of high school students on a ski trip in Susquehanna County when their buses got stuck on Route 374. A Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency spokesman said the 70 students and chaperones were taken to a Red Cross center in Uniondale, and no injuries were reported. Nearly 20 inches of snow blanketed Pocono Summit, in the northeastern part of the state, while farther south, Philadelphia received just a dusting from the first day of the double-barreled storm. Up to 12 more inches was expected in the city, which has endured it's snowiest winter, with more than 70 inches. In western Pennsylvania, a peak wind gust of 56 mph was reported. A fraction of an inch of snow that fell in Pittsburgh by early afternoon Thursday was enough to break the city's record for the snowiest month since recordkeeping began in 1884. Parts of western Maine received nearly a foot a snow, while southern and mid-coastal sections of the state received more than 3 inches of rain and faced up to 7 more inches. The Presumpscot River in Westbrook was expected to crest at 9 feet over flood stage by Friday afternoon. Several major roads were closed in the flood-prone New Hampshire town of Goffstown, police said, and slight flooding along the Piscataquog River had water creeping toward nearby houses. Residents were told to prepare for possible evacuation. In New Jersey, the snow totals ranged from about 3 inches in Atlantic City to 18 inches in Passaic and Sussex counties in northern New Jersey, which could get up to 2 feet of snow before the sky clears on Saturday. A day after airlines canceled hundreds of flights across the Northeast, the real threat was expected to be the strong wind that could create blizzard conditions. The National Weather Service put much of the East Coast under wind advisories and warnings into Friday. The agency warned that winds could blow steadily between 20 and 30 mph in some areas, with gusts of 55 mph or higher in coastal and mountainous areas. \\"Your tree may fall down; your neighbor's may not,\\" said Kristina Pydynowski, a meteorologist for AccuWeather, a private forecasting company in State College, Pa. She said dense, wet snow weighing down trees would make it more likely for strong winds to knock them down. And power will probably be hardest to restore in areas where heavy snow keeps repair crews at bay. Coastal New England was seeing mostly rain and was under coastal flood watches. In upstate New York, residents dealt with a second day of the protracted storm, which pounded the area with up to 2 feet of snow. More than 79,000 utility customers were without power early Friday, most in the Hudson Valley. State police reported two deaths in traffic accidents on slick roads Thursday, one near Rochester and another southeast of Syracuse. Vermont had more than 10,000 outages. Nearly 5,000 utility customers in New Jersey were without electricity, and there were scattered outages throughout Pennsylvania. ___ Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Michael Rubinkam in Allentown, Pa., and George Walsh in Albany, N.Y., and AP Airlines Writer Joshua Freed in Minneapolis. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Northeast United States experienced its third blizzard of the month, with over two feet of snow accumulating in parts of Massachusetts and New York, causing school and work closures, hazardous road conditions, and flight cancellations.

Title: This Island Earth Movie plot: Dr. Cal Meacham (Rex Reason), a noted scientist and jet pilot, is sent an unusual substitute for electronic condensers that he ordered (after nearly crashing a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star during a cross-country flight, prior to being saved by a mysterious green glow). Instead, he receives instructions and parts to build a complex communication device called an interocitor. Although neither Meacham nor his assistant Joe Wilson (Robert Nichols) have heard of such a device, they immediately begin construction. When they finish, a mysterious man named Exeter (Jeff Morrow) appears on the device's screen and tells Meacham he has passed the test. His ability to build the interocitor demonstrates that he is gifted enough to be part of Exeter's special research project. Intrigued, Meacham is picked up at the airport by an unmanned, computer-controlled Douglas DC-3 aircraft with no windows. Landing in a remote area of Georgia, he finds an international group of top-flight scientists already present, including an old flame, Dr. Ruth Adams (Faith Domergue). Cal is confused by Ruth's failure to recognize him and suspicious of Brack (Lance Fuller) and other odd-looking men leading the project. Cal and Ruth flee with a third scientist, Steve Carlson (Russell Johnson), but their car is attacked and Carlson is killed. When they take off in a Stinson 108 light aircraft, Cal and Ruth watch as the facility and all its inhabitants are incinerated. Then their aircraft is drawn up by a bright beam into a flying saucer.

Write an article based on this \\"Car giant Volkswagen says German prosecutors have expanded their probe of the emissions scandal to include the firm's chairman of the board.\\"","completion":"Title: German Prosecutors Expand Emissions Scandal Probe to Include Volkswagen's Chairman of the Board Introduction: Volkswagen, the world-renowned car manufacturer, has been under investigation due to their recent involvement in an emissions scandal that has tarnished the company's reputation. Now, it seems the ongoing probe has expanded even further, bringing the chairman of the board under the spotlight. This article delves into what this development could mean for the German automaker, while also offering an overview of the emissions scandal. Step 1: Provide Background on the Emissions Scandal In 2015, Volkswagen was found guilty of fitting a significant number of their diesel cars with a device that could cheat emissions tests. The \\"defeat device\\" was designed to detect when a car was undergoing emissions testing and would then lower the vehicle's pollutant emissions temporarily, complying with legal limits during these tests. However, these lowered emissions did not reflect the actual pollution levels during everyday vehicle use. Step 2: Discuss the Impact of the Scandal on Volkswagen The emissions scandal has had severe consequences for Volkswagen, leading to the recall of millions of vehicles worldwide. The German automaker has suffered reputational damage and has faced billions of dollars in fines, settlements, and related costs, in addition to dealing with the internal management shake-ups. As trust in the brand waned, they endeavored to rebuild their image by investing in the development of electric vehicles. Step 3: Explain the Expansion of the Probe to the Chairman of the Board The probe led by German prosecutors has now been expanded to include the chairman of Volkswagen's board, holding them accountable for any potential wrongdoing or negligence in the oversight of the company during the scandal. This indicates that the prosecutors are scrutinizing the entire corporate structure of the automotive giant, leaving no stone unturned in their pursuit of justice and transparency. Step 4: Analyze the Potential Ramifications of this Expansion With the chairman of the board under investigation, there could be significant implications for Volkswagen, depending on the outcome of the inquiry. If the chairman is found to be complicit, the German automaker could face increased fines, lawsuits, and even further damage to their reputation as a trustworthy vehicle manufacturer. Additionally, there could be further personnel changes within the company, particularly among senior leadership positions, causing additional operational upheaval. Step 5: Offer Perspectives on Volkswagen's Future While the expansion of the probe may bring increased scrutiny and uncertainty for Volkswagen and its management, it also presents an opportunity for the company to learn from past mistakes and reaffirm their commitment to corporate ethics and environmental responsibility. Volkswagen's ongoing investment in electric vehicles could help them transition away from diesel engines and, in the long run, regain the trust and support of their customers. Conclusion: As the German prosecutors extend their probe into the emissions scandal to include the chairman of Volkswagen's board, the implications for the car giant could be far-reaching, potentially resulting in increased penalties, legal action, and reputational damage. Nevertheless, Volkswagen has the opportunity to embrace change and a renewed commitment to ethical and environmentally friendly practices, which may facilitate the restoration of their esteemed position in the automotive industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north. answer the following question: What are the names of the two people who the genre of Chinese travel literature became popular with?

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where are the migrants coming from that fuel the growth of the city that is number one in OCED growth? Throughout most of its history, Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world. By 500 CE, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for world's largest city. Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities, such as Baghdad, Chang'an, Kaifeng and Merv for the position of world's most populous city until the 12th century. It never returned to being the world's largest, but remained Europe's largest city from 1500 to 1750, when it was surpassed by London.The Turkish Statistical Institute estimates that the population of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was 14,377,019 at the end of 2014, hosting 19 percent of the country's population. Then about 97–98% of the inhabitants of the metropolitan municipality were within city limits, up from 89% in 2007 and 61% in 1980. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side. While the city ranks as the world's 5th-largest city proper, it drops to the 24th place as an urban area and to the 18th place as a metro area because the city limits are roughly equivalent to the agglomeration. Today, it forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe, alongside Moscow. The city's annual population growth of 3.45 percent ranks as the highest among the seventy-eight largest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across the country, as the second and third fastest-growing OECD metropolises are the Turkish cities of İzmir and Ankara. Istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century, with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and 2000. This growth in population comes, in part, from an expansion of city limits—particularly between 1980 and 1985, when the number of Istanbulites nearly doubled. The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by migrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions. The... Answer:","completion":"The migrants fueling the growth of Istanbul, which holds the position of the number one city in terms of annual population growth among the seventy-eight largest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED), predominantly come from eastern Turkey. These migrants seek better employment opportunities and improved living conditions in the rapidly growing city. Istanbul has experienced substantial growth, especially during the second half of the 20th century. The population of Istanbul increased tenfold between 1950 and 2000. This growth can be attributed in part to the expansion of city limits, which led to a significant increase in the number of inhabitants. For instance, the population of Istanbul nearly doubled between 1980 and 1985 alone. The high population growth in Istanbul mirrors an urbanization trend observed across Turkey. Other major cities of the country, such as Izmir and Ankara, also rank as the second and third fastest-growing metropolises within the OCED. This indicates a continued shift in population from rural or less developed areas to major urban centers. The influx of migrants from eastern Turkey can be ascribed to several factors, such as better job prospects, higher living standards, and access to essential services, including healthcare and education. Additionally, the city's dynamic economy and cosmopolitan character continue to attract not only local migrants but also immigrants from other countries, further contributing to its growth. Overall, the population growth of Istanbul, which ranks as the highest among the largest metropolises in the OCED, is primarily driven by migrants hailing from eastern Turkey who are in search of better career opportunities and living conditions. This migration contributes to Istanbul's status as one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is the result of instituting civil action? Possible A: bad feelings, confusion, going to court, hurt feelings, sandwiches Why is \\"going to court\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Going to court\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context of instituting civil action. Civil action is a legal process wherein an individual or entity takes another party to court to resolve a dispute or seek restitution for damages incurred. This process typically involves various stages such as filing a complaint, discovery, motions, and, finally, a court trial if not settled beforehand. Therefore, \\"going to court\\" is a natural outcome and a central part of instituting civil action, making it a common-sense answer. In contrast, the other possible answers provided do not directly relate to the legal proceedings associated with civil action and, thus, are not aligned with human common sense. While it is true that \\"bad feelings\\" and \\"hurt feelings\\" might arise as a consequence of instituting civil action, they are not essential aspects or results of the process itself. Instead, they are potential emotional repercussions for the involved parties that could stem from any interpersonal conflict. On the other hand, \\"confusion\\" might occur during the legal process, especially if the individuals involved are not familiar with the intricacies of civil litigation. However, it is not a defining outcome, as those involved will typically employ legal counsel to help them navigate the complexities of their case. Lastly, \\"sandwiches\\" have no direct association with civil action at all; instead, it seems inconsequential and irrelevant to the context of the question. In summary, \\"going to court\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the central aspect of instituting civil action, i.e., engaging in the legal process to resolve disputes or seek damages. The other possible answers either pertain to tangential emotional effects or have no logical connection to civil action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: ATLANTA, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are on the rise nationally for the first time 2006, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with increasing rates among men responsible for a healthy portion of the increases. Researchers write in the new report that regular screening is recommended for young people, many of whom may not suspectthey have an infection. \\"The consequences of STDs are especially severe for young people,\\" said Dr. Gail Bolan, director of CDC's Division of STD Prevention, in a press release. \\"Because chlamydia and gonorrhea often have no symptoms, many infections go undiagnosed and this can lead to lifelong repercussions for a woman's reproductive health, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.\\" In the study, researchers report the roughly 1.4 million cases of chlamydia have risen 2.8 percent since 2013, to 456.1 cases per 100,000 people. Rates of primary and secondary syphilis, or P&S;, and gonorrhea also increased significantly by 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent from 2013 to 2014. The rates work out to 110.7 per 100,000 people infected with gonorrhea and 6.3 per 100,000 having P&S.; Rates of P&S; have been increasing since 2000, especially in the case of men who have sex with other men, who accounted for 83 percent of the STD's carriers when the sex of the partner is known. Researchers also noted more than half of MSM diagnosed with syphilis in 2014 were HIV-positive -- which raises further concern that genital sores associated with syphilis could make it easier to transmit HIV. CDC researchers acknowledge that for gay and bisexual people, access to quality health care, homophobia, or stigmas may prevent them from prevention or treatment, which accounts for an even greater risk. Decreases in government funding of health efforts lessened the options available for many people, as well as the outreach and dissemination of information they are responsible for, may be responsible for some of the increases researchers said. \\"Most recently, there have been significant erosions of state and local STD control programs,\\" Bolan told NBC News. \\"Most people don't recognize that the direct clinical care of individuals with sexually transmitted diseases is supported by state and local funds and federal funds.\\" ||||| Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Definition By Mayo Clinic Staff Multimedia Primary syphilis Syphilis is a bacterial infection usually spread by sexual contact. The disease starts as a painless sore — typically on your genitals, rectum or mouth. Syphilis spreads from person to person via skin or mucous membrane contact with these sores. After the initial infection, the syphilis bacteria can lie dormant in your body for decades before becoming active again. Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single injection of penicillin. Without treatment, syphilis can severely damage your heart, brain or other organs, and can be life-threatening. Syphilis rates in the United States have been declining among women since 2010, but rising among men, particularly men who have sex with men. The genital sores associated with syphilis can make it easier to become infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. ||||| The remains of a child who died in the 14th century may disprove an enduring historical conjecture, that Christopher Columbus introduced syphilis to Europe after returning from the New World. Columbus and his crew disembarked in Spain in 1493, and news of his travels spread rapidly across the continent. Shortly thereafter, so too did a largely unfamiliar disease that would plague Europe for centuries. But Austrian researchers have now found instances of syphilis in skeletons that pre-date Columbus's voyage. The skeleton of one child dates to approximately 1320, and is believed to be the earliest evidence of syphilis in Europe. Experts have long debated what caused the mass outbreak of the sexually transmitted disease in the 1490s. One hypothesis, known as the Columbian theory, was that one or more members of Columbus's crew contracted the disease in the Caribbean islands, and returned to Europe infected. Other theories are that African slaves brought the disease with them when transported to Europe, or that a strain of syphilis existed in Europe long before the sudden outbreak. Photo: Alamy Researchers at MedUni Vienna are attempting to determine which is the correct theory. As part of their research, they examined skeletons exhumed from an ancient burial site in Austria. The teeth of multiple of the skeletons show symptoms of congenital syphilis, a form of the disease passed from mother to child. Additional tests will be conducted to confirm the findings, and that the skeletons do in fact date from the 14th century. The disease's march through Europe was first documented during a French invasion of Naples during the First Italian War (1494-1498). Approximately 36 million people worldwide have syphilis today, with 12 million new cases each year according to the World Health Organisation. Despite the recent findings, many scientists insist that more evidence exists to support the Columbian theory than the alternative explanation. ||||| (Vienna ) In 1495, a \\"new\\" disease spread throughout Europe: syphilis. Christopher Columbus was said to have brought this sexually transmitted disease back from his voyage to America. At least, that has been the accepted theory up until now. Using morphological and structural evidence, researchers from the Department of Forensic Medicine and the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology (bone laboratory) at MedUni Vienna have now identified several cases of congenital syphilis dating back to as early as 1320 AD in skeletons from excavations at the cathedral square of St. Pölten, Austria \\"The discovery clearly refutes the previous theory,\\" say study leaders Karl Großschmidt and Fabian Kanz of MedUni Vienna. Congenital syphilis, which is passed from a pregnant mother to her unborn child, was primarily identified by changes to the teeth of skeletons from the 14th century. \\"We found so-called Hutchinson’s teeth with central notches and converging edges and mulberry molars, which are characteristic signs of syphilis,\\" study authors Kanz and Großschmidt (Department of Cell and Developmental Biology) explained. Their findings have now been published in the renowned Journal of Biological and Clinical Anthropology. Thin sections of bones provide perfect examination results The researchers at the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology of the Medical University of Vienna prepared undecalcified bone thin sections from the bones and teeth of the skeletons for histological examination and analysis. These thin sections, which can only be produced in a few places throughout the world, where subsequently examined by a special light microscopy technique to morphologically determine the pathogen involved. Up to now, a total of 9000 skeletons as old as the 9th century AD have been recovered from the excavations in the cathedral square in St. Pölten. The large number of unearthed individuals at one archaeological site is unique in Europe. The recovery was conducted in close collaboration with the Urban Archaeology Department of the state capital of Lower Austria. Additional studies of the living conditions and diseases evident from the skeletons were started. This remarkable discovery of the earliest evidence of syphilis between 1320 and 1390 now awaits confirmation by molecular biological tests and proteomics (examination of the proteome using biochemical methods). The scientists hope to gain further insights from the proteomic analysis, in particular, because the DNA of syphilis decays very rapidly.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856? , can you please find it? George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

By any measure it's historic: The vast majority of Africa's leaders flying to Washington at the invite of the President, whose father was born on the continent, to mark what the White House hopes is a new era of cooperation. While plans for the first African Leaders Summit this week in the nation's capital are ambitious, the reality is the United States still has strides to make on the kind of political and economic relationships in Africa that can benefit both sides. Other nations, namely China, have turned their focus to the continent as a trade partner. Terrorist networks have expanded their reach in some countries, most notably in Nigeria, where hundreds of schoolgirls remain at large after being kidnapped earlier this year.

Alongside have come massive Chinese investments in","completion":"infrastructure, technology, and resources, making China a significant player in Africa's booming economic landscape. To better understand the dynamics and keep up with global competitors, the United States needs to step up its game and develop stronger partnerships with Africa. Here are a few steps the U.S. could take to do this: 1. Increase trade and investment: To foster mutual economic growth and create jobs, the U.S. should encourage more trade and investment between both regions. This involves making it easier for American companies to invest in Africa, offering incentives to potential investors, and promoting African products in the United States market. 2. Infrastructure development: Africa's vast infrastructure needs provide an opportunity for American companies to invest in areas like power generation, transportation, and telecommunications. By doing so, the U.S. can contribute to Africa's economic development while creating business opportunities for American firms. 3. Support education and healthcare initiatives: Investing in Africa's human capital through education and healthcare initiatives will not only improve the standard of living but also pave the way for long-term economic growth. The U.S. can collaborate with African governments and institutions to enable access to quality education and healthcare services across the continent. 4. Strengthen diplomatic relationships: The U.S. should actively engage in diplomatic efforts in Africa, showing commitment to the region and effective communication with its leaders. This includes sending high-level delegations to attend significant events, maintaining an active presence in African capitals, and fostering relationships with emerging political and business leaders. 5. Counter-terrorism cooperation: The U.S. should work in partnership with African countries to address the growing terror threats in the region. Sharing intelligence, training local security forces, and offering logistical support could help African governments counter-terrorism more efficiently and alleviate potential threats to the United States. 6. Promote good governance and democracy: The U.S. must advocate for good governance, rule of law, and transparent institutions in Africa. Encouraging political reforms, supporting electoral processes and institutions, and working on capacity building can help create a more stable and conducive environment for foreign investment and growth. 7. Support sustainable development and climate change initiatives: With many African countries being vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the U.S. must encourage sustainable development and support efforts to mitigate climate change in Africa. This could include technology transfers, financial support, and expertise sharing in renewable energy, agriculture, and coastal protection. By taking these steps, the United States can foster a new era of cooperation with Africa and build lasting relationships that benefit both sides. Moreover, it can improve its standing on the global stage and ensure it remains an influential player in the continent's political, social, and economic future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jerusalem Answer:","completion":"Title: The Secrets of Zachariah Plot: In the ancient city of Jerusalem, a venerable Rabbi named Zachariah has devoted his whole life to the spiritual and historical secrets surrounding the city. With his vast knowledge of mystic Kabbalistic writings and deep understanding of the Torah, Rabbi Zachariah establishes himself as a respected authority and guardian of the city's ancient history. The movie begins with a rising tension between the communities of Jerusalem, due to disputed interpretations of holy writings. Rabbi Zachariah, known for his wisdom and diplomacy, works towards building a bridge between the various factions, bringing them together through their love for the holy city. However, his efforts often face a roadblock as he encounters Brother Peter, a Catholic priest from Rome, who also has a deep love for the city, but with different beliefs. One day, Rabbi Zachariah stumbles upon a hidden ancient manuscript in an old section of the Western Wall. The manuscript claims to reveal a long-lost secret, linked to the construction of Solomon's Temple. Intrigued by the discovery, Rabbi Zachariah embarks on a journey to uncover the truth behind the secret, which could reshape the religious balance and structure of Jerusalem and potentially bring about a new era of unity. As Zachariah pieces together the clues in his pursuit of the truth, he encounters a series of mysterious events and uncovers a dangerous secret society that has been operating in the shadows of Jerusalem for centuries. This secret society, The Order of the Artisans, has been protecting the hidden knowledge related to the Temple of Solomon and would do anything to keep the secret from the world. Rabbi Zachariah is now caught in a conflict between his pursuit for the truth and his loyalty to the people of Jerusalem. Collaborating with an enigmatic historian and expert in ancient texts, Miriam, Rabbi Zachariah slowly unravels the complex layers of the ancient city's past. However, this quest brings him and those close to him into grave danger. Meanwhile, Rabbi Zachariah's relationship with Brother Peter takes a different turn as they are forced to work together to gather valuable information regarding the secret society. Despite their initial hesitations and conflicting beliefs, they come to realize that the forces they are up against threaten the very foundation of both their faiths. As the plot thickens, Zachariah and his growing team of unexpected allies find themselves on both a physical journey through the hidden chambers beneath the city and a spiritual journey as they confront their own beliefs about the nature of faith, unity, and loyalty. Against all odds, they desperately attempt to uncover the truth before it is too late for their beloved city. In the climax of the film, Rabbi Zachariah discovers that the long-lost secret is not only about the physical foundation of Solomon's Temple but a metaphysical one as well - the key to uniting the people of Jerusalem. The power of their shared faith, albeit expressed differently, turns out to be the unifying force needed to combat the threat of the secret society. Ultimately, Rabbi Zachariah and Brother Peter, along with their newly-formed alliance, expose the malevolent Order of the Artisans to the public, bringing peace and unity among the communities of Jerusalem. The story ends with Rabbi Zachariah giving a powerful speech emphasizing the importance of spirituality, understanding and love, as the truest and strongest foundations of any society. The Secrets of Zachariah, a cinematic journey set in the spiritual heart of Jerusalem and the twists and turns of history and faith, is a gripping tale of relentless passion, danger, and the ultimate quest for unity, bound to leave a lasting impact on the audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: On Thursday Fort Waelhem succumbed after a magnificent resistance. The garrison held it until it was a mere heap of ruins, and, indeed, they had the greatest difficulty in making their way out. I think that there is very little doubt that the Germans were using against these forts their largest guns, the great 42-centimetre howitzers. It is known that two of these were brought northwards past Brussels after the fall of Maubeuge, and a fragment which was given to us was almost conclusive. It was brought to us one morning as an offering by a grateful patient, and it came from the neighbourhood of Fort Waelhem. It was a mass of polished steel two feet long, a foot wide, and three inches thick, and it weighed about fifty pounds. It was very irregular in shape, with edges sharp as razors, without a particle of rust upon it. It had been picked up where it fell still hot, and it was by far the finest fragment of shell I have ever seen. Alas we had to leave it behind, and it lies buried in a back-garden beside our hospital.

Given the context provided, Aubrey asked Cameron to borrow 5, and Cameron agreed to the request. In order for Aubrey to obtain the needed money, she would have to open Cameron's wallet, retrieve the 5, and return the wallet to Cameron. Taking out the money and returning the wallet is the most logical and appropriate course of action for Aubrey. This is because she is fulfilling her intention of borrowing the money, and by returning Cameron's wallet, she is demonstrating respect and trust towards Cameron. If Aubrey were to give away the money and return the wallet, it would be contradictory to her initial request of borrowing the money for herself. It is not mentioned anywhere in the context that Aubrey wanted to borrow money to give it away, which makes this choice less plausible. Likewise, \\"making Aubrey happy\\" is not a direct action in itself and does not directly involve the borrowed money or wallet, thus making it an improbable choice.

We want to find what 'r' is in this equation: 0 = -26*r + 299 + 169. Let's follow these steps: 1. First, add 299 and 169 together: 299 + 169 = 468 2. Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -26*r + 468 3. We want to isolate 'r', so let's move the 468 to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 468 from both sides: 0 - 468 = -26*r + 468 - 468 4. This simplifies to: -468 = -26*r 5. Now, we want to figure out what 'r' is. Since -26 is multiplied by 'r', we can find 'r' by dividing both sides of the equation by -26: (-468) / (-26) = (-26*r) / (-26) 6. When we divide, we get: r = 18 So, the value of 'r' is 18!

Police dash cam video of the incident shows Albert Chatfield immediately emerging from his car at an intersection and backpedaling from two police officers who repeatedly shout for him to \\"stop.\\" As he continues to back up through the street one officer pulls out his Taser and after the other officer is heard shouting \\"tase him \\" fires it. Chatfield is knocked to the ground instantly. The city agreed to pay 900 000 to Chatfield's family over the incident one of the fastest settlements in a Taser case in the state ever according to the family's lawyer. Chatfield remains in the hospital after suffering bleeding on his brain due to the fall according to ABC affiliate WCIV. Police had claimed Chatfield assumed a \\"fighting stance\\" as he backpedaled from police. The video shows the man raising his hands but he is slowly backing away from the officers throughout. The police report also described the scene as a busy street saying they were trying to protect Chatfield and others' safety though the video shows just one car in the intersection. The family's lawyer Justin Bamberg blamed the police chase on a mental issue. Police had been called after Chatfield was aggressively tailgating other vehicles. Bamberg said the money would be used to pay for Chatfield 's medical expenses. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the entity. Usage: Albert Chatfield is the given entity. This part of the definition helps to understand which person or thing the sentiment should focus on. Part #2: Determine the author's sentiment towards the entity. Usage: In this case, the author doesn't express a personal sentiment but reports facts and quotes from others. It meets the criteria for a neutral sentiment.

To find \\"a\\", we want to cancel out all the apples on both sides. To do that, we would add up 1174*a apples to both sides. This would look like: 25*a + 1174*a = -1174*a + 1174*a. Now, we have 1199*a = 0. To finish solving for \\"a\\", we just need to divide both sides by 1199. a = 0 / 1199. And that means, a = 0.

Movie title: The Sin of Harold Diddlebock Movie plot: In 1945, twenty-three years after scoring the winning touchdown for his Tate College football team (as told in The Freshman), mild-mannered Harold Diddlebock (Harold Lloyd), who has been stuck in a dull, dead-end book-keeping job for years, is let go by his pompous boss, advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry (Raymond Walburn). He is given an 18 karat Swiss watch that is 'properly inscribed \\"with gratitude and love and kisses for 20 years devoted services\\"' and a check for 2,946.12, the remains of his company investment plan. He bids farewell to Miss Otis (Frances Ramsden), who works at an artist's desk down the aisle, giving her the paid for engagement ring that he had, having planned to marry each of her six older sisters (Hortense, Irma, Harriet, Margie, Claire, and Rosemary) when they had worked there before her. He wanders out, aimlessly through the streets, his life's savings in his pants pocket. While looking through the newspaper want ads for another job, Harold is approached by Wormy (Jimmy Conlin), a local con artist, petty gambler, and racetrack lout, who asks Harold for some money so he can place a bet. Seeing the large amount of cash that Harold has, and hoping to get him drunk enough to acquire some of the cash, Wormy takes the depressed and unemployed Harold downstairs to the local bar for a drink. When Harold tells the bartender, Jake (Edgar Kennedy), that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \\"The Diddlebock\\", one sip of which is enough to release Harold from all his inhibitions, setting him off on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing. A day or two later, Harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister Flora (Margaret Hamilton). He finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe, a ten-gallon cowboy hat, a horse-drawn hansom cab complete with driver, and ownership of a bankrupt circus.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who made the wooden box?

Spanish A:","completion":"Title: \\"The New Adventures of Butch and Sundance\\" Step 1: Establishing the Context In a small, dusty town in the American Old West, the infamous outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid have just completed their latest heist. The law is hot on their heels, and the duo must flee the country in search of a hideaway where they can lay low and plot their next move. Step 2: Introducing the Spanish Element Rumor has it that a haven for outlaws exists in a remote village located deep within the Andes, a region largely inhabited by Spanish speakers. To venture into this new terrain and establish a new life, Butch and Sundance decide they must learn Spanish in order to communicate with the locals and avoid attracting undue attention. Step 3: The Language Learning Journey To achieve this, the duo sets off on a perilous journey across the border into Mexico, where they immerse themselves in a small pueblo to learn Spanish. They enlist the help of a wise and enigmatic language tutor, who turns out to be a former bandit himself, and together they form bonds with the local community. Step 4: Unexpected Complications As Butch and Sundance go about their language learning adventures, they unexpectedly find themselves in the middle of a conflict between the local villagers and a ruthless gang of cattle thieves who have been terrorizing the area. The duo, drawing upon their own outlaw skills, decides to help the villagers take on the brutal gang. Step 5: High-Stakes Showdown In a climactic showdown, Butch and Sundance, now proficient in Spanish, rally the villagers to stand up against the thieves. The pair uses their cunning and newfound language skills to outsmart the gang, leading them into a trap that results in the gang's capture. Step 6: Resolution and New Path Having saved the village and earned the trust of their new neighbors, Butch and Sundance decide to settle down and live a quiet life under the radar, forsaking their outlaw past. Their newfound appreciation for the local language and culture inspires them to keep learning and deepening their connections with the community and each other. In conclusion, the movie plot revolves around Butch and Sundance learning Spanish as they escape the law, and how their language learning journey leads to their involvement in a conflict between Mexican villagers and a cattle thief gang. This adventure ultimately helps them find their own redemption and a new path in a land far from home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer to this question? who has won the most amount of grammys?","completion":"The person who has won the most Grammy Awards in history is the conductor Sir Georg Solti. Over the course of his prolific career, he amassed a total of 31 Grammy Awards, making him the individual with the most Grammy wins to date. Sir Georg Solti was born in Budapest, Hungary, on October 21, 1912, and died in Antibes, France, on September 5, 1997. He was a world-renowned conductor known primarily for his interpretations of the Romantic and operatic repertoire. Solti started his career as a pianist and went on to study under some of the greatest conductors, including Arturo Toscanini and Wilhelm Furtwängler. In the 1930s, Solti worked as both a conductor and a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera. After World War II, he became the musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich and then moved on to become the general music director of the Frankfurt Opera. It was during this time that Solti's conducting career really started to take off. He led the orchestra in performances of Wagner's complete \\"Ring\\" cycle, as well as other operatic works, which garnered attention from the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. In 1961, Solti was appointed musical director of the Royal Opera House, a position he held until 1971. From there, he went on to become the music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a position he held from 1969 until 1991. During his tenure in Chicago, Solti helped mold the orchestra into an internationally recognized ensemble, regularly taking them on successful tours abroad. While Solti's extensive discography covers many different composers and genres, it is his work with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra that has brought him the most Grammy Award recognition. His recordings of Wagner's \\"Ring\\" cycle, Mahler symphonies, and a wide variety of orchestral and choral works contributed significantly to his total Grammy wins. In addition to his 31 competitive Grammy Awards, Solti was also honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, solidifying his place as one of the all-time great conductors in recorded music history. For those primarily interested in popular music genres, it is worth mentioning that Quincy Jones, a producer, composer, and musician, holds the record for the most Grammy nominations (80) and has won 28 Grammy Awards, making him the most celebrated artist in the popular music domain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.

Both islands had populations of birds living there. Which island had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds? Hint: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ).

Read this and answer the question Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%.

Her boyfriend Lokki has a different outlook: He says he enjoys the fun and freedom of life on the streets. \\"I don't really have to worry about anything,\\" says Lokki, 20. \\"I get some food and kick back with the homies.\\" Out of the three friends, Tripp seems to be the most concerned about the future. He says he began living on the streets two years ago, after escaping a violent relationship with his stepfather. \\"If I defended myself against him, I always got looked at badly,\\" he said. \\"So when I turned 18, I left.\\" He stops talking as he watches a homeless man walk by. \\"I'd hate to think that's the way I'm going,\\" says Tripp. \\"That I'm going to end up being 40 years old and on the streets.\\" Getting off the streets is a daunting challenge for these young adults and others like them, who have no address, no job, very little education, and many times drug addictions and mental health issues. \\"We see a lot of kids really since age of 7 or 8 [who] haven't had any real roots to call their own,\\" according to Tom Manning, spokesman for Covenant House, which helps those who are young and homeless. \\"Those are the 18-year-olds who [have] very limited education and really need to start from square one.\\" Manning, who has worked with homeless youths for 20 years, said a key goal is reaching these young adults before they \\"disappear into the streets.\\" \\"It sounds like a movie, but it's true: Pimps and traffickers, they spot these kids and go after them,\\" Manning said. \\"If we don't get to them, many will end up on drugs or in prison.\\" The youths can be helped, he said, if they can learn to establish healthy relationships with others. \\"It's a trust issue: Most of these kids have been abused and taken advantage of by every adult they've met,\\" Manning said. Trust is at the heart of the family that Lokki has created for a small group of his friends living on the streets of Denver. They call themselves \\"Juggalos\\" -- the name for fans of the rap group Insane Clown Posse. But now, the name has a more important meaning. \\"Juggalos started as a family for people who feel like they don't have family,\\" Lokki explained. \\"Other people see it as a gang, but we just look out for each other any way we can.\\" They mostly hang out, swimming in the Platte River or -- if they manage to panhandle a few dollars -- buying beer or marijuana. Most days, they eat lunch at Sox Place, which was set up in 2002 by Doyle \\"Sox\\" Robinson. He got his street name after spending a year handing out clean socks to street kids. Every day, about 100 young people come by to eat lunch, use the computers, watch movies and also pick up a fresh pair of socks. \\"They are just like any other kids out there, they have the same struggles, the same issues,\\" Doyle said. \\"They still want love, they want acceptance, they want protections, they want rules, they want to be held accountable.\\" Robinson said his goal is simply to provide a stable place where they can be loved for who they are. \\"I don't try to change them,\\" he said. \\"If they want to change, we're here for them. If they don't want to change, we're still going to love them.\\" Robinson, 55, says his Christian faith motivates him to help these kids, although he doesn't try to push religion on anyone at Sox Place.

She said she has been sexually abused since she was 6 years old and was in and out of foster care until recently. Now, she is living in a camp with other homeless kids, hiding from her pimp. \\"Yeah, it's not a house, but a house isn't everything,\\" she said. \\"Family. Love. Friends. This is my family.

It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Floods were able to be forecast by using a combination of tide-predicting machines, meteorological data, and evolving technology. Here are the step-by-step justifications for how they were able to do this: 1. Invention of the tide-predicting machine (1872): Sir William Thomson's tide-predicting machine provided an early method of forecasting potential flooding by calculating predicted tide levels for a specific location and time frame. This allowed for more reliable navigation in shallow waters and served as an early warning system for high tides that could lead to flooding. 2. Collection and analysis of meteorological data: Over time, the collection of weather data, such as rainfall, atmospheric pressure, and wind patterns, helped scientists and researchers better understand the relationships between these factors and the occurrence of floods. By tracking and analyzing this data, they were able to develop more accurate flood forecasts and identify areas at high risk of flooding. 3. Development of hydrological models: With the advancement of science and technology, researchers started developing hydrological models that use mathematical equations to simulate the movement of water through a watershed. These models consider various factors, such as precipitation, soil properties, and terrain, to predict the likelihood of floods based on the current and forecasted weather conditions. 4. Remote sensing and satellite technology: As satellite technology improved, experts began to collect data on precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation cover from remote locations. This allowed for more accurate flood forecasting, as the data provided more real-time information about the conditions that lead to flooding events. 5. Integration of data and technology: By combining the data collected from tide-predicting machines, meteorological data, hydrological models, and remote sensing technology, flood forecasting systems have become increasingly more accurate and advanced. Today, weather and hydrological agencies around the world work together to provide timely and reliable flood forecasts to help manage flood risks and minimize damage. In conclusion, floods were able to be forecast through the integration of tide-predicting machines, meteorological data, hydrological models, and advancements in remote sensing technology. These tools and methods have evolved over time to provide more accurate and sophisticated flood predictions, ultimately helping to mitigate the risks associated with flooding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Liz is interviewed by a psychiatrist, Dr. Philippa Horwood (Embeth Davidtz), and describes what has happened to the four. Liz describes how she told Martyn (Daniel Brocklebank) about her unrequited love for Mike; Martyn promised to help, as he and Liz were best friends. Martyn took his four classmates, musician's son Mike, his best friend Geoff, Liz and popular girl Frankie to an abandoned underground nuclear fallout shelter, where they decided to stay in order to avoid a school field trip.

While the source of the weapons fire was not immediately clear, it came as the ceasefire appeared to be holding, a rare positive sign in a conflict that has ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. By late Saturday, however, bursts of heavy artillery and machine gun fire replaced the evident calm, a gas station was ablaze and cars carrying injured civilians could be seen on the roads. The warring factions blamed each other for violating the truce. The Russian news agency Itar-Tass late Saturday quoted rebel officials saying that Ukrainian forces continued to shell Donetsk and rebel positions near Mariupol. The RIA Novosti new agency reported that four Donetsk residents were killed in the shelling. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that the situation was calmer than before but that there had been a number of \\"provocations\\" by rebels. These include 10 instances of shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, he said. But Lysenko said a prisoner exchange would begin soon without specifying a time and date. Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Ukrainian militia and separatists of carrying out war crimes. It singled out Russia for a buildup of armor and artillery in eastern Ukraine. \\"All sides in this conflict have shown disregard for civilian lives and are blatantly violating their international obligations,\\" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general, who will travel to Kiev and Moscow in the coming days. \\"Our evidence shows that Russia is fueling the conflict, both through direct interference and by supporting the separatists in the East,\\" Shetty added. \\"Russia must stop the steady flow of weapons and other support to an insurgent force heavily implicated in gross human rights violations.\\" Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels have battled in eastern Ukraine since April, leaving more than 2,200 people dead, according to the United Nations. A truce deal signed Friday after talks in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, went into effect that evening. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the signing of the deal in the Belarusian city of Minsk, Poroshenko's office said Saturday in a statement. The leaders agreed that the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been mostly upheld and they discussed further steps to make the truce last, the office said. After roughly five months of bitter fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebel groups, the question is whether the ceasefire will last. Artillery fire and explosions were heard in the flashpoint city of Donetsk around the time the ceasefire went into effect, the city's website said. But there have been no subsequent reports of major incidents. A CNN team in southeastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and the rebels have engaged in fierce fighting this week between the Ukrainian border town of Novoazovsk and Mariupol, said that artillery fire appeared to have stopped after the start of the truce. Despite the ceasefire deal, Putin remains under international pressure over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Hours after the guns stopped firing, EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Belgium, agreed on a new round of economic sanctions against Russian interests. They are due to be formally adopted on Monday. Russia's Foreign Ministry warned Saturday that if new EU sanctions are imposed, Russia \\"certainly will respond,\\" Russian state-run news agency Itar-Tass reported. Obama expresses support for Ukraine. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was hopeful but skeptical that the ceasefire would hold, questioning whether pro-Russian rebels would adhere to it. Obama, speaking at the end of a NATO summit in Wales, added that NATO was \\"fully united in support of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and ability to defend itself.\\" Member nations would send nonlethal military aid and help modernize Ukraine's security forces, while the United States and European allies finalize measures \\"to deepen and broaden sanctions\\" against Russia, he said. The Ukrainian government and the West accuse Moscow of backing the rebels with arms and troops -- claims that Moscow has repeatedly denied. The conflict has sparked a humanitarian crisis in eastern Ukraine, where homes and infrastructure have been destroyed by shelling. Nationwide, more than a million people have been displaced from their homes by the fighting, most of them in the east. Luhansk city council said that Saturday was the first day in over a month with no shooting. The city office has started working on repairs to the power and water supply. Russia has contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross to express its readiness to deliver a second aid convoy to Ukraine, state news agency RIA Novosti reported Saturday, quoting Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov. \\"We are now discussing the practical details of this operation and expect it to be accomplished,\\" Gatilov is quoted as saying. Gatilov said he could not discuss details but that this time humanitarian aid would be delivered by railroad. The last Russian aid convoy, which entered without Ukraine's permission, was sent by road. Ukraine ready for 'significant steps' Poroshenko said the ceasefire deal was based on his peace plan and an agreement reached in a phone call this week with Putin. \\"We are ready to provide significant steps, including the decentralization of power,\\" he said, as well as greater economic freedoms for the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and guarantees that their culture and language be respected. Many people in eastern Ukraine are Russian speakers. Poroshenko said the exchange of \\"hostages,\\" or prisoners, could begin as soon as Saturday. He said he hoped the ceasefire, based on a 12-point plan, would lead to more substantial talks on core issues and a lasting peace. The talks in Minsk brought together the leaders of the separatist groups with former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, as well as Russia's Ukrainian envoy. The ceasefire, however, does not mean the end of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, separatist leaders said at a televised news conference after signing the deal. Poroshenko has asked his foreign minister and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which already has international observers in Ukraine, to monitor compliance with the ceasefire. A previous unilateral ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian government in June broke down after 10 days. New sanctions planned. Amid skepticism over Russia's intentions, the European Union agreed a fresh round of sanctions Friday against Russian interests, though they are not yet in force. The package includes \\"enhanced measures related to access to capital markets, defense, dual use goods, and sensitive technologies,\\" an EU statement said. It also includes sanctions against the rebel leadership in eastern Ukraine, the government of Crimea, annexed by Russia in March, and Russian decision makers and oligarchs, it said. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton welcomed the ceasefire, adding that it must now be respected by all sides. \\"We hope that this will be a first step toward a sustainable political solution, based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\\" she said. \\"Permanent monitoring of the Russian-Ukrainian border and withdrawal of illegal armed groups and forces illegally operating on Ukrainian territory should be integral parts of such a solution.\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron, who hosted the NATO summit in Wales, said in his final remarks that what Putin was doing is \\"indefensible and wrong\\" and that Russia should face further economic costs. Western countries in July stepped up targeted sanctions against Russia, prompting a retaliatory ban by Moscow on certain imports. Putin has voiced sympathy for the separatists, many of whom are ethnic Russians. But he denies that Russia has armed and trained the rebels, or sent Russian troops over the border.

The supposed perturbation is \\"less butterflies around.\\" Butterflies are insects that play a role in pollination and are a part of the ecosystem. This perturbation is related to ecology and the balance of the environment. 3. The question asks how the perturbation (less butterflies around) would affect the second effect mentioned (more magma coming out of a volcano) if it were to occur. Step-by-step: A. Identify the connection or relationship between the perturbation (less butterflies) and the second effect (more magma coming out of a volcano). B. Assess if the perturbation could have a direct or indirect impact on the process described. C. Judge if the impact would be more, less, or have no effect on the second effect mentioned. Step A: The perturbation (less butterflies) and the second effect (more magma coming out of a volcano) are not directly related, as they belong to different fields of study (ecology and geology, respectively). There is no clear connection between the number of butterflies and the volcanic activity. Step B: Since the perturbation (less butterflies) and the second effect (more magma coming out of a volcano) are not directly connected, it is safe to assume that the perturbation would not have a direct impact on the process described involving the formation of crystals from magma.

Information: - The Posavac Hound ( FCI No. 154 ) ( Croatian : posavski goni ) is a breed of dog , originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type . Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to: - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia.

Answer: It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed by David Edward Hughes around 1880, although this was considered to be induction at the time. Question: who is inventor of the radio Answer:","completion":"The invention of the radio cannot be attributed to a single individual, as it is a result of the collective work and contributions of several inventors and scientists over many years. The development of radio technology was a collaborative effort, with discoveries and inventions from various individuals shaping the way radio functions today. However, some of the central figures who have played significant roles in the invention of radio include: 1. James Clerk Maxwell: A Scottish physicist, Maxwell is known for his development of a set of equations that described the relationship between electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell's Equations. These equations laid the groundwork for the understanding of electromagnetic waves, and eventually, the development of radio communication. 2. Heinrich Hertz: A German physicist, Hertz was the first person to demonstrate that electromagnetic waves could be transmitted through the air. In 1887, he performed a series of experiments validating Maxwell's theories and proved the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz's work laid the foundation for the invention of radio technology. 3. David Edward Hughes: As mentioned in your answer, around 1880, Hughes, a British-American inventor, was likely the first to intentionally transmit a signal using electromagnetic waves. Although his contemporaries at the time considered this to be induction, his work is now recognized as an early precursor to radio transmissions. 4. Guglielmo Marconi: An Italian inventor, Marconi is often referred to as the \\"father of radio.\\" He is known for his pioneering work in long-distance radio transmissions. In 1895, Marconi built a wireless system that was capable of transmitting signals over long distances. He continued to develop and refine his radio technology, resulting in several patents. In 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the first wireless signal across the Atlantic Ocean. 5. Nikola Tesla: A Serbian-American inventor and engineer, Tesla developed several key technologies related to radio. In 1891, he demonstrated wireless energy transmission through electromagnetic waves. Tesla filed a series of patents between 1897 and 1900, which covered the basic components of a radio transmitter and receiver. Unfortunately, Tesla's work on radio technology was overshadowed by Marconi's achievements. 6. Reginald Fessenden: A Canadian-American inventor, Fessenden made significant contributions to the development of radiotelephony. In 1900, he discovered a method called amplitude modulation (AM) that allowed voice to be transmitted wirelessly via radio waves. On Christmas Eve of 1906, Fessenden made history by broadcasting music and speech using a radio transmitter. In conclusion, the invention of radio cannot be attributed to a single individual. While Guglielmo Marconi is often referred to as the inventor of radio due to his significant contributions, it is essential to acknowledge the efforts and work of other inventors such as James Clerk Maxwell, Heinrich Hertz, David Edward Hughes, Nikola Tesla, and Reginald Fessenden, among others. Their collective work and advancements laid the groundwork for the development of radio technology as we know it today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Product review: After a solid opening scene, followed by a promising set-up, \\"Funny Man\\" loses all it's steam with a series of unimaginative murders, surreal settings, and only moderately amusing jokes from the titular character at the expense of his victims. This British answer to Freddy Kruger lacks any suspense, irony, or wit as it seems to be an excuse for whacking a buch of mostly undesireable characters. The ending is somewhat flat, and at this point I felt no vested interest in neither victim nor killer. Not even my appreciation of English humour could really keep my interest. As a huge fan of the macabre, this one really dissapointed me. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses disappointment in various aspects of the movie, \\"Funny Man,\\" and shares their dissatisfaction with the plot progression, character development, and lack of suspense or wit. They describe the murders as unimaginative, the settings as surreal, and the titular character's jokes as only moderately amusing. Furthermore, the reviewer also mentions a lack of interest in both the victim and the killer by the end of the film, which portrays a negative view of the product. Additionally, their mention of being a huge fan of the macabre and the appreciation for English humor further emphasizes their unfulfilled expectations and reinforces the unflattering depiction of the movie."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what nationality was andy williams?\\" Answer:","completion":"Andy Williams was American."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The United States and Mexico indeed have different demographic compositions, and the reasons for this are deeply rooted in their distinct histories, geographies, and social factors. While the United States does have a diverse population, it is not as mixed as Mexico's. There are several reasons for this: 1. Indigenous Populations: At the time of the European arrival, Mexico had a large and diverse population of indigenous peoples. These indigenous populations from various tribes and cultures have contributed significantly to Mexico's mixed population throughout the centuries. In contrast, when Europeans arrived in the United States, there were also various tribes, but they constituted a smaller, less diverse population than in Mexico. 2. Colonization: Spain colonized Mexico, and Spanish colonial policies favored intermarriage and mixing between Europeans and indigenous peoples, resulting in the mestizo (mixed-race) population that is now common throughout Mexico and many other Latin American countries. In contrast, British colonial policies in the United States emphasized keeping European and indigenous populations separate, thus limiting the degree of mixing and integration. 3. Immigration: The United States has been a destination for immigrants from all over the world, leading to a diverse but less mixed population due to a greater emphasis on maintaining cultural and ethnic distinctiveness. In Mexico, immigration has been less significant, with most of the population being derived from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Spanish settlers. Regarding the acquisition of land, the United States acquired significant amounts of land from Mexico through war, negotiation, and annexation. The Mexican-American War (1846-1848) was the primary means by which the United States acquired much of the Mexican territory, which constitutes the present-day states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and portions of Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, and Oklahoma. The war began due to various factors, including American expansionism and the ideology of Manifest Destiny, disputes over the Texas-Mexico border, and political instability in Mexico. The conflict eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war and ceded those territories to the United States in exchange for a payment of 15 million to Mexico and the assumption of approximately 3.25 million in Mexican debt owed to American citizens. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other; they address separate but related topics. The first question asks about the reasons for the differences in population composition between the United States and Mexico, while the second question focuses on the historical events surrounding the acquisition of Mexican land by the United States. While they both involve historical aspects of the relationship between the two countries, they are distinct questions and cannot be considered paraphrases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The truck slipped crossing the bridge but the car held on fine, although the [1]. truck had better traction.. [2]. car had better traction..","completion":"driver was tense throughout the experience. The difference in performance between the two vehicles was quite noticeable. The primary factors contributing to this difference included: [1]. The truck's tires were made for off-roading, providing it with better traction on more challenging surfaces. However, the wet and slippery bridge posed a significant challenge for the truck. Despite having excellent grip on uneven terrain, the truck's tires weren't designed to handle the slippery surface well. [2]. In contrast, the car's tires were designed with road use in mind, providing better traction on wet and slippery surfaces. While the car's tires may struggle on extremely rough terrain, they performed admirably on the slick bridge. This allowed the car to maintain a better grip on the road and prevent slipping. The drivers of both vehicles took this experience as a valuable lesson in understanding the importance of having the right tires for the specific conditions they would encounter. They also learned that a vehicle's traction isn't solely determined by the make or model, but also by the type and condition of its tires. In the future, both drivers planned to invest in suitable tires for their vehicles to ensure they could safely handle various driving conditions. They also understood the importance of proper tire maintenance, such as regularly checking the tire pressure and tread depth. Overall, this incident illustrated the impact that vehicles' traction can have on driving safety and performance. By making smart choices regarding tire selection and maintenance, drivers can minimize the risks associated with challenging driving conditions and protect themselves and their passengers on the road."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: CONTEXT: 22 de noviembre de 2018 El lunes, la empresa dedicada a la oferta de alojamientos a particulares y turísticos Airbnb anunció sus intenciones de retirar sus ofertas de alojamiento en los asentamientos israelíes en Cisjordania. La decisión afectaría cerca de 200 propiedades dentro de los próximos días. La compañía indicó que se tomó la decisión debido a la controversia en torno a los asentamientos, a los que describió como \\"el centro del conflicto entre israelíes y palestinos\\". Asimismo, indicó que \\"las leyes estadounidenses permiten a empresas, como Airbnb, hacer negocios en esos territorios. Al mismo tiempo, muchos miembros de la comunidad global han asegurado que las compañías no deberían hacer negocios allí dado que consideran no deberían beneficiarse de tierras en donde las personas han sido desplazadas\\". Activistas por los derechos humanos y autoridades palestinas, críticos de las ofertas de alojamiento de Airbnb en Cisjordania por varios años, elogiaron la decisión. Por su parte, los líderes israelíes criticaron a la compañía y apoyaron iniciar acciones legales en su contra en las cortes estadounidenses. El Ministerio de Turismo de Israel señaló que actuaría para limitar la actividad de Airbnb en el país.

Article: Recently, another study has been carried out about who is the greatest American president. Sixty-five presidential historians took part in it and they judged the past forty-two American leaders based on ten qualities of leadership, which include public persuasion, crisis leadership, the management of economy, moral leadership and international relations. The historians also looked at administrative ability, relations with Congress, goal setting and pursuit of equal justice for all. Finally, the experts considered performance based on the historical period in which the president lived. The historians chose Abraham Lincoln as America's greatest president. He had also been named best president in a similar study in 2000. Abraham Lincoln was the only president in American history to lead the nation during the Civil War in the 1860s. He united the nation at last. And he took the first steps that destroyed the institution of slavery in America. Edna Medford is a professor of history at Howard University in Washington, D.C. She was an adviser on this study and the earlier one. She says Abraham Lincoln is seen to represent the values that the nation most honors like truthfulness, moderation and respect for human rights. The historians named America's first president, George Washington, as second on the list of greatest presidents. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman are next in that order. John F. Kennedy, the country's first Roman Catholic president, is sixth on the list. Like Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy was murdered while in office. Among recent presidents, Ronald Reagan was named the tenth best president. Bill Clinton was rated fifteenth. And the historians rated former president George W. Bush as number thirty-six. His father, George H.W. Bush, did much better. He was rated as number eighteen.

Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia. Special Branch suspected a political element to the crime based on Salnish's involvement, but as both Helfeld and Lepidus died during the chase, the motivation for the crime...

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Yes, the narrative provides a complex set of circumstances that ultimately influenced Al Qaeda's move from being a relatively inactive group to becoming a major operational force in 1998. Here are a few clarifying questions: 1. Explaining Sudan's Shift: How exactly did the Sudanese regime's changing alliances affect Bin Laden and Al Qaeda? It's clear that a succession of events led Bashir to displace Turabi's supporters, but how immediately and severely did this impact Bin Laden's operations? 2. Bin Laden's Finance: Could you elaborate on the nature of Bin Laden's financial struggles during this time? What were the main expenditures that he had to cut back? 3. Role of Other Middle Eastern Governments: The text mentions other governments from Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Libya putting pressure on Sudan. Could you expound more on the unique roles these countries played and how their pressures manifested? 4. Bin Laden and Libya: Bin Laden had to ask the Libyans associated with his Islamic army to leave Sudan. Could you elaborate more on the relationship Bin Laden had with the Libyans and why this provoked such a strong backlash? 5. UN Security Council's Role: What were the specific sanctions the UN Security Council placed on Khartoum in April 1996, and how did they contribute to the environment that pushed Bin Laden to act? 6. Global Economic Strains: You mentioned 'strains in the world economy' that affected Sudan's currency, and consequently, Bin Laden's finances.

Impact on Al Qaeda's Membership: How did these financial constraints and the shift in Bin Laden's base from Sudan impact the overall morale and membership dynamics within the group?

Given the following context: By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup. On the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Munich Context: A scene from the film representing the Mossad team from 1972. From left to right: Avner Kaufman, Robert, Carl, Hans and Steve. Munich begins with a depiction of the events of the 1972 Munich Olympics and then cuts to the home of Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir, where Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent of German-Jewish descent, is chosen to lead an assassination mission against 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. To give the Israeli government plausible deniability and at the direction of his handler Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), Avner resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve (Daniel Craig), Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), former Israeli soldier and \\"cleaner\\" Carl (CiarÃ¡n Hinds), and a Danish document forger named Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are given information by a shadowy French informant, Louis (Mathieu Amalric). In Rome, the team shoots and kills Wael Zwaiter, who is broke and living as a poet. In Paris, they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in Cyprus, they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commandos, they pursue three Palestinians to BeirutâMuhammad Youssef al-Najjar; Kamal Adwan; and Kamal Nasser, a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) spokesmanâpenetrating the Palestinians' guarded compound and killing all three. Between hits, the often-reluctant assassins argue about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby.

In this scene, Avner is furious and concerned about the safety of his family, fearing that their lives might be in danger due to his involvement in the assassination mission. The Consulate serves as a representation of the Israeli government, and it is within this location that Avner confronts his superiors about their actions and responsibilities towards his family, though he ultimately gets thrown out as a result of his aggressive and demanding behavior. This moment in the film highlights the tension and personal sacrifices made by Avner in pursuing his missions, as well as the emotional toll it takes on him and his relationships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most were shot down by American combat air patrols, and no damage was done to the U.S. ships. A few Japanese planes survived and made their way to land bases on Luzon. During the night, Halsey had passed tactical command of TF 38 to Admiral Mitscher, who ordered the American carrier groups to launch their first strike wave, of 180 aircraft, at dawn—before the Northern Force had been located. When the search aircraft made contact at 07:10, this strike wave was orbiting ahead of the task force. At 08:00, as the attack went in, its escorting fighters destroyed Ozawa's combat air patrol of about 30 planes. The U.S. air strikes continued until the evening, by which time TF 38 had flown 527 sorties against the Northern Force, sinking Zuikaku, the light carriers Chitose and Zuihō, and the destroyer Akizuki, all with heavy loss of life.

The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla.

Question: Given the below context: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Write an article based on this summary: An advert for car parking at Gatwick Airport has been banned after a complaint that vehicles were being parked on local roads instead of in a secure compound.","completion":"Title: Unethical Gatwick Airport Parking: Banned Advert Reveals Misleading Practices that Put Vehicles at Risk Introduction A recent advert for car parking at London’s Gatwick Airport stirred controversy and has been banned following a complaint that the advertised service misled customers by claiming vehicles were parked in a secure compound while, in reality, they were on local public roads. This article will examine the details surrounding the ban and delve into the potential security issues and negative repercussions for both customers and local residents that such deceptive practices can create. Investigating the Deceptive Advert The banned advert featured a service that provided car parking facilities for travelers using Gatwick Airport. These facilities were advertised as secure and convenient for passengers, reducing the stress and hassle of airport travel. However, a customer filed a complaint after discovering that, contrary to the claims made in the advertisement, their vehicle had been left parked on a local road rather than in the secure compound as promised. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) intervened, investigating the matter and determining that the advert was misleading and in breach of the UK advertising code. As a result, the advert has been banned. Implications for Customers Travelers who park their vehicles at airports often do so under the assumption that their cars will be safe for the duration of their trip. The advertised services should be reliable and reflect the reality of the service offered. When an airport parking company fails to deliver on their promises, it not only puts customers' vehicles at risk but also erodes trust in the industry as a whole. Vehicles parked on public roads are generally more vulnerable to theft, vandalism, and potential damage from traffic incidents. Longer stays increase the likelihood of these issues arising, putting travelers at risk of financial and emotional distress upon their return to find their vehicle damaged or missing. The additional stress of dealing with insurance claims or police reports further exacerbates the situation, creating a negative experience that passengers would ideally want to avoid. Deceptive advertising practices manipulate customers into a false sense of security, ultimately damaging the relationship between the service provider and consumers. Impact on Local Residents Gatwick Airport's parking issue not only affects customers but also poses challenges for local residents. Cars parked on public roads can lead to congestion on streets, making it difficult for people to navigate their daily commutes or access their homes. Furthermore, vehicles occupying parking spots near residential areas can create obstacles for residents, who may struggle to find parking spaces close to their property. The increased presence of parked cars on local roads also increases the likelihood of disputes between neighbors, as residents are forced to compete for limited parking spaces. This situation can foster tensions, lower the overall quality of life in the community, and put unnecessary pressure on local law enforcement and parking management authorities. Conclusion The ban on the misleading Gatwick Airport parking advert serves as a stark reminder of the importance of transparent communication between service providers and customers. It is imperative for airport parking companies to uphold ethical practices, ensuring that the services they advertise accurately represent what is actually provided to travelers. Customers must be extra cautious when choosing airport parking services by researching, reading reviews, and considering multiple providers before making a decision. At the same time, airport authorities and regulators must be vigilant and proactive in ensuring that service providers adhere to advertising codes and prioritize customer safety and satisfaction above all else. The consequences of deceptive advertising practices, such as the one exposed in this case, are far-reaching and bear negative implications both for consumers and local communities. By cracking down on such unethical practices, regulatory bodies like the ASA, airport authorities, and the broader public can make significant strides in promoting transparency, trust, safety, and well-being for all concerned parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: A). no B). yes","completion":"A) no These two questions are inquiring about different information. To provide more context, I will answer both questions individually: 1) What is VECTOR/CAN tool? Vector Informatik, a German technology company, develops tools and software for embedded systems. The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a protocol facilitating communication between various devices in a vehicle. Vector CAN tools are designed to provide support for networking and electronics development, including interfaces, software, and other tools to handle protocol and analyze data. Vector CAN tools include: a) CANoe: A development, simulation, and testing software that allows engineers to design, analyze, and verify the network communication of CAN-based systems efficiently. b) CANalyzer: A comprehensive software tool to monitor, analyze, and simulate CAN networks. c) Vector Hardware Interfaces: These tools, such as the VN1600, VN3600, and VN7600, are used to connect PCs to CAN networks, enabling developers to log and simulate CAN messages effectively. d) CANdb: A database editor to create, modify, and manage CAN databases containing message and signal definitions, primarily for exchanging data between development tools. These tools support automotive engineers and developers throughout the entire vehicle development process, from initial design and development stages to troubleshooting in live vehicle systems. 2) What is a vector? In mathematics and physics, a vector is a quantity which has both magnitude (size) and direction. Vectors are typically represented by arrows, where the length denotes the magnitude and the arrowhead points to the direction. Vectors can be represented in various forms, for instance, in Cartesian coordinates (x, y), polar coordinates (r, θ), or as a column matrix. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, where both the size and direction play crucial roles in understanding and calculating their effects in various situations. Vectors can be manipulated using arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, scaling, and dot and cross products. Analyzing and computing vector operations is a fundamental aspect of subjects such as linear algebra, physics, engineering, and computer graphics. In conclusion, the first question is about VECTOR/CAN tools, which refer to embedded system tools and communication protocols for vehicle system development. In contrast, the second question focuses on vectors as mathematical objects representing quantities with magnitude and direction. These two questions inquire about different information, making option A) the correct choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case, which suggests a higher demand for goods, does not have a direct effect on the process of air reaching the air sacs in the lungs. The process of breathing and oxygen transport in the body is a physiological function that is not directly influenced by economic factors, such as the demand for goods. However, an indirect effect could be observed if the higher demand for goods leads to increased industrial activity and air pollution. Poor air quality may result in reduced lung function and make it harder for the alveoli to effectively take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. In this case, the higher demand for goods could indirectly affect the efficiency of the physiological process of respiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A modified version of the Hawker Woodcock, the Hawker DANKOK, was initially delivered from the UK while a following series of 12 aircraft were license-built by the Orlogsværft. In 1928 the naval air service procures six Heinkel HE 8 floatplanes, with another 16 to be license-built by the Orlogsværft. As Germany were not allowed to produce military aircraft, the planes were labelled as mail planes, but they could easily be refitted with dual machine guns, radio equipment and a capacity for eight bombs. The Heinkel had an unexpected arctic employment in the early 1930s when a dispute over East Greenland caused the first deployment of aircraft at Greenland along with three naval ships. Following the settlement of the dispute between Denmark and Norway the Heinkels were used in the efforts to map the frontiers of the island. In 1933, two Hawker Nimrod were acquired to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology of naval aircraft in the interwar period. A further ten planes were to be produced under licence at the Orlogsværft. The new aircraft made the air base in Ringsted inadequate and the naval air service were moved to the Avnø peninsula at southern Zealand.

Which township is experiencing fewer tornadoes? Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side, has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude. Hint: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A rising population is one of the main reasons that there is global warming. Between 1650 and 1850 the population increased by 0.75 billion people going from 0.25 billion to one billion. From 1930 to the end of the century the population rose from two billion to over six billion. In just a third of the time the population rose by more than five times what it did before. It is expected that this trend in the changing population will continue and could even heighten. The growing population requires increasing amounts of energy. These energy demands and other supplies require production, which almost always involves the emission of greenhouse gases. The more the population increases the more greenhouse gases that are produced and the greater the increase in temperature. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the best-known causes for global warming. The major reason for fossil fuels contributing so much to global warming is the release of carbon that occurs during the burning of fossil fuels. When people burn fossil fuels, they release large amounts of carbon by way of the release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air then leads to global warming. Another source of carbon dioxide comes from _ . In forests there is a large amount of carbon that is stored in the trees and other plants. This carbon is out of the atmosphere because the trees consume the carbon from carbon dioxide. When people cut down trees, they are frequently burned. This burning releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that was stored in organic matter. Even when new trees are planted, it can take up to one hundred years to make up for the carbon that was released. It is commonly thought that because trees absorb more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere experiences positive effects. Sophie Armstrong, the writer of Earth Care put it, \\"There's no doubt that the earth is becoming warmer because of human activity rather than a random but natural phenomenon. Options: A Economy.

It is supported by the context, indicating that the rise in population drives more energy demands and production. These processes have subsequent effects on the environment and typically involve the release of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. Therefore, the correct answer among the provided options 'Economy', 'Art', 'Environment', and 'Health' is 'Environment.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Throughout his career, Caxés was commissioned to create major works for churches, convents, and nobility across Spain and Europe. Some of his famous works include the altarpiece for the Church of San Millán in Segovia, the Altarpiece of St. James in the Cathedral of Plasencia, and the Last Judgment in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid. In addition to his paintings, Patricio Caxés was also known for his artistic abilities as a sculptor. His sculptures demonstrated his ability to create lifelike figures and his attention to detail in each piece. Although not as prolific in this medium as he was in painting, Caxés' sculptures are also notable examples of the Baroque and Mannerist styles in Spanish sculpture.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands? , can you please find it? With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\"","completion":"The article does not provide a full name of a specific person who is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands.

Write some highlights for the following article: Short bursts of exercise lasting less than 10 minutes give you the same health benefits as slugging it out at the gym for hours. Researchers have found that even walking to the bus stop or cleaning your home can help you lose weight and lower your cholesterol. Activities like mowing the lawn and even fishing can also lower your risk of heart disease. Healthy: The Boston University study found that short bursts of exercise, including household tasks such as cleaning and mowing the grass, can be as healthy as more lengthy exercise. A Boston University study found that so long as the 10 minute bursts make up your daily quota of exercise, you will see the difference on your body. It concluded that ‘some exercise is better than nothing’ and that by adding up the small things you can have big impact. For the experiment the researchers attached a motion detector to to 2,109 men and woman with an average age of 47. More than half were overweight. The sensor - called an accelerometer - allowed them to monitor all their activity, rather than asking them to fill out a questionnaire in which they might not have listed everything they did. The results showed that compared to those who did not do enough exercise, everyone who did so weighed less, had lower BMI and lower cholesterol. Exercising had a stronger impact on cardiovascular risk factors in women than men, possibly because of physiological differences or unmeasured factors. But significantly, the benefits of short bursts of less than 10 minutes yielded the same benefits as those who worked out for longer. Examples of activities which counted included everything from cleaning the garage to badminton and golf. Similar: The study found that short bursts of activity yielded the same benefits as longer workouts. More strenuous activities like hiking, jogging, shovelling counted too. The researchers said the findings may work as an encouragement to those who do not have enough time to work out - or cannot muster the energy to do so after a long day. According to NHS guidelines, adults should get at least two hours and 30 minutes or moderate intensity exercise a week, such as fast walking, or 75 minutes of high intensity exercise such as swimming. The two may be mixed together if a person so chooses, so long as they hit the target. Lead Researcher Professor Nicole Glazer of Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘I think it’s really important finding - because of the high levels of sedentary behaviour it is crucial to get people to be more active. ‘Going to the gym is not the only thing you can do and things like taking the stairs and walking for the bus do add up. ‘It’s important to exercise even if you do not have time to do so, and you can fit it into your day’.

Intellectual property Criticism of the term intellectual property ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like property and rights in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc. Q: Which term is criticized as vague?","completion":"The term \\"intellectual property\\" is criticized as vague and abstract, as it is often used in a way that contradicts practical use and law. Critics argue that the term can be misleading and overly broad, hindering intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of various areas, such as copyright, patents, and trademarks. The concept of intellectual property encompasses a wide range of legal protections for intangible assets, and this umbrella term can sometimes create confusion and obscure the unique characteristics of each individual area within the field. Some of the reasons for the criticism regarding the term \\"intellectual property\\" are as follows: 1. Vagueness and abstract nature: Critics argue that the term \\"intellectual property\\" does not accurately define the multitude of protections and rights that exist for intangible assets. The abstract nature of the term makes it harder to discuss and debate specific policy issues related to intellectual property. 2. Overreach: The term \\"intellectual property\\" may be used by certain parties to advance their interests by extending the scope of protection to areas that should not necessarily fall under the same umbrella. This can lead to misinterpretation and the over-application of protections. 3. Semantic validity: Critics question the semantic validity of using terms like \\"property\\" and \\"rights\\" in the context of intellectual property law. They argue that applying the idea of tangible property rights to intangible assets is not always appropriate and can lead to inconsistencies in the law. 4. Potential for abuse: The broad and vague nature of the term \\"intellectual property\\" can make it easier for parties with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo to manipulate the law or regulations in their favor, ultimately preventing reforms that may benefit the public interest. 5. Obfuscation of distinct legal areas: By lumping together different aspects of intellectual property, such as copyright, patents, and trademarks, the term \\"intellectual property\\" can make it difficult to differentiate between these distinct legal areas and to address the unique challenges they pose individually. In conclusion, the term \\"intellectual property\\" has been criticized for its vagueness, abstract overreach, and semantic issues. This criticism highlights the need for a more precise and nuanced language when discussing the unique aspects and challenges of intellectual property law, in order to promote meaningful dialogue and better policy decisions that serve the public interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to keep cooked broccoli bright green Be careful not to steam green vegetables. Green vegetables contain chlorophyll, when chlorophyll is cooked, it produces carbon dioxide. Since you have to cover the vegetables to steam them, the chlorophyll turns a drab, grayish color. Pick your answer from: 1). Do not steam green vegetables if you live in a climate with conditions affected by cold. Cut your broccoli into pieces if you have any greens on your salads and pack them into a steaming bowl.; 2). Let the broccoli stand in the steam room for thirty minutes. The broccoli should start emitting a green color in approximately one week.; 3). You can prevent this by boiling the greens, in salted water. Use a large amount of water, then add salt.; 4). This will affect how bright and impressive your broccoli will be. Make your own broccoli sauce.;","completion":"3). You can prevent this by boiling the greens, in salted water. Use a large amount of water, then add salt. To keep cooked broccoli bright green, follow these steps: 1. Prepare a large pot of water, making sure there's enough water to fully submerge the broccoli. 2. Bring the water to a boil and add salt to the boiling water. The salt will help preserve the green color by partially breaking down the cell walls, which allows the gas to escape more easily. 3. Wash and cut the broccoli into equal-sized florets. 4. Add the broccoli to the boiling water, making sure all the florets are immersed. 5. Cook the broccoli for about 1-3 minutes or until the desired tenderness is reached. Do not overcook, as this could lead to a dull color and a mushy texture. 6. Prepare an ice bath (a large bowl filled with ice and water). Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli from the boiling water to the ice bath to stop the cooking process immediately. This step is called blanching and helps to maintain the bright green color by halting enzyme action that can cause discoloration. 7. Once the broccoli is cooled in the ice bath, drain it well and pat dry with a paper towel. This process retains the bright green color of the broccoli."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb. Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attache, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted. Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife.

He is of German, Swiss-German, English, Scottish, and distant Dutch and French descent. Growing up, Lucas had a passion for cars and motor racing, which later inspired his films 1:42.08 and American Graffiti. Long before Lucas became obsessed with filmmaking, he yearned to be a race-car driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages. In 1969, Lucas married film editor Marcia Lou Griffin, who went on to win an Academy Award for her editing work on the original Star Wars film. They adopted a daughter, Amanda Lucas, in 1981, and divorced in 1983. Lucas subsequently adopted two more children as a single parent: daughter Katie Lucas, born in 1988, and son Jett Lucas, born in 1993. His three eldest children all appeared in the three Star Wars prequels, as did Lucas himself. Following his divorce, Lucas was in a relationship with singer Linda Ronstadt in the 1980s. Lucas began dating Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments and chair of DreamWorks Animation, in 2006. Lucas and Hobson announced their engagement in January 2013, and married on June 22, 2013, at Lucas's Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California. They have one daughter together, Everest Hobson Lucas, who was born via gestational carrier on August 12, 2013. Lucas was born and raised in a Methodist family. The religious and mythical themes in Star Wars were inspired by Lucas's interest in the writings of mythologist Joseph Campbell, and he would eventually come to identify strongly with the Eastern religious philosophies he studied and incorporated into his films, which were a major inspiration for \\"the Force\\". Lucas has come to state that his religion is \\"Buddhist Methodist\\". He resides in Marin County. Lucas is a major collector of the American illustrator and painter Norman Rockwell.

It is essential for men to listen actively and attentively, show empathy, and make an effort to understand their partner's perspective. 2. Equality: Women desire respect and equal treatment in relationships, the workplace, and society at large. Recognizing and dismantling unconscious biases and gender stereotypes is crucial for achieving genuine equality and understanding between the sexes. 3. Emotional support: Just as men need to be emotionally supported, so do women. Women may wish men were more willing to provide a listening ear, emotional encouragement, and validation without trying to solve or minimize the issue at hand immediately. 4. Appreciation: Women often wish men would express their appreciation more frequently, whether it's for the seemingly little things or the more significant gestures in a relationship. Demonstrating gratitude can help strengthen emotional connections and make both partners feel more valued. 5. Romantic gestures: While it's not necessary to shower a woman with extravagant gifts or make grand gestures daily, women appreciate the occasional, thoughtful romantic effort. Such actions show that a man is genuinely invested in the relationship and willing to put in the effort to maintain a loving and nurturing dynamic. What parenting fact did you wish you knew? While every parenting journey is unique, several universal experiences and challenges can come up for many parents. Here are a few parenting facts that some might wish they knew ahead of time: 1. Learning curve: Parenting is a constant learning experience, and it's essential to understand that no one has all the answers right away. Seasoned parents and first-timers alike encounter challenges and obstacles that require patience, understanding, and humility. 2. Every child is different: Just because one parenting technique works for one child doesn't mean it will work for another. Each child has their own unique personality, needs, and preferences. It's important to adapt your parenting style to suit each individual child. 3. Self-care is essential: Many parents tend to neglect their own well-being in their pursuit of being the best caregiver for their children. When you take care of yourself– mentally, emotionally, and physically – you're better equipped to handle the demands of parenting. 4. There's no perfect balance: Striving for the perfect balance between work, parenting, and personal life can be stressful and unrealistic. Recognize that priorities will shift throughout life, and it's more beneficial to aim for a sustainable, flexible equilibrium. 5. Trust your instincts: While advice from books, experts, and fellow parents is invaluable, it's also essential to trust your parental instincts. Every family dynamic and situation is unique, and only you can determine the best course of action for your family. 6. Growth and change: As children grow and develop, so too must your parenting strategies. What was once effective may no longer work as your child enters new stages of life. Embrace the change and keep an open mind to adapt and evolve as a parent. In summary, although both questions touch upon the topic of understanding and knowledge, they are not the same question. The first question delves into the wishes and desires of women in their relationships with men, while the second focuses on parenting challenges and insights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When was Burke contacted for more writings? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

Article: The English language is the result of the invasion of the island of Britain over many hundreds of years.The first invasions were by a people called Angles about 1, 500 years ago. The Angles were a German tribe who crossed the English Channel . Later two more groups crossed to Britain. They were the Saxons and the Jutes. Through many years, the Saxons, Angles and the Jutes mixed their different languages. The result is what is called Anglo-Saxon or old English. The next great invasion of Britain was done by Vikings about 1, 100 years ago. Many English words used today come from these ancient Vikings. The next invasion of Britain took place more than 900 years ago, in 1066. History experts call this invasion the Norman Conquest. The Normans were a French-speaking people from Normandy in the north of France. These new rulers spoke only French for several hundred years. It was the most important language in the world at that time. It was the language of educated people. But the common people of Britain still spoke old English. Old English took many words from the Norman French. Some of these include \\"damage\\", \\"prison\\", and \\"marriage\\". The French language used by the Norman rulers greatly changed the way English was spoken 800 years ago. English became what language experts call Middle English. Middle English sounds like Modern English. But it is difficult to understand now. The history of the English language continues as Middle English becomes Modern English, which is spoken today.

Question: What's the name of the man who Brenner claims has been rescued three weeks previously? Movie title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company. Brenner calls back and...
