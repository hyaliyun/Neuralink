Here is a premise: The private savings necessary to finance the deficit will plummet, because there will be net withdrawals from private pension funds. Here is a hypothesis: The deficit is financed by private savings. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To assess if the hypothesis can be confirmed based on the given premise, it's important to examine the relationships and underlying assumptions that connect the premise to the hypothesis. Let us analyze both the premise and the hypothesis step by step to understand the reasoning behind them. Premise: \\"The private savings necessary to finance the deficit will plummet, because there will be net withdrawals from private pension funds.\\" This premise establishes two critical components: 1. The deficit is being financed, at least partially, by private savings. 2. Due to net withdrawals from private pension funds, the available amount within these private savings set to plummet, negatively impacting the financing of the deficit. Hypothesis: \\"The deficit is financed by private savings.\\" The hypothesis asserts that the deficit is financed by private savings, which is in line with the first component of the premise. Now that we understand the premise and the hypothesis, let's determine if it's possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. Based on the analysis above, it is evident that the first component of the premise and the hypothesis actually share the same claim: that the deficit is being financed by private savings. Given this information, we can conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. However, it is important to acknowledge the limits of this analysis and keep in mind some potential factors that may influence the relationships between the different components in the premise and the hypothesis: 1. The extent to which the deficit is financed by private savings: While the premise states that private savings are a source of financing for the deficit, it doesn’t provide information about what portion of the total deficit is being financed by private savings. If private savings serve as a minor contributor to financing the deficit, a reduction in the available funds might not necessarily pose a significant impact on the overall deficit financing. 2. Alternative sources for deficit financing: The premise does not mention or exclude other potential sources of financing for the deficit, such as public savings, taxation, or borrowing. If alternative sources of financing are available, they might compensate for the decrease in private savings, reducing the impact of the decline in these funds. In conclusion, based on the available information, it appears that if the premise is true, it is possible to confirm the hypothesis as it shares the same claim regarding deficit financing by private savings. Nonetheless, it's crucial to consider the limits of this analysis and other potential factors that could affect the relationship between private savings and deficit financing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Seth takes credit for Memetics Review: I picked this book up to see if there were any new ideas under the sun. At first I read along hoping to see some original thought on marketing ideas. I quickly realized I had heard of this 'ideavirus' concept before, only it was called memes before.The book makes a very sloppy stab at translating the science of Memetics into a 'revolutionary' marketing strategy. This would be fine had it succeeded. A workable introduction into the marketing implication of Memetics would be a very valuable tool to anyone trying to propogate an idea. However this book fails in accomplishing that goal. As it stands the book simply creates a feeble representation of Memetics, rebrands it as the 'ideavirus' and proclaims the author as head of a revolutionary new marketing technology.I started hoping to find some new ideas under the sun. This was not to be. The book earned its place, and that place is where the sun don't shine. Answer: A:","completion":"No, this product review is not positive.

Article: Australian cities can keep their native wildlife -- but only if they can kick their habit of urban sprawl . That's the finding of a new study by leading Australian environmental researchers Jessica Sushinsky, Professor Hugh Possingham and Dr Richard Fuller of The University of Queensland. \\"While urban development usually reduces the number of birds in a city, building more compact cities and avoiding urban sprawl can slow these reductions greatly,\\" says lead author Jessica Sushinsky. \\"Compact housing development leaves birds' homes untouched, leading to fewer losses of birds.\\" The researchers surveyed native and wild birds in Brisbane's urban areas, including living and industrial areas, public parks and gardens, major roadways and airports. They then used statistical modeling to find out what will happen to the birds as the city grows. The first setting was compact growth -- where multiple homes are built on land that previously had only one house. The second setting was sprawling growth -- a familiar pattern where homes are built here and there beyond the city's current boundaries. The team's forecasts showed that a much greater diversity of species was lost over 20 years in the sprawling setting compared to the more compact setting. \\"Urban sprawl resulted in the disappearance of many urban-sensitive birds -- birds that only live in areas where there is native vegetation , such as parklands and woodlands,\\" Ms Sushinsky says. \\"On the other hand, we found the city with the compact development attracted more birds because it kept more of its parks and green areas.\\" Now the Queensland Government has adopted the more compact urban growth strategy, which, Dr Richard Fuller says, is good news for Australia's native birds. These birds are environmental specialists -- they need a particular environment to do well. \\"While compact development means smaller backyards, it can also make our entire cities more biodiverse,\\" according to Dr Fuller. \\"The study shows that we should hold on to our green spaces instead of...

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Question: Where is John's hilltop villa? Movie plot title: To Catch a Thief Movie plot: \\"The Cat\\" is John Robie (Cary Grant). Now a respectable and well-to-do grower of grapes and flowers on the French Riviera, before World War II he was a jewel thief -- a cat burglar -- who was imprisoned but granted parole so he could fight the Germans. Someone is using the Cat's M.O. to steal jewelry again, and the police think Robie must be involved. When they visit his handsome stone villa to take him in for questioning, he gives them the slip with help from his housekeeper Germaine (Georgette Anys), who leads the cops on a car chase while Robie catches the bus.He drops in on his old gang from the French Resistance, a group of ex-cons whose war work, like Robie's own, led to grants of parole that depend on keeping their noses clean. Restaurant manager Bertani (Charles Vanel), wine steward Foussard (Jean Martinelli), and the others are all under a cloud while the Cat is at large, and they blame Robie. Still, when the police arrive at Bertani's restaurant, Foussard's teenaged daughter Danielle (Brigitte Auber), who has apparently enjoyed flirting with Robie in the past, spirits him across the bay in a motorboat to the safety of a Cannes beach club.Robie enlists the aid of an insurance man of Bertani's acquaintance, H.H. Hughson (John Williams) of Lloyds of London, in order to prove his innocence. Robie's plan is to catch the new cat burglar in the act. To do this, he obtains a list of the most expensive jewels on the Riviera from the reluctant Hughson. The first name on the list is Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who is traveling with her daughter Francie (Grace Kelly). Robie strikes up an acquaintance with them -- one met with delight by Jessie, a pretense of modesty by Francie, and claws-baring jealousy from Danielle.Francie is not afraid of a little fun. Although she sees through Robie's cover as an American industrialist, the considerable charms of this thief are worth catching.

Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. Which group would be able to hear lower frequency, group A or group B? Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. A:","completion":"Group A would be able to hear lower frequency sounds compared to group B. This is because group A consists of animals that can only hear infrasound, which are sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz. On the other hand, group B consists of animals that can hear the same frequency range as humans, which is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Since infrasound frequencies are lower than the human hearing range, group A animals are specialized in detecting lower frequency sounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we have to do the subtraction part: 53 - 59. Imagine you have 53 candies, and someone takes away 59 candies. You don't have enough candies, so you will be left with -6 candies. (Because they took 6 more candies than you had.) Now, the equation will look like this: -6 = 2 * o The next step is to find out how many \\"2's\\" you need to get -6.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance.

With more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm is the most densely populated county of Sweden. - The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make implements with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 3.4 million years, and ended between 8700 BCE and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Stockholm City Centre (\\"Stockholms innerstad\\", \\"Innerstaden\\", \\"Inre staden\\") is the city centre of Stockholm in Sweden. The entire city of Stockholm is also the centre of the Stockholm Metropolitan Area. - T-Centralen (Swedish for \\"The T-Central\\"; T being an abbreviation for \\"tunnelbana\\", the Swedish word for \\"underground\\" or \\"subway\\") is a metro station that forms the heart of the Stockholm metro system, in the sense that it is the only station where all three of the system's lines meet.

Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance. - The Stockholm metro (literally: \\"Stockholm's Tunnel Rail\\") is a metro system in Stockholm, Sweden.

Premise: \\"The best view of the whole citadel can be had from the terrace of the Jaisal Castle Hotel.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The best view of the citadel is from a government building.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"The best view of the whole citadel can be had from the terrace of the Jaisal Castle Hotel\\" is true, then this tells us that the best viewpoint to admire the citadel is indeed the terrace of the Jaisal Castle Hotel. In this situation, we are given information about the location from which an optimal view of the citadel can be enjoyed and this location is a specific hotel. However, the hypothesis that \\"The best view of the citadel is from a government building\\" presents an alternative viewpoint, suggesting that the best view is to be found at a government building. Since the given premise specifies that the Jaisal Castle Hotel offers the best view, and the hypothesis proposes a different location (i.e., a government building), the hypothesis contradicts the original premise. It's essential to note that the premise and the hypothesis refer to two different types of buildings, one being a hotel and the other a government building. The fact that the Jaisal Castle Hotel is assumed to have the best view clearly does not correspond with the hypothesis that a government building would offer the best view. Therefore, if the premise is true, the hypothesis cannot be true simultaneously. In conclusion, if we accept the given premise that the terrace of Jaisal Castle Hotel offers the best view of the citadel as true, then it entails that the hypothesis \\"The best view of the citadel is from a government building\\" is false. The two propositions are mutually exclusive because they assert that the best view is available at different types of locations, and as per the premise, the optimal vantage point is the Jaisal Castle Hotel, not a government building."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ISO standard ISO 12232:2006 gives digital still camera manufacturers a choice of five different techniques for determining the exposure index rating at each sensitivity setting provided by a particular camera model. Three of the techniques in ISO 12232:2006 are carried over from the 1998 version of the standard, while two new techniques allowing for measurement of JPEG output files are introduced from CIPA DC-004. Depending on the technique selected, the exposure index rating can depend on the sensor sensitivity, the sensor noise, and the appearance of the resulting image. The standard specifies the measurement of light sensitivity of the entire digital camera system and not of individual components such as digital sensors, although Kodak has reported using a variation to characterize the sensitivity of two of their sensors in 2001. What techniques did CIPA DC-004 provide?","completion":"CIPA DC-004 provided two new techniques to measure the exposure index rating (like how sensitive a digital camera is to light) for digital cameras. These techniques use the photo you take (in JPEG format) to calculate how sensitive the camera is. They introduced these methods to create a better way to measure light sensitivity for the whole camera, not just specific parts of it.

Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....","completion":"The last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries is Lochner.

Rebel factions such as the Revolutionary United Front frequently terrorize the countryside, intimidating Mende locals and enslaving many to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. One such unfortunate local is fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) from Shenge, who has been assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison (David Harewood), a ruthless warlord. One morning Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond in the riverbank and buries it in the soft earth. Captain Poison learns of the stone, but before he can follow up, the area is raided by government security forces. Both Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in Freetown, along with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Rhodesian gunrunner jailed while trying to smuggle diamonds into Liberia. These were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap (Marius Weyers), a corrupt South African mining executive. Having managed to learn about the pink diamond, Archer arranges to have Vandy freed from detention. He travels to Cape Town, meeting with his former military contacts, including Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), an Afrikaner formerly with the apartheid-era South African Defence Force. Coetzee now freelances with a private military firm. Archer says he wants to recover the diamond and use it to leave the continent forever, but Coetzee counters with his claim, saying his lost stake in Archer's botched Liberian operation entitles him to the diamond as compensation. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will recover the prized possession. Meanwhile, RUF insurgents escalate hostilities. Freetown falls to their advance while Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is among those rounded up to serve as a child soldier under a liberated Captain Poison.

The primary source of rain in the Sahara is the equatorial low a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and the southern Sahara. The Sahara doesn't lack precipitation because of a lack of moisture, but due to the lack of a precipitation-generating mechanism. Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of relative humidity, a significant diurnal temperature variation and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): When are high temperatures erratic?","completion":"High temperatures can be considered erratic when they occur outside of their expected patterns, diverging from average or normal temperatures, or when they fluctuate significantly over a short period. Several factors can contribute to erratic high temperatures, such as: 1. Climate Change: As a result of human activities, average global temperatures have been rising, leading to more frequent heatwaves and extreme temperature events. This can cause high temperatures to become more erratic, as they may become more intense or occur outside of typical patterns. 2. Localized Weather Phenomena: Occasionally, short-lived and localized weather events, such as heat domes or foehn winds, can result in temporary spikes in temperature. These events can cause high temperatures to be erratic in specific regions. 3. Topography and Geographic Features: The local landscape can influence the distribution of heat and temperature patterns. For instance, mountain ranges can cause variations in temperature depending on elevation, creating microclimates where high temperatures can be more erratic. 4. Seasonal Changes: During the transitional months between seasons, temperatures can sometimes fluctuate greatly from day to day. In the spring and fall, warm and cold air masses can compete for dominance, resulting in inconsistent high temperatures. 5. Urban Heat Islands: Cities and urban areas often experience higher temperatures due to the concentration of buildings, infrastructure, and other heat-absorbing surfaces. This effect can make high temperatures in cities more erratic compared to the surrounding rural areas. In general, erratic high temperatures can occur when external factors or localized conditions interfere with predictable temperature patterns. These instances can be temporary and isolated, or they can represent more significant, widespread changes resulting from climate change or other long-term influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Capitals will buy out Jeff Schultz Updated 2:08 p.m.: The Capitals placed Jeff Schultz on unconditional waivers Tuesday for the purpose of buying the defenseman out of the final year of his contract. Schultz, 27, will receive a compliance buyout, which means the 2 million Washington owes him over the next two years will not count against the salary cap. The blue-liner had one year remaining on his four-year, 11 million contract and would have carried a 2.75 million salary cap hit in the 2013-14 season. General Manager George McPhee, who previously stated his dislike of compliance buyouts, declined to comment Tuesday through a team spokesman. Under the new collective bargaining agreement, teams are permitted two compliance buyouts that can be used either this offseason or next. Assuming Schultz clears waivers and the Capitals are able to buy him out, the team will have one compliance buyout remaining that they can use either before this year’s window closes at 5 p.m. Thursday or next summer. Buying out Schultz will give Washington a little over 9 million in space under the 64.3 million salary cap. That additional room will provide important flexibility as the Capitals look to re-sign restricted free agents Karl Alzner, Marcus Johansson and perhaps bring in a new player once unrestricted free agency opens at noon on Friday. Washington’s move to buy out Schultz makes sense from both a salary-cap management and roster perspective. In late May, Schultz made it known that he requested a trade from the Capitals because of a lack of playing time over the past two seasons. Schultz, who played 399 regular season games for the Capitals through the first seven years of his NHL career, is glad to know he will have the chance at a fresh start. “It’s nice to have it happen now and I can look to the future,” Schultz said in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon. “I’m excited. I’m excited to move on and restart the game of hockey for me. The last month and a half of the year was tough just practicing all the time not knowing. I’m looking forward to starting over again. I want to get back out there and play.” The Calgary native’s role in Washington diminished rapidly over the past two years. A 2004 first-round pick, Schultz was a top-four defenseman for the Capitals as recently as the 2010-11 season but he quickly fell out of favor with Dale Hunter the following season. Under Adam Oates in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, he fell down the depth chart and became a consistent healthy scratch. He’s hoping to show once again he deserves a regular place in an NHL lineup. “It’s hard, you get out of the rhythm of things when you’re not either in the lineup or playing a regular shift,” Schultz said. “I think the biggest thing is just getting back out and playing and trying to get my game back to where it was. It starts with getting on a team, seeing where I fit in and going from there.” McPhee said last month that he was attempting to accommodate the defenseman’s trade request, but a trade wasn’t in the offing. It makes sense that the Capitals would buy out Schultz rather than use 2.75 million of their salary cap space with a player who had no defined role in the lineup. “We’ve told our players over the years, if you don’t want to play here we’ll move you,” McPhee said. “It’s that simple. This is a great place to play. Great place to live and work, great fan base. If you don’t want to play here, that’s fine we’ll move you along.” More from Post Sports Capitals extend qualifying offers to five RFAs Hendricks expected to test free agent market Caps interested in Lecavalier The Caps’ 2013 draft class What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Capitals, a hockey team, deciding to buy out a player named Jeff Schultz from the final year of his contract.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie opens in 48 B.C. shortly after the Battle of Pharsalus where Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) has defeated Pompey's army in a brutal civil war for control of the Roman Republic. Caesar learns that Pompey has fled to netrual Egypt, hoping to enlist the support of the young teenage Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Richard O'Sullivan) and his sister Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor).A few months later, Caesar arrives in Alexandria, the then-capital of Egypt. He meets the teenage Ptolemy whom is frequently surrounced by an entourage of ministers and advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking and decision-making for him. As a gesture of 'goodwill', the Egyptians present Caesar with Pompey's severed head, but Caesar is not pleased; it is a sorry end for a worthy foe.As Caesar settles in at the palace, Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), disguised as a rug peddler, brings a gift from Cleopatra. When a suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued with the young queen's beauty and warm personality as she persuades him to help her take back her thrown from her younger brother.Days later, Cleopatra warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Caesar is unconcerned. He orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, burning many buildings, including the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to deal with the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar begins kissing her.The Romans hold the main gate to the city after a fierce nightime battle. The next day, the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil and drive off the armies of Ptolemy. The following day, Caesar passes judgment in a show trial.

It goes by an even more mysterious title in the city’s 10 million contract with outside criminal defense lawyers: John Doe Investigation. But for New Yorkers, the matter is better known as the federal inquiry into Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and his aides, one that is said to focus on whether they traded favorable government actions for political contributions. Last week, the de Blasio administration quietly filed with the city’s comptroller its contract with a law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, that has for months been acting as outside counsel for the mayor and his aides. The contract, obtained by The New York Times through a request under the state Freedom of Information Law, offers the most detailed look yet at the cost of defending actions that the mayor has insisted were appropriate and legal. The Law Department, which arranged for the legal services through negotiation as opposed to a competitive bid process, described in concise terms its need for a firm “with expertise in criminal defense law to provide legal services in support of the John Doe Investigation and any related litigation.” The department checked several boxes saying it required a contractor to “obtain special expertise” not available at the agency, “provide services not needed on a long-term basis,” “accomplish work within a limited amount of time” and “avoid a conflict of interest.” The city’s corporation counsel, who oversees the department, waived a requirement for a public hearing on the contract, the documents show, on the ground that a hearing could “disclose litigation strategy.” The de Blasio administration, prompted by required budgetary reports, has in recent days offered a limited accounting of its spending on outside lawyers: 6.5 million through the end of the year for overlapping investigations of the mayor, said Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio’s spokesman. That amount includes 400,000 for lawyers at Carter Ledyard & Milburn, who have helped defend the city in state and local inquiries — including one by the comptroller — into the sale in February of Rivington House, a former nursing home in Manhattan whose deed restricted use of the property to nonprofit residential health care. Mr. Phillips declined to comment on whether the firm continued to work for the city on that matter. Mr. de Blasio, asked at a news conference on Friday about the costs, said: “We’ve been asked to provide information; we’ve been very, very cooperative, and as many times as the investigators want to talk to members of the administration, of course they will have that opportunity. But each time requires preparation and representation. That’s why.” A Law Department spokesman declined to reply to a list of questions about the contract. Dan Levitan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio’s 2013 and 2017 campaigns, said the mayor and his aides acted “ethically and appropriately at all times.” Mr. Levitan said no public money had been spent to defend the 2013 campaign or the mayor’s political nonprofit, Campaign for One New York, which is at the center of some of the investigations. He declined to say how much non-city money had been spent to defend them. “We hope that the investigations, which have now lasted over seven months, will draw to a close,” Mr. Levitan said in an email. The contract with Debevoise & Plimpton — described as a “multiyear agreement” — is retroactive to April 25, several weeks after news reports surfaced that an investigation by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan into corruption at the Police Department had spread to include fund-raising by Mr. de Blasio. It is set to last “through final disposition,” one document says. Elsewhere, the end date is given as July 31, 2020. The costs are set out in the contract and are commensurate with rates charged by other top city firms: 850 an hour for work by partners, 650 an hour for counsel, 575 an hour for associates and 175 for paralegals and other staff. A spokesman for the comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, whose office approves most city contracts, declined to comment on whether the spending was appropriate or on other aspects of the contract, which is currently under review by his office. Of the total cost of 10 million, 2 million is for the 2016 fiscal year, with the rest to be spent in the 2017 fiscal year, the documents show. A Nov. 14 memo from the Law Department included with the contract said that because of “severe time constraints,” the firm had commenced work before the contract was officially registered, but that it had “not yet been paid.” Matthew E. Fishbein, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton who signed the contract for the firm, declined to comment. But his page on his company website says that his experience “defending companies and executives” includes “ongoing inquiries by federal and local authorities into Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign fund-raising practices and related issues.” In the more than 80 pages of documents in the filing, the mayor’s name is not mentioned in connection with the matter. And only once is the nature of the John Doe Investigation hinted at: in a letter from the Law Department to Mr. Fishbein, which describes the inquiry as being “conducted by the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Investigation and other entities.” The letter says the firm would represent city employees — and “the employees of other entities the city has agreed to represent and/or defend” — in interviews or if subpoenaed to give grand jury testimony. Asked on Friday if he had been interviewed by federal authorities, Mr. de Blasio had a simple response: “No.” A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2016, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: 10 Million Contract Details Cost of Defending de Blasio.

Answer the following question: David is trying to understand temperature and the science behind it. He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","completion":"Particles would move faster in object A than in object B. This is because temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since object A has a higher temperature, its particles have more kinetic energy and move more quickly, while the particles in object B with a lower temperature have less kinetic energy and move more slowly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Researchers have found more evidence that suggests a relationship between races and rates of lung cancer among smokers. A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year research studied more than 180,000 people. They included present and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study are reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites are the heaviest smokers. But the scientists point out that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Scientists know that some diseases effect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients. The name is BiDil. The agency called it \\"a step toward the promise of personalized medicine.\\" Question: Which of the following orders is from higher to lower risk of having lung cancer? Answer: A:","completion":"Black people, Native Hawaiians, Whites, Japanese-Americans, Latinos B: Whites, Black people, Japanese-Americans, Native Hawaiians, Latinos C: Latinos, Japanese-Americans, Whites, Native Hawaiians, Black people D: Black people, Native Hawaiians, Japanese-Americans, Latinos, Whites Based on the information provided in the article, the correct answer is A: Black people, Native Hawaiians, Whites, Japanese-Americans, Latinos. The article states that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking than the other groups mentioned. It then contrasts their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos, indirectly suggesting that the risk for these groups is less. Although the article does not provide explicit numerical or percentile data indicating the precise risk level among these groups, the implied order of risk can be inferred from the context. Whites are mentioned as being the heaviest smokers but are not mentioned to be at the highest risk, possibly because Black individuals and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer, possibly due to genetic and other factors like breathing smoke more deeply. After these groups, Japanese-Americans and Latinos are mentioned. While the specific risk for these groups isn't delineated, the order of mention follows the sequence of risk implied. It’s also important to note that even among these groups, there are variations in risk. For example, the article mentions that African-Americans and Latinos tend to smoke fewer cigarettes per day. In conclusion, the risk of lung cancer can vary based on racial and ethnic differences, likely due to a combination of different factors including genetics, behaviours, and environmental influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If rejection happens, have a healthy outlook. A person may decline your invitation for many reasons. A person may be too busy to hang out or have prior commitments. If someone does reject you, it is not because something is wrong with you. Maybe the two of you were not a good fit. Be proud of yourself for trying to make friends and try to learn something from the experience. Keep trying to befriend the same acquaintance. Try to make plans with someone a couple of times before giving up.. The only time you should give up sooner is if you're given a clear indication that your goodwill isn't wanted. Keep trying to make friends with other people. Even if one person rejects your friendship completely, that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. After you've given up on one person, continue trying to make friends out of your other acquaintances. Making new friends is exciting and scary at the same time.

It is okay to be nervous, just push through your feelings and go.. There will be times when you look silly, are embarrassed, or feel awkward. Some interactions will go really well and others will not. All of that is perfectly fine, and it is not a big deal. Social media is great in a lot of ways, but oftentimes, it acts as a crutch that prevents people from pushing themselves into real life social situations. When you feel lonely, turn off your computer and head out, call up a friend, or try to meet with an acquaintance. You must get out of the house to meet people and form friendships. Social media websites offer the greatest benefit when they keep you more connected to your friends. If your social media accounts only give you an excuse to avoid real, meaningful contact with people, they're doing more harm than good. Forming friendships is a process. Both you and the other person must put in time and effort. It usually takes 6 to 8 significant interactions for people to come friends, and it may take years before you feel as if you can really confide in another person. Most adults have a fairly small social circle. Even when you've had some success, you may only be close with two or three different friends. You may have different friends to meet different needs in your life. Some friends are for regular happy hour or lunches, while you may go hiking with another friend. Working on a couple of close friendships or gathering a huge circle of casual friends are both options. Do whatever makes you happy. Keep in touch with your old friends and continually work on your relationship with any new friends you make. If you have hung out with someone and had a good time, invite them out again and keep in touch. Some friendships will take more time to grow than others. Some of your new friendships may start out great and then burn out. This is completely normal. Try to schedule regular times to meet with your friends. If both of you are able to meet each Friday for an hour, go for it. For friends who are a bit busier, set aside at least one regular time to meet each month, like each second Sunday afternoon or every third Thursday evening.","completion":"When you try to make friends, sometimes people might say no. That's okay! Maybe they are busy or just not a good match for you. Keep trying to make friends with other people, because not everyone will say no. To make friends, go out and do fun things with others, like playing or doing activities. Sometimes you might feel silly or nervous, but it's normal. Don't just use the computer to talk to people; go meet them in person too. Making friends takes time and effort, and you might have just a few close friends or many friends for different things. Remember to keep talking to your old friends and your new friends, and try to see them regularly. Sometimes friends come and go, but that's normal too. Just keep trying to make new friends and have fun!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Please answer the following question: Alex went to a pizza pace with Cameron after they won an award. Given the context: How would you describe Alex? Possible answers: boring, healthy, giving Answer:","completion":"Alex could be described as giving in this particular context. After winning an award, Alex chose to celebrate the achievement by going to a pizza place with Cameron, which can be seen as a generous and friendly act. This decision demonstrates Alex's willingness to share their happiness and success with someone else, rather than keeping it all to themselves. It is worth noting that we do not have much information to fully describe the character of Alex, but within the given context, the description of \\"giving\\" fits best among the other choices mentioned. Boring would not be the appropriate descriptor in this context, as Alex's decision to go to a pizza place can be seen as a way to enjoy and celebrate the accomplishment. It is an act of spending quality time with someone, which is considered a fun and social activity. Choosing to share their achievement with another person indicates they are open to communication, interaction, and engagement. As for the option of Alex being healthy, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based solely on the context provided. While it is true that pizza may not be considered the healthiest choice, people from all walks of life, including those who regularly prioritize healthy habits, occasionally indulge in less healthy food options, especially during celebratory occasions. Thus, we would need more information about Alex's daily habits and personal preferences to give an accurate description of their overall healthiness. In conclusion, the most suitable description for Alex within the given context would be giving, as they showed a willingness to share their success and spend time with another person, celebrating their achievement in a fun and social manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said it would be \\"a real challenge to keep people safe\\" if front-line officers are reduced. The Met believes it will face cuts of up to Â£1bn when a spending review looking at funding levels beyond 2015/16 is announced on 25 November. The Home Office said forces would still have the resources to do their work. London mayor Boris Johnson said policing in the capital would not see cuts \\"anything like the order\\" of those suggested by Britain's most senior officer. He said while Mr Hogan-Howe's comments were \\"sensible\\", he did not think the cuts will be so severe. Mike Penning, minister for policing, crime, criminal justice and victims, said no final decisions had been made. However, he said how officers were deployed was what was important, \\"not how many of them there are in total.\\" But, Sir Bernard said as London was expected to grow by one million people over the next 10 to 15 years, cuts would make the police's job much more difficult. \\"We are going to see less visibility, we will see less patrolling, and we'll be slower to respond because there will be fewer of us\\", he said. Mr Johnson said he had kept police numbers high during his eight-year tenure despite cuts across the country. \\"It is up to us to make the case for London and that's what we are going to do in the course of the next few weeks. \\"But the case has always been very strong, which is that London's population is growing,\\" he added. Stephen Greenhalgh, deputy mayor for policing and crime in London, said he was \\"extremely concerned\\" by the potential cuts that he said he would fight \\"tooth and nail\\". He blamed the formula used to calculate how policing budgets are allocated across the country, describing it as \\"ill-conceived and poorly thought through\\". However, some groups believe savings could be made by reducing frontline officers because new types of crime had meant policing had changed. Andrew Haldenby, director of the think tank Reform, said forces required a better mix of employees with fewer \\"traditional police officers\\". \\"We need more different kinds of police employees, for example doing cyber crime and domestic violence,\\" he said.

He was adopted at three weeks old and raised Jewish. His biological parents had been Irish American. Breitbart has been lauded for his role in the \\"evolution of pioneering websites\\" including The Huffington Post and The Drudge Report, and more recently his \\"Big\\" sites. Journalists such as Nick Gillespie and Conor Friedersdorf have credited Breitbart with bringing new voices to debates about politics and culture. Breitbart told Reason in 2004 that after feeling ignored by existing outlets, \\"We decided to go out and create our media.\\" Described as \\"a series of do-it-yourself demonstration projects\\" and \\"conversation pits\\", the Breitbart.com websites have been both criticized and praised for their role in various political issues. Breitbart has been recognized for adopting an inclusive stance with regard to LGBT participation in the conservative movement. He has also been credited with helping to derail conspiracy theories about Barack Obama's citizenship. In 1995, Breitbart saw The Drudge Report and was so impressed that he e-mailed Matt Drudge. Breitbart said, \\"I thought what he was doing was by far the coolest thing on the Internet. And I still do.\\" Breitbart described himself as \\"Matt Drudge's bitch\\" and selected and posted links to other news wire sources. Later, Drudge introduced him to Arianna Huffington (when she was still a Republican) and Breitbart subsequently assisted in the creation of The Huffington Post. Breitbart wrote a weekly column for The Washington Times, which also appeared at Real Clear Politics. Breitbart also co-wrote the book Hollywood, Interrupted: Insanity Chic in Babylon with Mark Ebner, a book that is highly critical of U.S. celebrity culture.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R.

Question: \\"Who went to the countryside?\\" Context: \\"The Prussian Army, under the terms of the armistice, held a brief victory parade in Paris on 17 February; the city was silent and draped with black and the Germans quickly withdrew. Bismarck honoured the armistice, by allowing train loads of food into Paris and withdrawing Prussian forces to the east of the city, prior to a full withdrawal once France agreed to pay a five billion franc war indemnity. At the same time, Prussian forces were concentrated in the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. An exodus occurred from Paris as some 200,000 people, predominantly middle-class, went to the countryside.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In the given context, the individuals who went to the countryside were primarily the middle-class citizens of Paris, amounting to around 200,000 people. This exodus took place amidst a series of events that followed the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-1871, which led to a temporary occupation of the French capital, Paris, by the Prussian Army. After achieving victory against France and signing an armistice, the Prussian Army held a short victory parade in Paris on February 17. The atmosphere in the city was somber as it was draped in black, signifying the mourning of the French people over their defeat. However, the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who was also a key figure in the war, adhered to the terms of the agreement by permitting food supplies to enter Paris and soon ordered the withdrawal of Prussian forces to the east of the city. Simultaneously, the Prussian troops were stationed in the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, which further intensified the unsettling environment in the country. The French government, burdened by the five billion franc war indemnity, further fueled the sense of uncertainty among the Parisian population. Consequently, this chain of events triggered a mass migration of middle-class Parisians, estimated at around 200,000, to seek refuge and security in the countryside. These people likely considered the countryside as a safer and more stable environment, away from the direct impact of the war and political turmoil that affected the urban center of Paris."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As they entered the pet store, Erin and Kayla diligently began their search, examining a variety of collars in different materials – from sturdy leather to lightweight nylon, and stylish metal chains to eco-friendly hemp – all while keeping in mind the safety and comfort of their beloved pets. Additionally, they considered various features such as reflective strips for better visibility during nighttime walks, padded lining for extra comfort, and easy-to-use buckles for convenience. Erin, who was always more practical-minded, focused on choosing a collar that offered durability and strength to withstand her dog's more boisterous tendencies when playing in the park or going on long walks in their neighborhood. Meanwhile, Kayla was more attuned to the aesthetic aspects, looking for eye-catching designs, vibrant colors, and unique patterns that would make her dog stand out from the crowd and reflect its playful and energetic spirit. As they browsed the extensive selection of collars available, the two friends frequently consulted with each other, sharing their opinions and offering suggestions on potential options that might interest the other. They also sought guidance from experienced store staff, who provided valuable insights on proper sizing, adjustability, and popular brands known for producing high-quality, reliable collars. Erin and Kayla were careful to consider their pooches' breed-specific needs and listened attentively as the staff members shared anecdotes about the collars they had found to be suitable for various neck types and sizes. After thoroughly evaluating their options, the two friends finally settled on the perfect collars for their furry companions. For Erin's dog, they chose a wide, durable leather collar with a solid metal buckle, designed to accommodate its large neck while providing ample support without compromising on comfort. The collar even had a built-in identification tag holder for added convenience, making it a perfect blend of form and function. On the other hand, for Kayla's dog, they found a lightweight, colorful nylon collar adorned with a playful pattern of bones and paw prints, which was ideal for its smaller neck and matched its enthusiastic, fun-loving nature. Their shopping adventure complete, Erin and Kayla were eager to present their new collars to their excited canines, confident that they had made the best choices for their beloved pets. As they walked out of the store, the two friends were filled with satisfaction, knowing that their diligent research and thoughtful decision-making process had resulted in stylish, comfortable, and high-quality collars that would suit their dogs perfectly, catering to both their unique physical features and their individual personalities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: How you end a computer session depends on how you use the computer, your views on energy conservation , and what you have been told about how your decision will affect your investment's longevity: will frequent starting and stopping cause its circuits to burn out sooner? Rest easy, your computer is more likely to be damaged by a virus picked up from the Internet than by being turned off and on too much. They are also energyefficient: such efficiency has reached the point where most computers place themselves in sleep mode if they remain idle for a certain period of time. So your computer will likely slip into sleep mode anyway, even if you leave it on overnight. Sleep mode itself, once a pretty unreliable option--you never knew if you would be able to wake your computer without having to reboot it--has been vastly improved with newer operating systems. If you want your computer to consume as little energy as possible when not in use, shut it down. If you want it to consume zero energy, you're going to have to unplug (......) it. Your computer can be in only three states: on, sleep or off--each of which draws some level of electric current. A computer that is \\"on\\" will either be actively processing information or sitting idle, depending on whether the user is typing a document, reading an email or has stepped away briefly. The amount of wattage drawn when the computer is on varies greatly depending on whether it is a laptop or a desktop computer. The latter uses more energy because desktop power supplies are less efficient and require a separate and often larger, powerhungry monitor. It also varies based on the type of work being done: complex calculations requiring intensive processing are more powerhungry, whereas writing or Web browsing consumes far less electricity. Question: If sleep mode goes wrong, what will probably happen to your computer? Answer: A:","completion":"It will be damaged by a virus. B: You will have to reboot it. C: It will consume more energy. D: The computer will become obsolete. Based on the information in the article, the correct answer is B: You will have to reboot it.

As exhausting as Jiro may be, he's also inspiring. 2. The most interesting moments, however, belong not to the chef but to those who labor in his shadow. 3. Jiro Ono makes sushi Dreams come true 4. As a tribute to the art of preparing traditional Japanese cuisine it could hardly be bettered. But it's arguably even more fascinating as a portrait of one man's single-minded devotion to his craft and its effect on the next generation. 5. Any documentary that can make sushi interesting for 90 minutes clearly does something right. 6. Savory documentary, which is especially appetizing for foodies. 7. This documentary strikes a balance between storytelling and food porn that's hard to come by in foodie flicks. Like a proper sushi meal, \\"Jiro\\" left me feeling sated, not stuffed. 8. You don't have to like sushi to appreciate a master 9. As simple and elegant as Jiro's preparations, \\"Sushi\\" alternates between the master musing on his cooking philosophy (good food, he says, makes him feel \\"victorious\\") and footage of the three chefs at work in their minuscule kitchen. 10.

What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"Looking at all the reviews, the overall consensus of the movie is that it is highly regarded. The recurring themes in the feedback involve admiration for the subject, Jiro Ono, especially the dedication and mastery he displays towards sushi-making. Step 1: I started by going through each review individually. Step 2: Some of the recurring positive sentiments I found include words such as \\"inspiring,\\" \\"interesting,\\" \\"fascinating,\\" \\"sated,\\" \\"simple, and elegant,\\" and \\"compelling\\". Step 3: Then, I took note of any negative or critical statements, but in this case, there was no discernible negative sentiment towards the movie. Step 4: I analyzed the context of these statements. They all seemed to praise either the subject (Jiro Ono), the storytelling, the footage or the portrayal of food or sushi-making. Step 5: From this analysis, I deduced that the audience generally appreciated the film due to the mastery displayed by its main character, its potent storytelling, and the detailed portrayal of the art of sushi-making. The viewers seemed to find it compelling and interesting, regardless of whether they were particularly interested in sushi or not. It appears to have been particularly appreciated by foodies, but also found favor among general viewers. The documentary has been perceived capable of maintaining the interest of the audience and making a seemingly niche topic (sushi-making) interesting for the entire duration. Therefore, the overall consensus about the movie seems to be extremely positive, indicating that the movie was successful in achieving what it aimed for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's the sentence in question: \\"We talked about that he was sick for days.\\" Step 1: Identify issues in grammar and syntax: - The sentence appears to include a relative clause 'that he was sick for days'. However, 'that' is used inappropriately. - A more appropriate connector should be used to link the main clause 'We talked about' and the subordinate clause 'he was sick for days.' Step 2: Correct the identified issues: - Replace 'that' with a more appropriate connector like 'how'. Revised sentence: \\"We talked about how he was sick for days.\\" Step 3: Check clarity: - The revised sentence is now clearer and effectively conveys the intended meaning. In conclusion, the original sentence needed improvement in terms of grammar, syntax, and clarity.

Question: - The sperm implants itself into the egg - The sperm and egg form a zygote on the wall of the uterus - The fetus grows and develops - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby is raised by parents until it is able to take care of itself - The person goes out into the world and finds a job - The person meets other people and has a life - The person gets a career, and gets married - The person retires and eventually passes away - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process in the human life cycle you've described is the sperm implanting itself into the egg. This crucial event takes place during fertilization, which is the initial stage of the human reproductive process. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell from a male successfully penetrates an egg cell from a female, resulting in the fusion of their genetic material. This process begins with ovulation, which is when a woman's ovary releases a mature egg (ovum) into the fallopian tube. In most cases, ovulation occurs around the midpoint of a woman's menstrual cycle and is the time when she is most likely to conceive. Meanwhile, the male ejaculates sperm during sexual intercourse, and the sperm travels through the cervix and into the uterus, ultimately reaching the fallopian tube where the egg is located. Out of millions of sperm cells, only a small number manage to reach the egg, although only one sperm cell can fertilize the egg successfully. Once the sperm has penetrated the egg's outer layer, the sperm head fuses with the egg, allowing their genetic material to combine. The egg then undergoes a few changes to prevent any other sperm from entering and fertilizing it. The resulting single-celled entity, now called a zygote, contains a unique combination of genetic material from both parents, shaping the individual's inherited traits and characteristics. This fertilization process marks the beginning of human life and sets the stage for all future development and growth. Following this initial step, the zygote travels down the fallopian tube and implants itself in the wall of the uterus, where it will grow and develop into a fetus over the course of roughly nine months. Throughout this period, the fetus will rely on its mother for nourishment and protection, eventually resulting in a baby that is born and raised by its parents to become a fully-fledged individual who experiences life, builds relationships, pursues a career, and eventually passes away. In summary, the first step of the process in the human life cycle is the moment when a sperm cell successfully implants itself into an egg, leading to the formation of a zygote and heralding the beginning of an individual's unique life journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? or worth rooting against , for that matter","completion":"The phrase \\"or worth rooting against, for that matter\\" can be considered as having a more negative connotation. To break down this phrase and better understand its meaning and tone, let us look at the different components. 1. \\"Worth rooting against\\": This phrase suggests that someone is actively cheering for the failure or downfall of a particular person, team, or idea. The act of \\"rooting against\\" something inherently carries a negative sentiment, because it involves wanting or expecting someone or something to not succeed or to experience a negative outcome. 2. \\"For that matter\\": This phrase is used to emphasize that the sentiment being discussed is relevant and applicable to not only the situation at hand but also other similar situations or subjects. By saying \\"for that matter,\\" the speaker is broadening the scope of the conversation and implying that the negativity towards a situation is not limited to just one area. Taking these components into account, the complete phrase \\"or worth rooting against, for that matter\\" reflects a negative sentiment. Depending on the context in which this phrase is used, it can indicate that the speaker is emphasizing their disapproval or opposition towards something – whether it's a person, team, or idea – and they expect or desire a negative outcome for it. It's essential to keep in mind that, while the phrase generally leans towards negativity, the specific context in which it is used can determine the exact tone and meaning it carries in a particular conversation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This will happen, he said, \\"when true self-driving is approved by regulators,\\" a turn of events that's at least several years away. ||||| The first master plan that I wrote 10 years ago is now in the final stages of completion. It wasn't all that complicated and basically consisted of: Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car And... Provide solar power. No kidding, this has literally been on our website for 10 years. The reason we had to start off with step 1 was that it was all I could afford to do with what I made from PayPal. I thought our chances of success were so low that I didn't want to risk anyone's funds in the beginning but my own. The list of successful car company startups is short. As of 2016, the number of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt is a grand total of two: Ford and Tesla. Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car company is idiocy squared. Also, a low volume car means a much smaller, simpler factory, albeit with most things done by hand. Without economies of scale, anything we built would be expensive, whether it was an economy sedan or a sports car. While at least some people would be prepared to pay a high price for a sports car, no one was going to pay 100k for an electric Honda Civic, no matter how cool it looked. Part of the reason I wrote the first master plan was to defend against the inevitable attacks Tesla would face accusing us of just caring about making cars for rich people, implying that we felt there was a shortage of sports car companies or some other bizarre rationale. Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless attack articles on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much completely failed that objective. However, the main reason was to explain how our actions fit into a larger picture, so that they would seem less random. The point of all this was, and remains, accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we can imagine far into the future and life is still good. That's what \\"sustainable\\" means. It's not some silly, hippy thing -- it matters for everyone. By definition, we must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse. Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic carbon levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better. Here is what we plan to do to make that day come sooner: Integrate Energy Generation and Storage Create a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world. One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app. We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies. That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to bring them together. Expand to Cover the Major Forms of Terrestrial Transport Today, Tesla addresses two relatively small segments of premium sedans and SUVs. With the Model 3, a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck, we plan to address most of the consumer market. A lower cost vehicle than the Model 3 is unlikely to be necessary, because of the third part of the plan described below. What really matters to accelerate a sustainable future is being able to scale up production volume as quickly as possible. That is why Tesla engineering has transitioned to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the machine -- turning the factory itself into a product. A first principles physics analysis of automotive production suggests that somewhere between a 5 to 10 fold improvement is achievable by version 3 on a roughly 2 year iteration cycle. The first Model 3 factory machine should be thought of as version 0.5, with version 1.0 probably in 2018. In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. Both are in the early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready for unveiling next year. We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate. With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense to shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus driver to that of fleet manager. Traffic congestion would improve due to increased passenger areal density by eliminating the center aisle and putting seats where there are currently entryways, and matching acceleration and braking to other vehicles, thus avoiding the inertial impedance to smooth traffic flow of traditional heavy buses. It would also take people all the way to their destination. Fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops would serve those who don't have a phone. Design accommodates wheelchairs, strollers and bikes. Autonomy As the technology matures, all Tesla vehicles will have the hardware necessary to be fully self-driving with fail-operational capability, meaning that any given system in the car could break and your car will still drive itself safely. It is important to emphasize that refinement and validation of the software will take much longer than putting in place the cameras, radar, sonar and computing hardware. Even once the software is highly refined and far better than the average human driver, there will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km). Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million miles (5 million km) per day. I should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point in the future. The most important reason is that, when used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability. According to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report, automotive fatalities increased by 8% to one death every 89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and the system gets better every day. It would no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named. It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as \\"beta\\". This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average, the beta label will be removed. Sharing When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination. You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not. In cities where demand exceeds the supply of customer-owned cars, Tesla will operate its own fleet, ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are. So, in short, Master Plan, Part Deux is: Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Elon Musk had teased the publication of the plan on Twitter for several days Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, has published the second part of his self-titled \\"masterplan\\". He said Tesla would be branching out into creating a \\"solar-roof-with-battery product\\" that people can have fitted to their homes. He wants the Tesla electric car range to cover all types of ground vehicles, specifically buses and lorries. And once the cars have full autonomous driving capability, Mr Musk said Tesla would allow owners to add their cars to a shared fleet, meaning the vehicles can be making money for their owners when they are not using them. Mr Musk had teased the publication of the plan on Twitter for several days, recently saying he'd pulled an all-nighter in order to finish it. His ambition, he wrote, was to \\"accelerate the advent of sustainable energy\\". \\"We must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse. \\"Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic carbon levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.\\" Mr Musk's plans have, though, drawn criticism from analysts, who suggest they are too vague. \\"As is typical, Elon Musk has laid out a grandiose plan for the future with no timeframes and few specifics, and no mention of how and when Tesla will be profitable,\\" Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Autotrader, said. She added that while Tesla's latest plan included expanding its electric vehicle product line to cover all major segments, \\"it hasn't been meeting production targets with the limited product line it has now and in the next couple of years\\". Autopilot controversy Image copyright AFP/Getty Images The masterplan comes comes at a time when Mr Musk is facing criticism for the roll-out of Tesla's Autopilot feature, in which cars autonomously travel along motorways, changing lanes and speeding up or down in keeping with traffic. US road safety regulators are investigating whether Autopilot was at fault in a crash which left one man, the driver, dead. The software appears to have failed to spot a white lorry driving across the Tesla's path. Mr Musk stressed in his masterplan that Autopilot was in beta mode, and that all drivers are warned of that. He wrote: \\"It would no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named. \\"It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as 'beta'.

Mr Musk was also under pressure to explain the reasoning behind Tesla's purchase of SolarCity, a solar-power company that many considered to have been struggling. Mr Musk was its chief executive, and some investors said Tesla's purchase was essentially bailing out the ailing SolarCity. However, Mr Musk rationalised his thinking by saying his vision of sustainable energy in our homes required the two companies to be joined. \\"We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.\\" Mr Musk also seemed to suggest his company would one day compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft for personal transportation. Once the cars had achieved full, safe autonomy, he said, a service would be set up that allowed owners to make their cars part of a fleet others could summon via an app. In cities where there were too few Tesla owners to satisfy demand, Mr Musk said Tesla would \\"operate its own fleet, ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are\\".

Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook ||||| Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, who is facing intense scrutiny over a fatal crash involving one of his self-driving cars, has released an ambitious new “master plan” and has doubled down on his defense of the safety of the autopilot feature. Musk’s master plan “part deux”, published on Wednesday, outlines how he intends to reinvent mass transit systems, integrate “stunning solar roofs” into his cars and build self-driving buses and trucks. Tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode Read more The report comes 10 years after the tech billionaire published the first Tesla Motors Master Plan, which unveiled the cars that became the Tesla 3 sports sedan and Model S four-door family car. The release of a second part of a master plan comes amid a federal investigation into a May crash that killed a 40-year-old man. It appears that the driver, Joshua Brown, was using autopilot, a new self-driving mode that is still in a testing phase. Tesla claimed the technology could not distinguish between a white truck and a bright sky. After two subsequent crashes involving the autopilot system, Tesla, which has faced questions from the US Senate, said it had no plans to disable the feature. In his new plan, Musk said he would build a “smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world”. That means: “One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app,” he wrote. He said he also plans to merge his electric car company with his energy firm SolarCity. Musk said the Model 3 for consumers will eventually include a compact SUV option and a new kind of pickup truck. The CEO further intends to expand the technology beyond consumer vehicles to heavy-duty trucks and “high passenger-density urban transport”, according to the master plan. Those are both in early stages of development and should be ready for unveiling next year, Musk wrote. “We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate,” he added. His technology will also allow for buses to become smaller and for bus drivers to become “fleet managers”, Musk said, adding that this system would improve traffic congestion and would allow buses to take people directly to their destinations. Eventually, all Tesla vehicles will be “fully self-driving”, which means that even if a system in the car breaks down, the car would still be able to drive itself, according to the plan. Musk has faced growing criticisms for introducing a “beta” version of autopilot to the road and for seemingly overstating the capabilities of his technology, despite its current limitations. He appeared to address those concerns in the master plan, saying that Tesla decided to deploy partial autonomy now, rather than waiting, because “when used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability”. Since the crash, Musk has repeatedly pointed out that Brown’s death was “the first known fatality in just over 130 million miles” of the autopilot feature, and he has also slammed press coverage, noting that 1.3m people die in car accidents each year. Musk’s defensive Twitter rants, which some have called insensitive in the wake of a tragic death, offered a “case study” in how not to handle crises, according to some experts. Addressing concerns about the safety of letting consumers use a “beta” version of autopilot, Musk further wrote: “This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve.” Musk has been teasing the release of the new master plan on Twitter in recent days, writing on Tuesday that he planned to “pull an all-nighter” to finish it. The document also advertised expanded “sharing” capabilities, meaning drivers at work or on vacation could add their cars to a “shared fleet” for others to use, which would generate income, “significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost”. He wrote, “When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.” ||||| (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk Wednesday unveiled an ambitious plan to expand the company into electric trucks and buses, car sharing and solar energy systems. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk smiles as he attends a forum on startups in Hong Kong, China January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip In a blog post titled “Master Plan, Part Deux,” Musk sketched a vision of an integrated carbon-free energy enterprise offering a wider range of vehicles, and products and services beyond electric cars and batteries. The newest elements of the strategy included plans to develop car and ride sharing programs as well as commercial vehicles - businesses where other companies already compete, and in some cases have ample head starts on Tesla. The new vehicles range from a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi to a public transport bus, a “new kind of pickup truck” and a compact SUV. The vehicles will be unveiled next year alongside Tesla’s existing fleet of electric cars.

Slideshow (2 Images) The plan did not detail how the new projects would be financed at a time when Both Tesla and SolarCity are burning through cash. Musk summarized the plan saying Tesla aimed to “create stunning solar roofs (for homes) with seamlessly integrated battery storage. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it.” Musk said he envisions Tesla owners allowing others to use their vehicles through a smartphone application. He indicated there will be a “Tesla shared fleet,” but did not offer details of how that fleet would be managed. Rival automakers are pursuing some of these goals as well. “In cities where demand exceeds the supply of customer-owned cars, Tesla will operate its own fleet, ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are,” he said. Such a service would put Tesla in competition with ride hailing services such as Uber UBER.UL or Lyft. Musk said all future Tesla products will have fully self-driving capability, including trucks and buses. He vigorously defended Tesla’s decision to offer what he described as a “beta” system to allow partial autonomy in its vehicles, a system called Autopilot. Federal regulators are investigating Autopilot after a fatal accident involving a Tesla Model S operating with the system engaged. “When used correctly, it (Autopilot) is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves,” he wrote. Musk did not say when fully autonomous Teslas would be ready, but indicated it could require roughly five years of additional testing. Most major automakers, as well as internet search company Alphabet Inc(GOOGL.O), are investing heavily in automated driving technology. Germany’s Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) is working on automated heavy trucks and electric commercial vehicles. General Motors Co (GM.N) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) are among the auto companies working on car sharing and forging alliances with ride hailing companies. On June 21, Musk proposed Tesla buy SolarCity. He outlined a combined company that could provide consumers with the tools for a largely carbon-free lifestyle - electric cars recharged with electricity generated by SolarCity solar panel systems, or stored in the home using battery packs produced by Tesla’s battery Gigafactory under construction near Reno, Nev. Musk owns 22 per cent of SolarCity’s shares, and has outlined plans to offer buyers of Tesla electric vehicles a solar power generation and battery storage system. To fund projects Tesla in May sold about 1.7 billion in new shares. Much of that will be used to accelerate development of its new Model 3 car lineup and reach a production pace of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018. On Monday, SolarCity said it raised 345 million to fund projects, and increased its debt facility by 110 million. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has unveiled the second part of his \\"master plan\\", which includes developing electric trucks and buses, car sharing and solar energy systems.

Combine the numbers on the left side of the equation: -19 + 27 = 8 Now the equation becomes: 8 = 4 * k Step 3: Solve for 'k' Now we need to isolate 'k' in the equation. In order to do that, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4: 8 / 4 = (4 * k) / 4 2 = k Step 4: Verify the solution We have found the value of 'k' which is 2. Let's verify our solution by plugging this value back into the original equation: -19 + 27 = 4 * 2 8 = 4 * 2 8 = 8 Our solution is correct because when we plug 'k' back into the equation, the equation holds true.

Summarize this article: Among the decades of trash spewed out by Ear Spring geyser were an old cinderblock, several damaged warning signs, a rubber heel insole and a baby pacifier from the 1930s. On Sept. 15, Yellowstone National Park's Ear Spring geyser erupted in its most violent display since 1957. For several minutes, sprays of steaming water leapt up to 30 feet (9 meters) in the air, chunks of rock and dirt spewed forth onto the ground and about 60 years of wishes were promptly reversed when the geyser gave up nearly 100 coins that had previously been tossed in. [Yellowstone and Yosemite: Photos of Two of the World's Oldest National Parks] Some coins were to be expected: Who among us hasn't flipped a good-luck penny into a thermal vent? But park officials were more surprised to find that decades of man-made garbage had also burst forth from Ear Spring — some of which dated back to the 1930s. The garbage geyser ejected nearly 100 metal coins during the Sept. 15 eruption. Some of them were rusted, scorched and crumbled to bits inside the geyser's steamy gut. Credit: Yellowstone National Park \\"After Ear Spring erupted on September 15, employees found a strange assortment of items strewn across the landscape around its vent,\\" officials wrote on the Yellowstone National Park Facebook page. \\"Some are clearly historic: they'll be inventoried by curators and may end up in Yellowstone's archives.\\" What have people been throwing into the geyser? Some of the historical detritus that Ear Spring coughed up includes a large chunk of cinderblock, a broken bottle, several metal warning signs, some old aluminum cans, plastic cups, cigarette butts, someone's rubber heel insert, a vintage pacifier from the 1930s and an 8-inch-long (20 centimeters) plastic drinking straw. (Editor's note: please do not try to drink a geyser.) Whether these foreign objects were dropped into the geyser accidentally or chucked in on purpose makes no difference. Either way, park officials wrote, it's bad for the geyser. \\"Foreign objects can damage hot springs and geysers,\\" park officials wrote on Facebook. \\"The next time Ear Spring erupts we hope it's nothing but natural rocks and water.\\" According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Ear Spring has erupted four times in the last 60 years, most recently in 2004. The geyser is located on Yellowstone's Geyser Hill, not far from the world-famous gusher Old Faithful. Several other geysers and thermal pools showed increased activity around the time of Ear Spring's eruption: For instance, a brand-new vent popped up and erupted overnight between Sept. 18 and 19. \\"An approximately 8-foot [2.4 m] diameter area of surrounding ground is 'breathing' – rising and falling by about six inches [15 cm] every 10 minutes,\\" USGS experts wrote in a news release. This increased hydrothermal activity could last anywhere from a few days to several years, the USGS wrote. It could also result in a \\"small hydrothermal explosion\\" that would carve out a shallow crater on Geyser Hill while spewing jets of boiling water and rocks hundreds of feet in the air. This is all to say, if you have been meaning to dispose of your old cinder block or vintage baby gear collection in a Yellowstone geyser, now is not the time.

(CBS News) - When Yellowstone's Ear Spring started erupting last month, it was a sight that hadn't been seen for decades. It's a natural wonder, but what it spewed out was anything but. After the hot spring, dormant since 1957, belched water up to 30 feet in the air, park officials found piles of man-made debris, including a cement block, cans, dozens of coins and a baby's pacifier, dating back to the 1930's. \\"The water had just washed out under the boardwalk and had strewn trash all around,\\" said Rebecca Roland, a Yellowstone National Park supervisory park ranger. The trash is being cataloged and could become part of Yellowstone's archives as a reminder to the millions of visitors to not use the park's natural wonders as a dumping ground. \\"You might think that if you toss something in a hot spring or in a geyser that it disappears, but it doesn't disappear. It stays in that and what normally happens is you can actually plug up a feature and kill the feature. And that's happened in many places in the park,\\" Roland said. It's been quite a few months of activity in Yellowstone National Park where Steamboat Geyser – the world's tallest – is approaching a record number of eruptions this year. ||||| ... social media.

Summarize: The Welsh Affairs Committee said it was satisfied with safety, but wanted clarity on costs. It said Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey should only be built if its electricity costs no more than that from Hinkley Point C in Somerset, or from renewable sources. The UK government said any proposed new sites would \\"need to offer value for money for the taxpayer\\". MPs carried out an inquiry into the potential of fresh power generation at the two nuclear sites in north Wales. A new £8bn station employing 1,000 people is planned for Wylfa to replace the plant which closed in December after operating for 44 years. A replacement has also been mooted for the Trawsfynydd plant, in Gwynedd, which stopped generating power in 1991 and is being decommissioned. The committee said it recognised a \\"notable lack of public confidence\\" in nuclear power following incidents such as the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, committee chairman David Davies said MPs were \\"impressed by the level of scrutiny\\" of the UK nuclear industry and \\"reassured that the highest safety standards are followed\\". \\"The key questions that need to be answered for future development of nuclear power at Wylfa and Trawsfynydd to be viable centre on value for money and local impact,\\" he added. \\"The [UK] government must prove that the cost of any nuclear development is well understood and competitive with renewable sources. These costs must be made public in a format that can be easily understood. \\"There has to be a demonstrable benefit for the local community as well. Local businesses must form a key part of the supply chain and be given sufficient information to allow this to happen. \\"We must also make use of the many skilled nuclear workers currently based in Wales and provide sufficient training to develop the next generation.\\" Doubts about the viability of Wylfa Newydd have surfaced amid negotiations about the \\"strike price\\" which ministers will pay for power generated by Hinkley Point C. Major renewable projects such as the £1bn Swansea Bay tidal lagoon also depend on a strike price, which subsidises the investment by guaranteeing revenue above the market rate for electricity. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \\"New nuclear power stations will provide secure, clean and affordable electricity for consumers across the country. \\"We are constantly working to get the best deal for consumers and any proposals for new sites, including Wylfa, will need to offer value for money for the taxpayer. \\"It's estimated that the local north Wales economy around the proposed Wylfa site will benefit from around £50m and hundreds of jobs.\\" Summary:","completion":"The Welsh Affairs Committee has called for clarity on costs and local impact before approving the construction of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power plant on Anglesey and the Trawsfynydd plant in Gwynedd.

Summarize: Many have applauded model Tamara Ecclestone for braving the backlash to post a photograph of herself breastfeeding her daughter, who is nearly three. The NHS says most women in the UK wish they could breastfeed for longer than they do, yet only one in 200 mothers do so past their baby's first birthday. Here, five mothers who carried on breastfeeding share their stories. Rebekah Ellis, 32, from Cambridge, breastfeeds both her six-month-old son and her daughter, who is three and a half. She says: \\"The reaction from the NHS has been supportive, albeit surprised. The midwives who attended my son's birth at home said 'Good for you,' when my husband explained. \\"Most people don't know that I am still feeding my daughter. I know that I would get a negative reaction from the vast majority. Even nursing past a year old is often seen as weird, disgusting - despite the WHO [World Health Organisation] recommendation [that children should be breastfed until the age of two or older]. \\"When I nurse my son out in public (my daughter hasn't wanted milk during the day since the age of 18 months), I use a cover. This is more for me than for the benefit of others. \\"People still look uncomfortable though, even when they can't see anything.\\" Kelly Lane, 38, from Redditch in Worcestershire, breastfed her daughter, now nine, and her son, now seven, until the age of two and a half. She says her confidence took a knock after a friend's husband criticised her, telling her it was \\"pointless\\" - but she carried on because she could see the health benefits for her children. She says: \\"You do have to be dedicated to do it but I was happy to give that up for what was only a very short period of my life. \\"The one quite hard thing is having a meal. I personally felt too uncomfortable to breastfeed in public and would use breast-feeding rooms or the toilet. \\"But breastfeeding in toilets is horrendous - they're not hygienic, there's not enough space and you're conscious you are taking up space for someone who might be queuing. \\"Both my children did not like having blankets thrown over them when feeding, as they like to look at Mummy and be talked to and, to be honest, rightly so. A child shouldn't be covered up when it's being nursed. \\"I feel so sad that society is so negative and disgusted that a mother would be feeding her child the way nature intended in public, than actually congratulating her for doing a great thing. \\"It's ok though for women to be up on billboards everywhere flashing every body part possible! The hypocrisy is astonishing!\\" Rebecca Alexander, 34, from Liverpool, still breastfeeds her son who will be three in April. She says she loves Tamara Ecclestone's \\"continued support and promotion of breastfeeding\\". She told the BBC: \\"I struggled feeding my elder daughter for more than three weeks first time around because of the lack of knowledge and support. Breastfeeding should be visible in our society. It's how we learn; by seeing others do it. \\"I set out on this journey [with my son] thinking I would breastfeed till two years and then pump until four. \\"When he has had big changes such as starting nursery, with a new childminder and me returning to work, breastfeeding has been his source of comfort and a way to reconnect after being apart all day. \\"How anyone can see it as sexual completely shocks me, and I think it says more about our society, and the view of women than anything else.\\" Sarah Johnson, who breastfeeds her two-year-old son twice a day, says: \\"I think it is a benefit for his health and also a nice bonding moment for us both, especially as I work away part of the week. \\"I have decided to continue until he is ready to stop, but I am coming under pressure from family members to stop - grandparents - who say he is 'no longer a baby'. \\"I tell them about the WHO guidelines for breastfeeding until two and beyond, but I guess in our Western culture you are seen as a hippy earth mother or odd if you still breastfeed a toddler - shame as in other parts of the world it is totally normal. \\"When did something natural become unnatural? I don't judge mothers who choose to bottle feed, so would not liked to be judged either. \\"Although the pictures [of Tamara Ecclestone] are rather posed, I commend her for posting them.\\" Sue Burgess, 57, from Oxford, breastfed her daughter until she was two and a half, and while she says she cannot understand why anyone would describe it as disgusting, she admits she only did it in public \\"a handful of times\\" as she found it \\"embarrassing\\". Although her daughter is now 16, Sue still cringes when she thinks about the \\"worst time\\" feeding her in a village square in Italy and feeling \\"exposed\\" as a solemn church procession took place close by. \\"My daughter started to say 'A boo! A boo! A BOO!!!' at ever-increasing volumes, which was her way of asking for a breastfeed. I complied unwillingly.\\" Sue adds: \\"Nonetheless, if other people feel the strength to take such experiences in their stride, I can only admire them.\\" Summary:","completion":"Model Tamara Ecclestone's photograph of herself breastfeeding her nearly three-year-old daughter has initiated a conversation about extended breastfeeding and normalizing it in society.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. Which city experienced fewer rocks breaking? Answer:","completion":"Tree city experienced fewer rocks breaking and fewer earthquakes. This is because it is located further away from the volcano (60 miles) compared to Red city (10 miles). The distance from the plate boundary and the volcanic activity can have a significant impact on the frequency and intensity of earthquakes experienced by each city. In this case, Tree city is less affected by the stresses and movements of the Earth's plates, resulting in fewer rocks breaking and a lower frequency of earthquakes compared to Red city."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Fear and Desire Context: Fear and Desire opens with an off-screen narration by actor David Allen who tells the audience: There is a war in this forest. Not a war that has been fought, nor one that will be, but any war. And the enemies who struggle here do not exist unless we call them into being. This forest then, and all that happens now is outside history. Only the unchanging shapes of fear and doubt and death are from our world. These soldiers that you see keep our language and our time, but have no other country but the mind.[4] The story is set during a war between two unidentified countries. An airplane carrying four soldiers from one country has crashed six miles behind enemy lines. The soldiers come upon a river and build a raft, hoping they can use the waterway to reach their battalion. As they are building their raft, they are approached by a young peasant girl who does not speak their language. The soldiers apprehend the girl and bind her to a tree with their belts. The youngest of them is left behind to guard the girl. He starts to talk to her, but as she doesn't understand him he talks always more as a delirium and when he unbelts her believing she will embrace him, she tries to escape and the young soldier shoots her dead. Mac, another soldier of the four persuades the commander to let him take the raft for a solo voyage in connection with a plan to kill an enemy general at a nearby base. The remaining two soldiers successfully infiltrate the base. They talk and eat with their own general and return to the river to await Mac. Sitting there they philosophize about war and how no man is made for it.[5] Answer:","completion":"When the girl is unbelted in the movie Fear and Desire, she tries to escape from the situation.

Question: How would you describe Tracy? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: negligent B: thoughtful C: mean Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided context, the best word to describe Tracy would be B: thoughtful. Tracy can be described as a thoughtful individual, as they took the time and effort to make Bailey a sandwich, knowing that Bailey would need strength for whatever task they were facing. This action shows that Tracy pays attention to others' needs and is considerate about their feelings and well-being. Being thoughtful signifies that a person is mindful of others, careful in their actions, and genuinely concerned about the effects of their actions on those around them. The other options, negligent and mean, do not accurately reflect Tracy's character based on the given context. Negligent implies that the person neglects their responsibilities or fails to show appropriate care, which is not demonstrated by Tracy in this situation. On the contrary, Tracy actively took care of Bailey's needs by providing them with a sandwich. Similarly, mean suggests a person who is unkind, unsympathetic, or malicious, which is not an attribute shown by Tracy. Instead, Tracy demonstrated kindness and care toward Bailey by ensuring they have enough strength through the provision of a sandwich.

Someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say. And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My the nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in New York, and it will look real, and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he's learned that lesson now. And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's starring in this movie. OH wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of. So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall. I am so glad I didn't pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, around when the first act is ending, you realize it'll only get worse, and that's when you either need to leave, or kill yourself. In conclusion, this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding. Choose your answer.

Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized...

Due to the ratio of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a television station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that there must be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).[citation needed] Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area.

Given the question: This article: The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built \\"hutments\\" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive. contains an answer for the question: What counties was the CEW in?, what is it ?

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which point would see less ice sheets, point A or point B? John was reading about a fascinating story of a scientist in a science fiction book. In that novel the scientist met with a mysterious wormhole while visiting Antarctica. First, the wormhole started the time travel in present day, which was designated as point A. Then it sent the scientist to 170 million years in the past, which was designated as point B. The scientist had the rare experience of visiting Antarctica in two different time periods, 170 million years apart. Hint: More than 170 million years ago, Antarctica was part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.

Lugo A:","completion":"Title: The Shadow of Vengeance The movie opens in the vibrant metropolis of New Castleton, a modern city driven by the success and ambition of its inhabitants. Doug Kershaw (portrayed by Chris Evans) is an elite corporate lawyer, representing some of the biggest names in the city's business world. He's well-known for his ruthless courtroom tactics and spotless winning record, making him a force to be reckoned with. Despite the questionable ethics behind many of the cases he handles, Kershaw remains steadfast in his belief that everyone is entitled to the best legal representation possible. Our protagonist, Luna Lugo (played by Charlize Theron), is an enigmatic and fiercely talented private investigator who works in the shadows, operating independently and unbound by the rules of conventional law enforcement. She is known for her ability to disappear and work behind the scenes, getting the job done where others often fail. Her life has become an endless chase for justice, fueled by her own painful past marred by an unsolved murder. The two characters, Lugo and Kershaw, live seemingly separate lives in New Castleton. However, as the city's murky web of secrets and scandals begins to unravel, the pair unexpectedly find themselves on a collision course. Fate throws them together in a dangerous game of cat and mouse when Kershaw becomes the target of an unknown assassin, one who shows incredible skill, cunning, and determination. The initial stages of the film showcase Kershaw's enemies as he navigates through New Castleton's dark underbelly, crossing paths with ruthless mob bosses, shady businessmen, and vindictive politicians. Each of these parties has a motive to see Kershaw removed from the picture permanently, as his legal prowess and connections have caused problems for them in the past. The heart of the movie lies in the tense dynamic between Kershaw and Lugo. Suspicious of Lugo's true intentions and feeling threatened by her capabilities, Kershaw hires her to track down the would-be assassin, hoping that she will discover the truth behind the plot to end his life. As they dig deeper, the pair are pulled into a whirlwind of twists and betrayal, uncovering a web of intrigue that spans from the highest echelons of city's power players to the dark corners of its criminal underworld. Desperate to find the answers they seek, Lugo and Kershaw face shocking revelations and brutal confrontations. Lugo's thirst for justice becomes an obsession that strains her relationships and personal life, while Kershaw begins to question the core values that have governed his career. The trust they've built begins to break as they uncover the true motivations, lies, and dangerous alliances that have placed them both in the crosshairs of the assassin. In the explosive climax of the film, Lugo and Kershaw lay a trap to catch the elusive assassin and unmask the mastermind behind the plot. As they close in, they come face-to-face with the harsh realities of their own pasts, finally understanding the roles they've played in the city's fate and the true nature of the war they've waged. In the end, Lugo and Kershaw join forces to vanquish their enemies and uncover the truth. They're left with a new understanding of one another, as well as the city they call home. The Shadow of Vengeance is a thrilling tale of suspense, action, and redemption, exploring themes of morality, justice, and the complex, often brutal nature of the choices we make in an ever-changing world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rebecca, in her mid-thirties, is a successful businesswoman who is known for her refined sense of style. A big part of her signature look over the years was her extensive collection of silk scarves. Each featuring unique designers from all across the globe, Rebecca had been gathering these scarves since her early twenties. They varied immensely in colors, patterns, and even textures, making each piece truly unique. They adorned her outfits, adding a touch of elegance and creativity to even her simplest attires. However, recently, Rebecca had read a book about minimalism, which sparked something inside her. She felt the need to simplify her life, starting with her wardrobe. Rebecca realized that she had been holding onto items that she hadn't used in a long time, one of them being her collection of silk scarves. Although beautiful, Rebecca hadn't used them as much she used to do. They were just sitting in her closet, taking up space, serving no actual purpose. This realization inspired her decision to declutter her closet. Her first step started with those untouched, underused silk scarves. Each held memories and had been part of her personal style for so long, making them hard to simply discard. That's when she thought of Christine, her younger cousin, who was just starting her career in the corporate world. Christine had always admired Rebecca's sense of style. She was in awe of her silk scarves, often commenting on their uniqueness and diversity. Rebecca knew that Christine would treasure them, wearing each silk scarf with joy and respect for its history. She also knew that the scarves would elevate Christine's professional attire, giving her the confidence she needed to thrive in her new role. So, one afternoon, Rebecca invited Christine over. After a brief catch-up and a cup of hot coffee, Rebecca led Christine to her room, opened her closet and unveiled her colorful collection of scarves. In handing them over, Rebecca did not just give away possessions; she passed on a part of herself, her sense of style, her memories. Christine was thrilled, not only about the gorgeous scarves but also about the sentiment behind them, making them even more special. Therefore, Rebecca gave all her silk scarves to Christine when she decided to declutter her closet. It was a cherishing moment that strengthened their bond, and marked a new chapter in Rebecca's life, shifting her towards a minimalist lifestyle."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer is:","completion":"Amir Sultan was captured by the Turco-Mongol conqueror, Timur, also known as Tamerlane or Timur the Lame. Timur was born on April 9, 1336, in Kesh, Transoxiana, near the city of Samarkand, which is now in modern-day Uzbekistan. He was a member of the Barlas tribe, a Mongol subgroup that had been Turkified in many aspects. Timur's ambition was to restore the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan, and in doing so, he embarked on a campaign of military conquest and expansion across Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. During his four-decade-long reign, Timur's endeavor led to the establishment of the Timurid Empire, which at its peak extended from present-day Iran to the borders of China, and from the Russian steppes to the Persian Gulf. Amir Sultan was a military commander and a member of the ruling family of the Jalayirid dynasty, which was one of the regional dynasties established in the aftermath of the disintegration of the Ilkhanate in the 14th century, and which ruled over Iraq, Azerbaijan, and parts of Iran. The Jalayirids originated from the Central Asian tribe of Jalayir, which was closely associated with Genghis Khan's empire. In 1393, Timur began his conquest of the western parts of the Jalayirid territories, including Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Amir Sultan was likely captured during Timur's invasion of the Jalayirid domain, which culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 1394. The fall of Baghdad marked the end of the Jalayirid dynasty, as Timur's forces razed the city to the ground and massacred a significant portion of the population. The capture of Amir Sultan was part of Timur's broader strategy to weaken his political rivals and consolidate his control over the territories he conquered. As a captive, Amir Sultan would have experienced various forms of treatment, ranging from punishment and humiliation to inclusion in Timur's court, depending on his level of cooperation and the conqueror's needs at the time. The defeat of the Jalayirids and the capture of Amir Sultan further solidified Timur's reputation as a formidable military leader and political strategist, and it played a crucial role in the expansion and consolidation of the Timurid Empire. In the years following this conquest, Timur continued to wage campaigns against other regional powers, such as the Mamluks of Egypt, the Golden Horde, and the Ottoman Empire, further asserting his dominance in the region before his death in 1405."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other..., what would be the answer ?

It's about the future of the music industry and how she has hope despite declining album sales (which, as many have noted, is easier to say when you are one of the only artists still selling albums by the million). A sample: \\"I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone.\\" Albums like hers, you see. Swift goes on to say that she does realize \\"it isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album,\\" but \\"that should challenge and motivate us.\\" To form that bond. To make that arrow album. To take those selfies: There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento \\"kids these days\\" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be \\"how may followers you have on Instagram. And can you guess whom she's talking about here? A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around. If Taylor's vision comes true, you'll be seeing lots more YouTube celebs and Vine stars crossing getting record deals. As for Taylor herself? Here is her parting wish: \\"I'd also like a nice garden.\\" ||||| Taylor Swift's essay for the Wall Street Journal's 125th anniversary issue has just gone up online, and never has the haunting chorus of Swift's runaway 2009 hit \\"You Belong With Me\\"— She wears short skirts. I wear T-shirts. She's Cheer Captain and I'm providing a logically sound if overly simplistic and only intermittently lucid analysis of the value of \\"albums in today's music marketplace. —rung so true. The essay is titled \\"For Taylor Swift, the Future of Music Is a Love Story.\\" There's a lot to love about \\"For Taylor Swift, the Future of Music Is a Love Story\\": the woodcut portrait of Swift that accompanies it; the multi-paragraph comparison of fans' relationships to romantic relationships that appears under the italicized subhed \\"Arrows Through the Heart.\\" There is, however, also a great deal that will have to be discussed during office hours. The basic gist of Swift's modest proposal is that Swift, a self-described \\"enthusiastic optimist,\\" who, according to Forbes estimates, made 64 million last year thanks to the music industry, believes that the music industry is not dying. She also thinks that music should not be free. But these observations, as Swift states again and again (three times total), are just her opinions. (\\"It's my opinion that music should not be free,\\" explains Swift, on the subject of should music be free.) At least one person in the music industry made 64 million last year. It's important to be an optimist and have a good attitude. Stylistically, Swift makes frequent ellipses in her writing, apparently as pauses for effect, rather than to indicate the intentional omission of words. Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive. Several of her sentences end with prepositions (\\"Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones [consumers] dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to)\\"); fewer with coherent thoughts (\\"My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it.\\"). The second sentence of one paragraph is devoted entirely to clearing up an imagined confusion regarding the words used in the sentence preceding it. I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say \\"shock\\"; I said \\"surprise.\\" Did Taylor Swift say \\"shock\\"? No. She swears to God she did not. If you truly believe she said \\"shock,\\" go back to the beginning of the paragraph and read it again. It is Taylor Swift's opinion that, upon doing so, you will quickly discover that she did not say \\"shock\\" until the sentence denying her initial use of that word. Of course, by now she has used \\"shock\\" multiple times. But that is a topic for another essay. At times, Taylor Swift's logic is so sound it becomes redundant, doubling back on itself to form a perfectly circular circle, as when she states that (in her opinion) the financial value of an album is based in part on its financial value. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Elsewhere, as on the topic of the scarcity of art, her logic seems stretched. Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. And occasionally mathematically sweaty. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Perhaps inevitably for a millionaire so famously humble, Swift's essay is peppered with humble brags. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us. In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. A friend of mine, who is an actress... I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. One thing Taylor Swift did not brag about: the shit-ass gardens junking up the premises of each of her multimillion dollar homes: And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism. And I'd also like a nice garden. Of course, it is Gawker's opinion that the entire essay is worth reading, particularly for fans of opinions. What can you do? She's better in rhyme.

From there on, the piece lets loose a spectacular string of metaphors, similes, and analogies comparing music to affairs of the heart. Which is to say, it’s exactly what you’d want from a Taylor Swift op-ed in America’s most prestigious business newspaper. Its major points: Artists and labels are just like underappreciated girlfriends. In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet … is that they all realize their worth and ask for it. Advertisement People treat music like romance. Get Slate in your inbox. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past. However, some artists will be like finding \\"the one.\\" We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. And if a couple can stay together for decades by occasionally mixing it up in the bedroom, so too can artists create long-term bonds with their fans. I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say \\"shock\\"; I said \\"surprise.\\" I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans? People will pay for music that makes them feel feelings. I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Taylor Swift shares her optimistic views on the future of the music industry.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books.

Obama Hails Poland as Model for Arab Nations in Upheaval Doug Mills/The New York Times President Obama walks with President Komorowski of Poland as reviews the troops during an arrival ceremony the Presidential Palace, in Warsaw, Poland on Saturday. Mr. Obama’s stop came at the end of a busy, six-day tour of Europe that served both as a reaffirmation of the trans-Atlantic alliance and a call for those European allies to advance the cause of those rallying for political change in the Middle East and North Africa. From Britain and France, Mr. Obama asked mainly for money to shore up the teetering economies of Egypt and Tunisia. But from Poland, the president sought something less tangible: inspiration, a kind of how-to manual from people who had taken a similar journey. “It has gone through what so many countries want to now go through,” Mr. Obama said at a news conference with Prime Minister Donald Tusk. “Poland can play an extraordinary role precisely because they have they have traveled so far so rapidly over the last 25 years.” Earlier, Mr. Obama met with elders of the Solidarity movement, which led the democratic uprising here, as well as young democracy activists just back from Tunisia, where they offered advice based on the Polish experience (Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, was not at the meeting; White House officials said he was out of the country). Reflecting on those encounters — here and in France, where he met with Egyptian and Tunisian leaders — Mr. Obama struck a cautious note about the trajectory of the Arab upheaval. The euphoria of the uprisings, he said, could easily give way to setbacks and disappointments. “What you have is a process that’s not always smooth,” Mr. Obama said. “There are going to be twists and turns, there are going to be occasions where you take one step forward and two steps back.” The critical element, he said, was to put institutions in place, so that new democratic governments can legally guarantee the rights of minorities and a free press, and that are resilient enough to survive the ethnic conflicts sure to arise in some countries. For Mr. Obama, who has struggled at times to fashion a response to the Arab uprisings, this week’s trip suggested he had settled on a guiding principle, which he voiced at every stop: while the West cannot dictate events, it must facilitate them. That applies to the United States, he said, even if it is burdened with fiscal deficits and a fragile economy. “I want the American people to understand that we’ve got to leave room for us to continue our tradition of providing leadership when it comes to freedom, democracy, human rights,” he said. Not all the visit was so high-minded. In Poland, as in Ireland on Monday, Mr. Obama reached out to countries with large emigrant populations that constitute potent voting blocs in the United States. “If you’ve lived in Chicago and you haven’t become a little bit Polish, then there’s something wrong with you,” he joked at the news conference. Mr. Obama’s 24-hour visit, which drew curious but not rapturous crowds to the street, also allowed him to address an issue that has frustrated Polish officials for years: the fact that Poland is not a member of the State Department’s visa waiver program, because it fails to meet the eligibility requirements under the current law. He announced he was throwing his support behind an effort under way in Congress to rewrite the law so that it uses different criteria, making it easier for Poland to qualify. Given the growing income of Polish tourists, who would be more apt to vacation in New York if they could get visas, he acknowledged there was some self-interest at work. “We very much want you to shop on Fifth Avenue, and anywhere else in the United States,” Mr. Obama said. In case the president missed the point, Prime Minister Tusk immediately added, “There are many other places in the world where you can buy and spend your money.” As he did on previous stops in Britain and France, the president described the trans-Atlantic alliance as the cornerstone of American security. That seemed calculated in part to answer those who say Mr. Obama has neglected Europe in favor of Asia. In Warsaw, the visit was also meant to reassure Poland that the administration’s “reset” of relations with Russia would not come at the expense of the Poles. On Friday, Russia drew closer to the United States on Libya, with President Dmitri A. Medvedev telling Mr. Obama in a meeting of the Group of 8 in France that he wanted Russia to play a role in easing out the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Mr. Obama also joined the Polish president, Bronislaw Komorowski, in condemning the repression in Belarus, a former Soviet republic, where dissidents and journalists have been jailed. The lingering suspicions between Poland and Russia were on display outside the gates of the presidential palace, where a crowd of protestors held up large placards asserting a Russian role in the 2010 plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, and many members of the Polish military and government establishment. Just before he left Warsaw, Mr. Obama paid his respects at a memorial for the victims of that crash, lighting a candle and gazing silently at their names on a brushed metal wall in a cathedral.

Wearing eyelashes can be so much fun, just like playing dress-up. But did you know there are some important steps we need to follow to make sure our eyes stay happy and healthy? Let's talk about the three key things we need to remember when putting on eyelashes. It's as easy as 1, 2, 3! 1. Wash your hands first! Our hands touch so many things, like our toys and coloring crayons, and they can collect invisible buggies called germs. Before putting on eyelashes, we need to wash our hands super well to make sure we don't accidentally put any germs near our eyes. To do this, just use soap and water, scrub your hands for about 20 seconds (that's like singing your ABCs twice), and rinse them with clean water. Dry your hands on a clean towel. Ta-da! Now you're ready for the next step. 2. Let your eye makeup dry. Before putting on eyelashes, you might want to wear some eye makeup, like sparkly eyeshadow or pretty eyeliner. Putting on makeup can be so much fun, but we need to be patient too. Just like waiting for your favorite cookies to bake, we need to give our eye makeup time to dry. This is important because if our makeup is still wet, it can make it harder for the eyelashes to stick on properly. So take a little break, maybe play with your favorite toy or read a story, and then come back to your eyelashes after your makeup has had time to dry. 3. Practice makes perfect. Just like riding a bike or tying your shoelaces, putting on eyelashes is a skill that takes practice. It might be tricky at first, like trying to catch a butterfly, but don't worry – the more you try, the better you'll get! Before wearing your eyelashes outside, practice putting them on at home. Grab a trusted grown-up and ask for their help if you need it. Keep practicing until you feel comfortable and confident! Well, there you have it, little ones – our simple guide on how to wear eyelashes safely and properly! Just remember to always wash your hands, let your makeup dry, and practice, practice, practice. Now go have fun and enjoy dressing up with your beautiful, fluttery eyelashes!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The day before yesterday, my uncle told me never to speak to him, his wife, or my two cousins again.Earlier, I made a joke. I didn't mean to hurt my aunt's feelings, but it did.I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth . crying as I spoke to a family friend who lived in England. When I left the phone booth, I went back to a silent house with three closed bedroom doors. In the morning, I heard everyone get up and leave for work and school. I wrote a note to say sorry and pulled my bags to the train station. When I got into London, I had to take the underground to Angel Station to get to my family friend's house. I was familiar with the underground, but at the time, it was just endless white tiles .Coming to England seemed like a bad decision. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the stairs. When I was trying hard to walk forward, there were hands. Each time I faced another group of steps,a hand would lift the suitcase. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next group. And just as I wanted to try again,another hand would appear. It happened several times.

PUBLISHED:. 07:52 EST, 19 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 18:28 EST, 19 November 2013. Security firm G4S has admitted overcharging taxpayers by more than £24million for ‘phantom’ electronic tags that had been removed – or were never fitted in the first place. But the Government yesterday refused to accept its offer of a ‘credit note’ for the sum and is expected to draw up its own bill once an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office is concluded. It is thought that G4S, and another tagging firm Serco, overcharged for tens of thousands of criminals, including those who had left the country, been returned to prison or even died. Ministers fear taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals. G4S said its investigation had ‘not identified any evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct’ by any of its staff. A spokesman said it accepted it ‘wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed’. The credit note issued yesterday was for £23.3million for bills wrongly issued between 2005, when the contracts began, and May this year. The firm said another note would follow for £800,000 for bills wrongly issued from June this year. This indicates the company continued to overcharge even after the Ministry of Justice announced its investigation into billing practices in May. Probe: Global security firm G4S is to be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over tagging contacts dating back more than a decade. A National Audit Office report into the electronic monitoring contracts published today found evidence the firms were charging for multiple tags on individual criminals. In one case Serco charged more than £15,000 for monitoring an offender whose home was not even fitted with the equipment. A spokesman said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has been clear that he is 'determined to secure a refund for the taxpayer'. The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901. G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including:. In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks. A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4. In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt. Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001. In. 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over. Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher. Lowcock's artificial limb. In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave. In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out. of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive' The spokesman added: 'We have taken appropriate legal advice and will pursue all possible avenues. 'This matter is now the subject of a criminal investigation. We are not able to comment further at the current time. We will make a further statement when it is appropriate to do so.' G4S refused to co-operate with a forensic audit of its work - and that of fellow contractor Serco - which a public spending watchdog revealed had already cost the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) more than £2 million. The firm said it now accepted it had ‘wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed’. It said: ‘This billing practice ... was not consistent with the contract or G4S’s values and the company has apologised to the Ministry of Justice and issued credit notes totalling £23.3 million for amounts incorrectly billed between 2005 and May 2013. ‘A further credit note of £0.8 million will be issued for billings for the period from June 2013 to date.’ There was no evidence that it extended to any of its other Government contracts, said the firm, which has faced repeated criticism of its performance, not least over security for the 2012 Olympics. G4S group chief executive Ashley Almanza said the offer was ‘an important step in setting this matter straight and restoring the trust which has been earned by our many thousands of committed and hard-working employees over many years’. G4S UK and Ireland chief executive Richard Morris will face questions from MPs over the scandal tomorrow when he appears before the Commons public accounts committee. Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ‘Privatisation has been imposed on the public with the lie that it is more efficient and saves us money. ‘As well as raking in billions of pounds of our money, these companies are shielded from public scrutiny and are almost entirely unaccountable. ‘Who knows how many more times we have been ripped off?’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said the admission by G4S was 'staggering' Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'The admission of G4S today is staggering. 'The company refused to co-operate with the Government, which led to the referral to the SFO, and that should have rung alarm bells. It represents serious corporate failure. 'Contracts of this kind need to be conducted in good faith and represent value for money. Every G4S contract with the Government needs to be reviewed immediately, and they should be banned from bidding for any more. 'After the Olympic shambles, the Home Affairs Select Committee recommended that the Government implement a high-risk register to stop this happening again. 'Had it been adopted, the overbilling from June may have been prevented.' The firms will be billed for the £2million cost of the audit that uncovered the overcharging.

Gameplay is planned to be a fusion of real-time action similar to Dissidia Final Fantasy, and strategic elements, and the game will be released as a multipart series. will final fantasy 7 remake be on pc?","completion":"Final Fantasy VII Remake is indeed a highly anticipated game, and fans are excited about its release. As you mentioned, the game was initially developed and published by Square Enix for PlayStation 4, with the first part of the multipart series being released on April 10, 2020. Regarding the question of whether Final Fantasy VII Remake will be available on PC, there has been no official confirmation from Square Enix at the moment. However, it is essential to note that the game was initially released on PS4 as a timed exclusive, with the exclusivity period lasting until April 10, 2021. Considering Square Enix's history of porting previous Final Fantasy titles to the PC platform, there is a strong possibility that Final Fantasy VII Remake will eventually be released on PC. Final Fantasy XV, for example, was initially a console-only game but was later released on PC. Moreover, many other mainline Final Fantasy games, as well as spin-offs, have made their way to PC platforms, such as Steam, in recent years. It is reasonable to assume that Square Enix would want to capitalize on the PC gaming market, expanding the reach of the Final Fantasy VII Remake to more players and platforms. However, until an official announcement is made, it remains uncertain. In conclusion, while there is no direct confirmation about Final Fantasy VII Remake being released on PC, the possibility is quite high due to the end of the timed exclusivity period and Square Enix's track record of porting their games to the PC platform. Fans may have to wait for an official announcement from the developers to know for sure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Select from: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","completion":"The premise given is that she is an orphan of the Voth war. This information can allow us to understand her personal history and circumstances to a certain extent. The hypothesis provided is that her parents were killed in the Voth war. To analyze if the hypothesis comes from the stated premise, we need to consider the possible reasons for her being an orphan and the context provided. Being an \\"orphan of the Voth war\\" generally implies that her parentage, or lack thereof, is directly related to the war itself. However, it does not explicitly state how her parents were lost or the exact circumstances behind their death or absence. There are several possible reasons for her being an orphan due to the war: 1. Her parents were killed in the war, as the hypothesis suggests. If this is the case, the premise would entail the hypothesis, making the answer option (1) - yes. 2. Her parents went missing during the war or were displaced by its aftermath, which resulted in her status as an orphan. In this scenario, the premise would not entail the hypothesis since her parents' deaths would not be confirmed. The answer would thus be option (3) - no. 3. Her parents were separated from her at birth because of the war. They might have given her up for adoption or placed her into hiding out of fear, uncertainty, or desperation. If this situation occurred, then her parents could still be alive, and her orphan status would be due to their absence, not their deaths. In this case, the premise would not entail the hypothesis, making the answer option (3) - no. Based on these possible explanations, we cannot definitively say that the premise entails the stated hypothesis without further information about her specific history. There may exist additional reasons that her orphan status is associated with the Voth war, which would also impact the connection between the premise and hypothesis. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Does the premise entail the hypothesis?\\" would be option (2) - it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The review highlights multiple issues with the film that the user criticizes, making it evident that they would not recommend it to others. Firstly, the reviewer states that the film does not present a coherent, logical point and is a combination of meandering, rambling diatribes. This shows dissatisfaction with the way the film presents its arguments and how it fails to convey its message effectively. Secondly, the review mentions that the film resorts to insults and appeals to emotions in defense of intelligent design, rather than providing actual evidence. This suggests that the user finds the film's methods of persuasion to be unsatisfactory and unconvincing due to the lack of substantive and fact-based arguments. Additionally, the reviewer points out that the anecdotal stories presented in the film are wildly altered and misleading, leading the viewer to question the accuracy and reliability of the information provided. The mention of doing a Google search for \\"Expelled Exposed\\" to find the truth behind the stories implies that the reviewer feels the film is not an honest representation of the issues surrounding intelligent design and evolution. Lastly, the quote from Christopher Hitchens included in the review further emphasizes the notion that the film is not a well-argued or sophisticated defense of intelligent design.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making a pool body board, you'll need to follow several steps that involve selecting materials, designing the shape, cutting and assembling parts, and perhaps adding extra features for comfort and safety. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you accomplish this goal: 1. Research and planning: a. Research different types of body boards available on the market to determine the style and features you'd like for your pool body board. b. Measure the dimensions of your pool to ensure the body board is an appropriate size. c. Consider the age range of users and think about any specific preferences or requirements they may have. 2. Select materials: a. Choose a material that is buoyant and lightweight, such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) foam or closed-cell foam. b. Select other materials needed for the project, such as waterproof adhesive, straps, leash, and any other desired accessories. 3. Design the shape: a. Outline the shape of your pool body board, considering factors like ergonomics, hydrodynamics, and the preference of users. Standard body board shapes typically include a crescent tail and have a slightly tapered nose. b. Measure and mark the dimensions of your body board design on your sheet of foam material. 4. Cut and shape the body board: a. Using a sharp utility knife, carefully cut the foam material according to the marked dimensions from step 3. b. Smooth any rough edges to ensure they won't cause any discomfort or injury during use. A rasp or sandpaper can be helpful for this process. c. Slightly bevel the edges of the body board to improve its hydrodynamic performance. 5. Assemble and add features: a. If you would like to incorporate different layers or materials (such as a slick bottom layer), use waterproof adhesive to bond them together. b. Attach a leash to the board to ensure it stays close to the user and doesn't get lost in the pool. You can do this by either screwing a leash plug into the board and attaching the leash or using an adhesive to attach a leash loop to the board. c. Attach straps or handles to the body board if desired. This can provide users with a better grip on the board, especially for younger or less experienced users. d. Add any other desired accessories, such as a cushioned deck pad for enhanced comfort, or even swim fins for increased maneuverability. 6. Test and refine: a. Test your pool body board with its intended users to ensure it performs well and meets their needs. b. Make necessary adjustments based on feedback, such as modifying the shape, adding more padding, or altering the leash length. 7. Final touches: a. Apply any desired aesthetic touches, such as painting or adding decals to the pool body board. b. To seal and protect your board, you may want to apply a thin layer of waterproofing sealant or wax. c. Allow any adhesive, paint, or sealant to dry completely before using the body board in the pool. By following these detailed steps, you can create a custom pool body board that meets your needs and preferences, providing hours of fun and exercise in the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve -9 = -685*q + 686*q for q.","completion":"To find the value of q in the given equation, you must first simplify the equation and then isolate q. The given equation is: -9 = -685*q + 686*q Step 1: Combine the 'q' terms: Since both terms on the right-hand side of the equation are the product of q and constants, you can combine them by adding the coefficients. (-685*q) + (686*q) = (686 - 685) * q This simplifies to: -9 = 1*q Step 2: Isolate 'q': Now that you have simplified the equation, you must isolate the variable q to determine its value. You can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of q, which is 1 in this case. -9 / 1 = (1*q) / 1 This simplifies to: -9 = q So, the value of q that satisfies the given equation is q = -9."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 43-year-old retired from the game last July following a career which saw him score 114 first-class centuries for Middlesex and Surrey and play 52 Tests for England. Ramprakash is now back at Middlesex, where he made his first-class debut as a 17-year-old in 1987 and spent 14 years as a player, as batting coach on a two-year deal. And although he is enjoying giving advice to younger players, he still misses the thrill of playing himself. A huge part of me coming back to Middlesex was the fact that Angus Fraser is director of cricket \\"It has been very different,\\" he told BBC London 94.9. \\"I certainly miss the playing side and still wish I could still strap on the pads. I looked at the nets at Lord's before the start of the season. They were in great condition and I was itching to have a bat, but it is very different as a coach. \\"It is early days but I am enjoying the opportunity to try and build some relationships with the players. I have found it very rewarding to try and help them.\\" Ramprakash scored more than 35,000 first-class runs at an average of 53.14, reaching the landmark of a hundred centuries in 2008. Former Surrey and England captain Alec Stewart labelled him \\"the best domestic cricketer of the last 15 to 20 years\\", while former Middlesex seam bowler Simon Hughes expressed the view that his credentials \\"could make a supreme cricketer an even more supreme coach\\". Ramprakash also provides coaching for the England and Wales Cricket Board, but his principal focus is on tailoring his work at Lord's to meet the individual needs of the Middlesex squad. \\"The players have got a good work ethic and they are willing to learn. It is a case of slowly but surely working with the player to find out what works for them,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully with the things I have learned throughout my career in the game, I can impart some of that as and when it is needed. \\"So far I have found it rewarding if a player takes something and finds that it helps. \\"There are players like Steven Finn and Eoin Morgan, who are England regulars, but by and large there is a talented group here who are around their early to mid-20s. \\"From my point of view, I want to see people like Joe Denly, Dawid Malan and Neil Dexter push on. They are coming to their peak years as batsmen and I am looking forward to working with them to help them achieve their potential.\\" Ramprakash spent the last 12 years of his playing career with rivals Surrey, but after calling time at the Oval midway through last season, he has found it easy settling back into life north of the Thames. \\"I feel very comfortable in the environment,\\" he said. \\"A huge part of me coming back to Middlesex was the fact that Angus Fraser is [managing] director of cricket. \\"I know Angus very well and I think since he has been in his role he has helped create a lot of stability around the club. \\"Along with Richard Scott and Richard Johnson [head coach and assistant coach], I think Middlesex have a relaxed atmosphere, but we are well aware we want to keep raising the bar.\\" Middlesex finished third in the County Championship last season and, after two wins from their opening three games in 2013, Ramprakash believes the side are on the brink of a new era of success. However, he warns that the squad will have to get their mental approach correct if they are to lift silverware. \\"I am really interested to see how the players develop throughout the season,\\" he said. \\"It is an open Championship. The feeling I get around the Middlesex squad is that I would love them to take the next step mentally; to believe they are winners and they can go on and win the County Championship and other trophies. \\"You have to believe. It is a way of thinking that you are in it to win it. \\"That is a very important element that Middlesex are now ready to try and take hold of. It is not about staying in Division One. \\"I think the time is right, in the next few years, for Middlesex to really say 'We have got a good, stable team.

How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","completion":"The sentence, \\"They were married on May 7, 1948.\\" is already correctly capitalized. In English sentences, the first letter of the first word is always capitalized. In this case, the word \\"They\\" is appropriately capitalized. Additionally, the names of months, like \\"May\\", are always capitalized in English. Therefore, it is correct in the sentence. Lastly, the period at the end is aptly placed, marking the end of the sentence. Therefore, no more capitalization or other punctuation changes are needed; the sentence is accurate in its current form. It's important to pay attention to capitalization rules for proper nouns, the first word of a sentence, and special titles or names in English sentences. Major errors can unexpectedly happen when these rules are overlooked, and the clarity of the text may be compromised. Misused capitalization can be distracting or confusing for readers, often making the text look unprofessional or careless. Therefore, always ensure correct usage in your writings. Additionally, checking for the correct capitalization becomes even more critical in academic, professional, and formal contexts, where the quality of a text is equated with the writer's credibility and understanding. Users of the English language, both native and non-native speakers, should aim to understand and apply capitalization rules accurately to their writings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the creator of the style that is thought to be the first to descend from the one reported in a journal in 1849?, using the article: Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, shin-daiko..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The full name of the creator of the first style of Hachijō-daiko, which is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kakuso Kizan in 1849, is Okuyama Kumaoji.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide? In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

A:","completion":"The Coronation Street tram crash, also known as the 50th-anniversary tram crash, occurred in December 2010 and was a major event in the long-running British soap opera, Coronation Street. The show was celebrating its 50th anniversary, and the tram crash was the central storyline for the celebratory week. This dramatic event saw a tram derail from the viaduct above the famous cobbled street, causing massive destruction and impacting the lives of many characters. Several characters were either killed or injured in the tragic accident. The following characters died as a result of the tram crash: 1. Ashley Peacock (played by Steven Arnold): Ashley was a long-standing character on the show, having first appeared in 1995. As a part of the tram crash storyline, Ashley heroically attempted to save Peter Barlow (played by Chris Gascoyne) from the wreckage of The Joinery bar. However, moments after pulling Peter to safety, the ceiling of the bar collapsed, killing Ashley. 2. Molly Dobbs (played by Vicky Binns): Molly was a popular character who had been part of the show since 2005. During the tram crash, Molly was in the Corner Shop with her baby, Jack. The shop's roof collapsed from the impact of the crash, trapping both of them under the rubble. Sally Webster (played by Sally Dynevor) and Sunita Alahan (played by Shobna Gulati) managed to save Molly's baby, but Molly didn't survive the incident. Before her death, she confessed to Sally that she had an affair with Sally's then-husband, Kevin Webster (played by Michael Le Vell), and that Jack was Kevin's son. In addition to the deaths of Ashley Peacock and Molly Dobbs, several cast members were injured during the tram crash, creating a significant impact on the characters and storylines in the months that followed. Among the injured were Rita Tanner (played by Barbara Knox), Fiz Stape (played by Jennie McAlpine), and Peter Barlow. The tram crash remains one of Coronation Street's most memorable storylines and marked a significant moment in British television history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - A nickname is a substitute for the proper name of a familiar person, place, or thing, for affection or ridicule. - A name is a term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a \\"specific\\" individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \\"common names\\" or (obsolete) \\"general names\\". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \\"the throne\\" or \\"the crown\\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland. - Dead Run is the third book by mother and daughter authors P. J. Tracy. It follows on from their first and second books, \\"Want to Play?\\" and \\"Live Bait\\" and has the same principal characters. - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - A stage name, also called a screen name, is a pseudonym used by performers and entertainers such as actors, comedians, and musicians. - Monkeewrench (released later in the United Kingdom as \\"Want to Play?\\"), is the first novel by author team P. J. Tracy. It revolves around the search for a copycat killer, who is recreating murders found in a new computer game. It also seems that the killer is linked to the computer programmers who made the game. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an \\"anagrammatist\\". The original word or phrase is known as the \\"subject\\" of the anagram. Anagrams are often used as a form of mnemonic device as well. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring. - P. J. Tracy is a pseudonym for American mother - daughter writing team Patricia ( P. J. ) and Traci Lambrecht .

Plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\". Moses defends himself against the charges, arguing that he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier and proves his point with the impressive progress he is making. Rameses had earlier been charged by Sethi with finding out whether there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer.

Information: - Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels. Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.30.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.38.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected.

Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician. - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life. - Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 23% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic cases account for 3050% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013. - Jean H. Dussault , ( 1941 -- March 23 , 2003 ) was a Canadian endocrinologist . He helped develop a blood test for the early detection of congenital hypothyroidism , a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth due to untreated congenital deficiency of thyroid hormones . Born in Quebec City , Quebec , Dussault received a bachelor 's degree from the Université de Montréal in 1960 and a Doctor of Medicine in 1965 from the Université Laval . He took his residency in Medicine at the Enfant - Jesus Hospital in Quebec City and additional research training at the University of Toronto and UCLA . In 1971 , he joined the department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the Faculté de médecine - Université Laval . In 1982 , he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine . In 1988 , he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was awarded the Ernest C. Manning Awards Foundation Innovation Award for having \`\` formulated a method of testing infants for congenital hypothyroidism , thus saving children from irreversible mental retardation '' .

December has already seen communities in Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire swamped by rising waters. Prime Minister David Cameron has defended government spending on flood defences after the devastation across northern England. There are already nine severe flood warnings - meaning \\"danger to life\\" - in England and Wales, mostly around York which was flooded on Saturday. The Met Office issued amber weather warnings - meaning \\"be prepared\\" - for rain in Strathclyde; Central, Tayside and Fife; Dumfries, Galloway, Lothian and Borders; and North West England for Wednesday. There are also yellow weather warnings - meaning \\"be aware\\" - for rain for the rest of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, North East England and Yorkshire and Humber. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency warned Storm Frank could bring further flooding to Scotland. Wales is also bracing itself for more rain. Floods minister Rory Stewart told the BBC that the government would spend Â£2.3 billion on flood defences over six years. \\"There are going to be different parts of the country where people are going to be pushing for bigger schemes,\\" Mr Stewart said. \\"We have to try to be fair, we're putting a lot of money into this and we're making sure we're spending it in the most cost effective way we can.\\" The government has ordered a major inspection into how it is planning to prevent floods in the future. But the Labour Party's John McDonnell said that \\"a long term cross-party plan\\" was needed to help solve the issue of flooding and any review must include the views of experts on the ground. Liberal Democrat party leader Tim Farron said extra funding was needed for flood defences, and said Prime Minister David Cameron needed to \\"show he cares about the North by following up his words with deeds\\".

Putting on lotion after will help your skin be moisturized and warm. Magnesium helps with insomnia by decreasing the amount of time it takes to fall asleep. It can also increase the quality and length that you sleep. Magnesium supplements can be purchased in the vitamin section of your pharmacy. According to sleep specialists at the Cleveland Sleep Clinic, sleeping in the nude helps you regulate your temperature. Get a comfortable temperature using blankets or duvet (of suitable warmth), sheets, and pillows. It is usually best to be slightly on the cool side. Preferably sleep with your arms and head out from under the bedclothes, unless the room is very cold. Feeling too hot? Learn how to sleep comfortably on a hot night. Feeling too cold? Learn how to sleep when it's cold. Keep an extra blanket right by the bed, just in case you get cold at night. Don't neglect your feet—cold feet can keep you awake! If you prefer to wear pajamas because they're more comfortable, loose cotton pajamas are the best as they as a rule breathe more easily than other fabrics. Changing your sleeping position can make a huge difference in the quality of your sleep. When you go to sleep, or if you wake up in the middle of the night, make a conscious effort to follow these guidelines until it becomes habitual: Keep your body in a \\"mid-line\\" position, where both your head and neck are kept roughly straight. This should help you sleep. Avoid sleeping on your stomach. It's difficult to maintain the proper position, and it is more likely to cause aches and pains. If you wish to sleep on your stomach, put your pillow under your hips instead of under your head. If it's too thin, your head will tilt backwards, which is uncomfortable. Likewise, don't stack your pillows so that your head is propped at an angle. Try placing a pillow between your legs if you sleep on your side. This will support your hips and make this position more comfortable. Try placing a pillow under your legs if you sleep on your back. Bright light before bedtime can disrupt your body's internal clock. It's one of the primary clues to the body that it's either sleep time, or waking time. If your home is brightly lit late at night, turn off lights you do not need. Stop watching TV and using a computer, tablet or phone at least 2 hours before bedtime. It is recommended to install f.lux or Redshift (if you use linux) onto your computer, which filters blue light from your screen. Blue light can negatively affect your sleep by decreasing the release of sleep hormones. Eliminate all sources of light in your bedroom. This includes windows, LED clocks, computer lights, cable boxes, and other devices with lights (unless they are very dim). You can cover them with heavy paper, cloth covers, masking tape, or just unplug them. Not only will you get a good night's sleep, but you'll also save electricity. If light still disturbs you or wakes you up in in the morning, wear an eye mask. Sometimes lavender eye \\"pillows\\" can be more relaxing. Use a white noise generator that generates various soothing sounds—surf, wind, steam—these are sounds that have no shape, and they can help your brain to de-focus on right now. White noise has been shown to not only help people fall asleep more quickly, but also it can disguise other noises that may wake you during the night. White noise or natural sound machines are often wonderful. But if you cannot afford one, a fan can make soothing noise. So can a radio tuned to \\"between stations\\", where it creates static. Make sure that the radio is not too loud. Repetitive or ambient music is very good for falling asleep. What's especially important is that there be no dramatic shifts in the dynamics of the music. Ambient music, such as that produced by Brian Eno, is ideal. Just be sure that the music stops or fades out in about an hour, or it could keep you from experiencing really deep sleep. Turn your phone off, or to silent mode (if you use its alarm), so you will not be disturbed with texts, phone calls, and notifications. If you know that you have to be somewhere go to bed earlier. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article focuses on various strategies to improve sleep quality and make falling asleep easier. It discusses the benefits of taking a warm bath and using magnesium supplements for relaxation and better sleep.

Article: The ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, a town destructed for the fourth time in 14 years by a major tornado , are a reminder that current building codes can't do much to prevent property destruction and loss of life, especially when a powerful tornado cuts through town. But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms. In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms. \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said. Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced. As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction.

He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. and a hint : Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is Robert is generating waves using an oscilloscope in his high school physics class. As part of the experiment, Robert first has to create waves with a long wavelength, waves that we will call long waves. Afterwards, Robert has to create waves with a short wavelength, waves that we will call short waves. Which waves will have a higher frequency? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's revisit the relationship between wavelength and frequency. As mentioned, wavelength and frequency are inversely related. That means, as the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases and vice versa. In other words, if a wave has a longer wavelength, it will have a lower frequency, and if a wave has a shorter wavelength, it will have a higher frequency. Now, let's analyze the situation with Robert's waves: 1. Long waves: Robert generates waves with a long wavelength. As the wavelength is longer for these waves, their frequency must be lower due to the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency. 2. Short waves: Robert generates waves with a short wavelength. As the wavelength is shorter for these waves, their frequency must be higher due to the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency. So, based on the given information and the relationship between wavelength and frequency, the short waves that Robert generates will have a higher frequency. Answer: The short waves will have a higher frequency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: Q: What can be switched off by a protein called the trp repressor? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - the cytokine - the chaperone protein - the genetic precursor - the operon A: Answer:","completion":"The trp repressor is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan in bacteria. The correct option from the provided answers is the operon. To understand the function of the trp repressor, it's essential to know about the trp operon. The trp operon is a cluster of genes (typically five genes) that work collectively to synthesize tryptophan, an essential amino acid for building proteins in bacteria. This operon follows the principles of gene regulation, where genes can be turned on or off depending on the presence of specific regulatory proteins or environmental conditions. When the bacterium has enough tryptophan, the trp repressor comes into play. The trp repressor is a protein that binds to tryptophan and undergoes a conformational change. This altered protein can now bind to a specific DNA sequence called the operator, which is part of the trp operon. By binding to the operator, the trp repressor impedes the function of the RNA polymerase enzyme, which is required for transcribing the genes in the trp operon. Consequently, the RNA polymerase cannot transcribe the genes for the enzymes required to synthesize tryptophan. This \\"switching off\\" or repression of the trp operon is an example of negative feedback regulation, as the end product of the pathway (tryptophan) regulates its own synthesis by inhibiting the genes required for its production. In summary, the trp repressor is responsible for switching off the trp operon when the bacterium has an ample supply of tryptophan, thereby conserving resources and maintaining a balance of the amino acid within the cell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings.

He took a picture of the table at the Roseville restaurant on Wednesday and posted it on Facebook (FB). Williams said he alerted the managers and other staffers, some of whom were African-American. \\"The rest of the black staff didn't know it was there,\\" said Williams, even though they told him the table, which has the image laminated on top, had been there for 10 years. \\"And they came over to see it and they were shocked and appalled.\\" He said the manager was apologetic and that Williams \\"kind of felt bad for him, having to deal with that.\\" He and his friend Chauntyll Allen were offered a free meal, which they declined. Williams said he's experienced racist backlash since posting the photo. \\"I woke up this morning to about a hundred or so hate mails and it shows where we are in America right now,\\" he said. \\"Hatred is still alive.\\" Joe's Crab Shack, which has 130 locations, posted an apology on Facebook.

At a press conference with the Minneapolis NAACP they described what they saw and demanded an apology. (TheUpTake.org) Tyrone Williams and Chauntyll Allen said they went to Joe’s Crab Shack in Roseville, Minn., on Wednesday night for a friend’s early birthday dinner when they looked down at their table and saw it: a photograph, embedded inside of the table, depicting the public hanging of a black man. “It had a cartoon character saying, ‘All I said was “I didn’t like the gumbo,'” in a joking manner,” Williams said at a news conference Thursday. “I’m appalled,” Allen said at the news conference, organized by the Minneapolis NAACP. “I don’t understand why they think this is some kind of joke, the trauma we endured on our black body.” Williams snapped a photo of the image titled “Hanging at Groesbeck, Texas on April 12, 1895″ and contacted the Minneapolis chapter of the civil rights organization. Ignite Restaurant Group, Joe’s Crab Shack’s parent company, has since apologized for what it described as an offensive photo. “We take this matter very seriously, and the photo in question was immediately removed,” Ignite Chief Operating Officer David Catalano said in a statement, KARE reported. “We sincerely apologize to our guests who were disturbed by the image, and we look forward to continuing to serve the Roseville community.” [Even more black people were lynched in the U.S. than previously thought, study finds] While pleased that the photo was removed from the Roseville restaurant, Minneapolis NAACP president Nekima Levy-Pounds said in an interview Friday that “there are broader concerns about whether that type of racist decor exists in other Joe’s Crab Shack locations.” “We have not seen a commitment from Ignite Restaurant Group that they will examine the decor in all of its restaurants and remove racist material,” Levy-Pounds told The Washington Post. Williams and Allen alerted the Roseville manager of the photo soon after they saw it. “He was apologetic and understanding,” Williams said. But the pair already felt “sick, confused,” and left the restaurant. The scene depicted in the Joe’s Crab Shack table was the public hanging of Richard Burleson, a black man, who was convicted of murdering J.G. McKinnon, a white man. [Students’ ‘inappropriate’ KKK skit prompts school district apology in Pennsylvania] During the 1800s and early 1900s, it was common practice to produce postcards of public lynchings and executions. They were considered souvenirs of public violence, and horrifying images carried joking captions such a “You missed a good time” or “This is the barbecue we had last night.” The Postmaster General in 1908 finally banned sending the postcards through the mail service. “In 2016 we should not tolerate racist imagery in any of our establishment, let alone a family-friendly restaurant,” Levy-Pounds said. “It is our hope that incidents like this will not happen again, and that restaurants will be respectful of American American history and heritage, and not make a mockery of the oppression we have endured.” ||||| CLOSE Diners at Joe's Crab Shack in Roseville, Minn. received an unpleasant surprise at dinner when they saw a picture of two black men being lynched as part of the decorations next to their table.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ernest Edward \\"Ernie\\" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 - January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer. Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live. Kovacs's father Andrew emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton. Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City. During this time, he watched many \\"Grade B\\" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later. A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit. Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it \\"Kovacs Unlimited\\".

Today, we're going to talk about a time long, long ago when there was a big fight in a pretty place called Navarre. Are you ready to learn about it? Great! Let's begin. Once upon a time, in a land called Spain, there was a region named Navarre. A long, long time ago, around the year 1500, there were lots of people who lived in Navarre, but they didn't always agree on things. Sometimes, when people don't agree, they might argue or even fight. That's what happened in Navarre. This big disagreement turned into something called open warfare. Open warfare means that people were fighting and trying to hurt each other for a very long time. It's not very nice. Now, you might be wondering, how many years did the open warfare in Navarre last? Well, my little friend, it means the fight went on for about 10 years. That's a long time to be arguing and fighting, isn't it? Everyone in Navarre was very sad and upset with all the fighting going on. But after those 10 years, the fighting stopped, and the people in Navarre slowly started to work together again. They learned that it's much better to talk and sort things out, instead of fighting. And that, my dear little ones, is the story of the open warfare in Navarre that lasted 10 years. Always remember, it's better to use your words to solve problems than to fight. Now you know a fascinating piece of history that you can share with your friends and family!

To provide a detailed and accurate response to your question, let's break down the information contained in the suggested answer and then address the main query about the timing of the Proclamation. The suggested answer presents three key points about the Emancipation Proclamation: 1. It did not compensate slave owners. 2. It did not outlaw slavery. 3. It did not make ex-slaves (or freedmen) citizens. While these points do provide some background information about the Emancipation Proclamation, they do not answer the question about when Abraham Lincoln wrote it. To correctly address your query, here is the necessary information: Abraham Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862. This announcement informed the public that, unless the Confederate states returned to the Union by January 1, 1863, all slaves in those states would be declared free. Lincoln followed through on this warning and issued the final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. This executive order declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states \\"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\\" As for the points mentioned in the suggested answer, it is essential to understand that the Emancipation Proclamation had its limitations. While it declared slaves living in the Confederate states to be free, it did not apply to slaves in the border states that remained part of the Union. The Proclamation also did not outlaw slavery or establish citizenship for freed slaves. These issues were later addressed with the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. To conclude, you should not validate the suggested answer as it does not directly and accurately answer the question about when Abraham Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. Instead, the appropriate response would be that Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, and the final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All I can say about yesterday’s developments is that they seem potentially disastrous and also indicative to me of something truly weird going on underneath all of this. Benedict XVI has claimed that his almost unprecedented resignation came about simply because of his physical infirmity in the face of what appears to be a growing vortex of sexual and financial scandal inside the Vatican. He said he would quietly disappear to serve the church through prayer and meditation. But we now realize he’s going nowhere. He’s staying in the Vatican’s walls, and retaining the honorific “His Holiness.” He will keep white robes. His full title will be Pope Emeritus. Far from wearing clerical black, returning to the title of Bishop of Rome, and disappearing into a monastery in Bavaria, he’s going to be a shadow Pope in the Vatican. And this, we are told, was his decision: The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Benedict himself had made the decision in consultation with others, settling on “Your Holiness Benedict XVI” and either emeritus pope or emeritus Roman pontiff. Lombardi said he didn’t know why Benedict had decided to drop his other main title: bishop of Rome. If you were trying to avoid any hint of meddling, of a Deng Xiao Peng-type figure pulling strings behind the scenes, you would not be doing this. The only thing the Pope will give up, apparently, are his red Prada shoes. He has some fabulous brown leather artisanal ones to replace them. But this is what really made me sit up straight, so to speak: Benedict’s trusted secretary, Monsignor Georg Gänswein, will be serving both pontiffs — living with Benedict at the monastery inside the Vatican and keeping his day job as prefect of the new pope’s household. Asked about the potential conflicts, Lombardi was defensive, saying the decisions had been clearly reasoned and were likely chosen for the sake of simplicity. “I believe it was well thought out,” he said. So Benedict’s handsome male companion will continue to live with him, while working for the other Pope during the day. Are we supposed to think that’s, well, a normal arrangement? I wrote a while back about Gänswein’s intense relationship with Ratzinger, while noting Colm Toibin’s review of Angelo Quattrochi’s exploration of Benedict, “Is The Pope Gay?”. Here’s Toibin getting to some interesting stuff: Gänswein is remarkably handsome, a cross between George Clooney and Hugh Grant, but, in a way, more beautiful than either. In a radio interview Gänswein described a day in his life and the life of Ratzinger, now that he is pope: The pope’s day begins with the seven o’clock Mass, then he says prayers with his breviary, followed by a period of silent contemplation before our Lord. Then we have breakfast together, and so I begin the day’s work by going through the correspondence. Then I exchange ideas with the Holy Father, then I accompany him to the ‘Second Loggia’ for the private midday audiences. Then we have lunch together; after the meal we go for a little walk before taking a nap. In the afternoon I again take care of the correspondence. I take the most important stuff which needs his signature to the Holy Father. When asked if he felt nervous in the presence of the Holy Father, Gänswein replied that he sometimes did and added: ‘But it is also true that the fact of meeting each other and being together on a daily basis creates a sense of “familiarity”, which makes you feel less nervous. But obviously I know who the Holy Father is and so I know how to behave appropriately. There are always some situations, however, when the heart beats a little stronger than usual.’ This man – clearly in some kind of love with Ratzinger (and vice-versa) will now be working for the new Pope as secretary in the day and spending the nights with the Pope Emeritus. This is not the Vatican. It’s Melrose Place.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Cornvelious Daniel is portrayed as a witty and fast-thinking character, with Nathan Fillion's excellent voice acting giving depth and charisma to the role. The character is engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Rick throughout the episode, trying to draw out the formula for inter-dimensional travel that the Galactic Federation desperately wants. However, he ultimately underestimates Rick's cunning, resourcefulness, and sheer intellect, leading to his ultimate demise. Nathan Fillion's distinct voice acting and charisma are essential in making Cornvelious Daniel a memorable character, despite his brief appearance in the series. His contribution to Rick and Morty helps to solidify the show's status as one of the most critically acclaimed and well-loved animated television series in recent history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fujian is the province where both proposed routes would begin. There is direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air and sea at the moment. Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later, although there is a lack of government funding . There are no technical problems to build a Taiwan tunnel. But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits . A professor of Tsinghua University said, \\"A special feature of huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the period of construction.\\" For example, he said, the English Channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries.

If Stop off at Tirumalai's Palace, about a kilometer southeast of the Great Temple., can we conclude that \\"Tirumalai's Palace can be seen from the entrance of the Great Temple.\\"?","completion":"If Tirumalai's Palace is around a kilometer southeast of the Great Temple, it is not necessarily a guarantee that the palace can be seen from the entrance of the Great Temple. To conclude that the palace can be seen from the entrance, several factors should be taken into consideration. 1. Line of sight: A direct line of sight from the entrance of the Great Temple to Tirumalai's Palace is necessary for clear visibility. If there are any natural or man-made obstructions such as trees, hills, buildings, or walls in the path, it would impede the ability to see the palace from the entrance. 2. Topography: The landscape or terrain between the Great Temple and Tirumalai's Palace might affect visibility. If there are any elevations or depressions in the terrain, it could impact the line of sight and hinder visibility. In addition, the curvature of the Earth might also play a small role in the visibility due to the distance involved. 3. Atmospheric conditions: Factors such as the weather, dust, smog, or air pollution might reduce the visibility between the two locations. For instance, on a foggy day, it would be tough to see a structure that is a kilometer away, even if there are no other obstructions in the way. 4. Size and architectural features of Tirumalai's Palace: The palace's size and architectural design may also play a role in its visibility from a distance. A taller and larger structure may be easier to see than a smaller, less prominent one. Similarly, architectural features such as domes, towers, or brightly colored paints can enhance the palace's visibility, making it easier to spot from afar. 5. Viewing angle and position: The angle and position from where an individual is standing at the entrance of the Great Temple would play a role in the visibility of Tirumalai's Palace. Some viewpoints might offer a clear line of sight, while others might be obstructed by infrastructure or other components of the temple. In conclusion, it is crucial to consider these factors to gauge the visibility of Tirumalai's Palace from the entrance of the Great Temple. While its location of about a kilometer southeast of the Great Temple suggests that it might be visible under ideal conditions, there is no definitive answer without evaluating the specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the star has less mass happens, how will it affect the red giant is smaller. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this context, refers to the idea that if a star has less mass than a typical star, it might lead to a smaller red giant during its evolution. This variation in mass can indeed have a direct effect on the star's life cycle and subsequent stages, including the red giant phase. Here's a breakdown of the impact of a lower mass on the star's evolution: 1. Lower Mass: If a star has a lower mass, it will have less gravitational pressure at its core, leading to a slower rate of nuclear fusion compared to a more massive star. Consequently, the star will have a longer life on the main sequence since it will take longer to burn through its available hydrogen fuel. 2. Red Giant Formation: With a lower mass, the star might become a smaller red giant compared to a higher-mass star. Once the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will start to contract until the core reaches a high enough temperature to initiate helium fusion. However, the lower mass may result in a less intense helium flash and a less expanded outer envelope during this phase, leading to a smaller red giant. 3. Post-Red Giant Evolution: The smaller red giant's core will continue to contract after helium fusion is completed. With less mass, the remnant core will more easily shed its outer layers, releasing gas and forming a planetary nebula. Depending on the star's initial mass, it may not create heavy elements like carbon and oxygen, which can be produced in more massive stars. 4. White Dwarf Formation: The star's reduced mass will also affect its final stage as a white dwarf. The remnant core will cool and contract, eventually becoming a white dwarf with a mass corresponding to the original star's lower mass. This decrease in mass can lead to a less massive and less dense white dwarf than would be seen in more massive stars. In summary, the perturbation effect of lower mass on a star will have a direct impact on its life cycle, altering the size of the red giant, the intensity of the helium flash, and the mass of the final white dwarf. The star's lower mass will lead to a longer main-sequence life, a smaller red giant phase, and a less massive white dwarf at the end of its evolution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which class of animals would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B? Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.

While gazing at the image of a pumpkin patch, a dozen decayed arms punch through the wall clutching at her....She wakes from this surreal horror in the back of a helicopter. She's reminded she is living a real nightmare, looking down over a deserted Florida city, in which they land near an abandoned harbor. She is part of a team searching for survivors of a gruesome crisis that began almost a year earlier, a plague that started mysteriously and eventually collapsed human civilization. Her sometimes lover Miguel, an overworked and nerve-wracked soldier, calls for survivors on a bullhorn as they stand on the edge of the street of this now decaying town. Amid the scattered palm fronds, a newspaper blows in the death-scented wind near an early century federal building. It's big bold headline: THE DEAD WALK!

Milan Karki, who is 18 years old and lives in a village, used human hair to replace silicon, which is a common but expensive part of solar panels. By using hair as a replacement, Karki says that solar panels can be produced for around PS 23. Karki got the idea from a Stephen Hawking book, which explained how to create energy from hair. The device that Karki has showed can produce 18w of energy -- plenty to _ a mobile phone. \\"Half a kilo of hair can be bought for only 16p in Nepal and last a few months; but a pack of batteries would cost 50p and last a few nights,\\" according to The Daily Mail. The solar panel is easy to service as the hair is easy to replace. Karki has now sent out several devices to other places near his home for testing. He said, \\"First I wanted to provide energy for my home, then my village. Now I am thinking for the whole world.\\" The answer is:","completion":"What innovation allowed Milan Karki to create a low-cost solar panel using human hair? A.

Please briefly summarize this news article: MMA Fighting Stances: Mixed martial arts intelligence from the cage and ring Canadian mixed martial arts will get its biggest showcase yet in the Ultimate Fighting Championship's upcoming show. UFC comes to Ontario for the first time, carried by a wave of 55,000 tickets sold for Saturday's event at Toronto's Rogers Centre to create the largest live crowd the organization has seen to date. Five of the seven fights planned for live broadcast from UFC 129 (7 p.m. ET, online Facebook stream; 8 p.m. ET, Spike TV; 9 p.m. ET, pay-per-view) feature Canadian athletes, including the main event and co-main event. Expect the loudest cheers for welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre, Canada's greatest fighter and one of the two best mixed martial artists in the world at any weight, at least in the eyes of UFC President Dana White. If anyone can come close to matching St. Pierre's support on Saturday, it will be Mark Hominick, UFC's top contender at 145 pounds and a native of London, Ontario. A rundown of notable fights for Saturday's show: Welterweight title: Georges \\"Rush\\" St. Pierre (21-2) vs. Jake Shields (26-4-1) STORY LINE: The former Strikeforce middleweight titleholder tries to ruin St. Pierre's Canadian party. A Shields win would also upset UFC's hopes for a St. Pierre-Anderson Silva superfight. CASE FOR ST. PIERRE: Excels in all areas of mixed martial arts. As long as the fighters remain standing, St. Pierre has a clearcut edge in striking technique. On the ground, he won't be as outclassed as most of Shields' previous opponents. Calm, measured demeanor preserves his energy for five rounds and ensures that he will stick to the tactics devised by trainers Firas Zahabi and Greg Jackson, two of the best game planners in the business. CASE FOR SHIELDS: If there's one area in which he can match or exceed the champion, it's grappling. Tenacious as a wrestler and smothering with his top control on the ground. Skilled and careful approach to submissions means he rarely gives up position while looking for a finish. UFC 129: St. Pierre irritated by dismissal of Shields SHIELDS: 'Hunting for submissions' against GSP PICK: St. Pierre. Shields needs to put the champion on his back, but St. Pierre's footwork and outstanding counterwrestling will ensure that he won't. Even a successful clinch won't necessarily tilt the field in Shields' favor. The only expert grappler that Shields faced in the last three years, Jason \\"Mayhem\\" Miller, went three for five on takedowns against him, passed his guard three times and had a tight rear-naked choke on him as time expired in the third round. If Miller can do it, St. Pierre -- who exceeded Miller on the ground when they fought years ago and has since improved as a grappler -- should feel confident about his ability to keep up with Shields on the mat. Featherweight title: Jose Aldo (18-1) vs. Mark \\"The Machine\\" Hominick (20-8) STORY LINE: With the home crowd behind him, Hominick vows to beat the champion at his own game, which means outstriking one of the 145-pound division's premier knockout artists. How will Aldo look after a seven-month injury layoff? CASE FOR ALDO: Throws quick, powerful strikes with all his limbs. Good counterstriker. Proven finisher. Acquits himself well on the ground, with the ability to stay out of trouble even against highly skilled grapplers. CASE FOR HOMINICK: Has better technique as a kickboxer than any of Aldo's previous opponents. Only losses his last 22 fights have been to grappling specialists, rather than strikers such as Aldo. Can catch opponents off guard with submissions from his back. PICK: Aldo. Hominick is right when he says Aldo has never faced a striker like him, but new experiences go both ways; the challenger hasn't faced anyone with Aldo's combination of skill and athleticism. The crowd also puts more pressure on Hominick. Aldo already expects to be heavily booed, so he can be content to peck away at his opponent with jabs and low kicks, as he did against Urijah Faber a year ago in Sacramento. But Hominick has to live up to the expectations of his own region, and if he starts to press the action to do so, he will leave himself open to Aldo's dangerous counters. Light-heavyweight: Randy \\"The Natural\\" Couture (19-10) vs. Lyoto \\"The Dragon\\" Machida (16-2) STORY LINE: Mixed martial arts' elder statesman hopes to ride into retirement by winning an extreme clash of styles between his wear-'em-down tactics and Machida's catch-me-if-you-can evasiveness. CASE FOR COUTURE: Once he gets a good grip on opponents, they're usually in for a steady diet of short blows while trapped against the fence. Although he employs the same broad outlines in every fight, he always adds small adjustments and tweaks to exploit opponents' tendencies and force them to fight on his terms, rather than theirs. COUTURE: 'The Natural' leaves huge legacy RETIRING: Couture walks away on his own terms CASE FOR MACHIDA: No one plays the patient, counterattacking game better than Machida, who is among UFC's top four in percentages of significant strikes landed and takedowns stuffed, according to FightMetric. Has powerful punches, tricky kicks and good knees in the clinch. Can trip opponents to the ground the moment they're off balance. Constant circling makes him difficult to pin against the fence, and knows how to stay heavy-hipped to stifle attempts to wrestle him down. PICK: Machida. No matter how well Couture scouts his opponent, it's difficult to plan for someone content to retreat for minutes at a time. Years have passed since Couture faced an opponent in his prime, and no one on his resume could have prepared him to deal with Machida's eccentricities. Unless Machida has truly fallen into a rut, this is his fight to lose. Light-heavyweight: Jason Brilz (18-3-1) over Vladimir \\"The Janitor\\" Matyushenko (25-5). Brilz matches or exceeds his opponent as a wrestler, and seems to be a better athlete at this point. Lightweight: Ben \\"Smooth\\" Henderson (12-2) over Mark Bocek (9-3). Henderson has the wrestling to dictate the terrain, the grappling defense to survive Bocek's dangerous submissions and the endurance to maintain a high pace for three rounds. Welterweight: Nate Diaz (13-6) over Rory MacDonald (10-1). A match-up somewhat reminiscent of last June's MacDonald-Carlos Condit fight, in the sense that Diaz and Condit both hunt aggressively for finishes, sometimes at the expense of their wrestling defense. But MacDonald's fondness for trading punches could play into the hands of Diaz, who shares brother Nick's high-volume style. Welterweight: Jake Ellenberger (23-5) over Sean Pierson (11-4). Although Pierson looked sharp in his UFC debut against Matt Riddle in December, Ellenberger can keep him bottled up with takedowns and ground control. Summary:","completion":"A big fighting event called UFC 129 is happening in Canada, and lots of people are excited about it. Canadian athletes will compete in five of the seven fights planned, including the main event. The most famous fighter, Georges St. Pierre, will face Jake Shields for the welterweight title, while Mark Hominick will fight Jose Aldo for the featherweight title.

Andrei Augostovich Eberhardt was an Admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy of Swedish ancestry. Eberhardt was born in Patras, Greece, where his father was the Russian consul. Eberhardt graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps in 1878. From 1882 to 1884, he served in the Pacific Fleet as a signals officer. In 1886, he became a flag officer and adjutant to Admiral Ivan Shestakov and in 1891 he became a flag officer to Admiral Tyrtov commanding the Russian Pacific Squadron. In 1896 Eberhardt was moved to the Black Sea Fleet, where he was gunnery officer on the battleships Ekaterina II and Chesma. In 1898 he moved to the Far East, where he commanded the Admiral Nakhimov and took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion.

He also commanded the Russian battleship squadron during the Battle of Cape Sarych. However he was cautious to start further offensive actions against Turkish positions in the Bosporus and was replaced by Aleksandr Kolchak in 1916.

But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Bjorn Borg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune and Margaretha Borg. He grew up in nearby Sodertalje. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career. With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind Roger Federer (20), Rafael Nadal (16), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), and Novak Djokovic (12). The French Open--Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials \\"the most difficult double in tennis\\" and \\"a feat considered impossible among today's players.\\" Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and Andre Agassi, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. Ilie Nastase once said about Borg, \\"We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else\\". In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time. In 2008, ESPN.com asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness--with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history. Borg famously never won the US Open, losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments--especially the Australian Open--was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told Sports Illustrated, \\"I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was Borg recognized for?","completion":"Bjorn Borg was recognized for being a very talented tennis player who won many important matches. He was good at defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness in his matches. People thought he played a different kind of tennis because he was so good. Some even said he was bigger than the game of tennis, like a famous person such as Elvis or Liz Taylor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, what we have to do here is to bring all the b's together and numbers together, just like how you would put all your lego blocks together, and all your soft toys together. Let's break it down: First, let's add up 21*b and -8*b together. If you had 21 apples and someone took away 8, you'd have 13 apples. So 21*b - 8*b equals 13*b. Now, you also have -b on the right side which has to be added to our left side. When you have one apple and you found another apple, you end up with 2 apples. So adding -b to our 13*b gives us 14*b. Our equation now looks like this: 14*b = -154. Now, we've got to share these 154 negative apples (let's say bruises) equally among 14 of your friends (it's okay they're just pretend bruises!). Each one will get -154 divided by 14 bruises and that's what b equals. When you do the division, b equals -11.

The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. It lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe-wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small slug-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. Twenty-seven years later, Chris Romero pines over a love lost, supported by his disabled friend J.C. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and falls instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides to join a fraternity. Cynthia's boyfriend, who heads the fraternity, tasks them with stealing a cadaver from the university medical center and depositing it on the steps of a sorority house. Chris and J.C. find a frozen corpse in a secret room, but when it grabs them, they flee. Meanwhile, Detective Ray Cameron, a haunted cop, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in, where he discovers one of the bodies â the boy who discovered the alien experiment in 1959 â is now missing, set free by Chris and J.C. The corpse makes its way back to the sorority house where he picked up his date twenty-seven years ago. There, his head splits open and releases more of the slugs. Called to the scene, Det. Cameron finds the body, interpreting the condition of the head as the result of an axe wound in the face.

This statement suggests that the place met their needs or expectations to the point of making the reviewer feel good. Second, the reviewer describes the doctor as great, further conveying their positive sentiment towards the place. When a person takes the time to comment on an individual staff member positively, it reflects their appreciation for achieving satisfactory results or the high quality of service they received from that staff member. Finally, the strongest indicator of the review's positivity is the explicit recommendation made by the reviewer. When someone states that they would \\"definitely recommend\\" a place, it indicates they believe others would also enjoy a similarly positive experience, and they wish for others to take advantage of the beneficial services or expertise offered by that establishment. Overall, the language used, the reviewer's feelings and experiences, and their willingness to recommend the place, all point towards this being a positive review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. death - This is not an emotion and is irrelevant to the context. B. pleasure - This is an emotion, but it's slightly self-serving and may not be the most appropriate in this context. C. reward - This is more of an outcome than an emotion and doesn't properly represent the feeling one experiences when helping others. D. satisfaction - This is an emotion and is appropriate in the context as it relates to a sense of fulfillment one may experience when helping family members in need. E. sadness - This is an emotion but is dissonant to the context as it contradicts the intended result of helping family members in need.

First, it describes the product as \\"scattershot\\" and points out the omission of many crucial cartoons. This immediately establishes a sense of dissatisfaction with the content offered in the collection. Furthermore, the reviewer questions when the company (Warners) will recognize the value of their product and release it in a manner that is more appropriate for collectors and fans. This negativity is reinforced by the absence of any positive comments or praise for the product, which might have indicated a mixed opinion or some level of satisfaction. Instead, the review focuses solely on the shortcomings and disappointments experienced by the reviewer. Additionally, the use of rhetorical questions (\\"when will Warners realize the value of what they have\\") hints at the reviewer's frustration with the company and its apparent disregard for the preferences of collectors and fans.

In the first sentence, \\"The Sâmbăta River is a tributary of the Piatra Caprei River\\", it is stated that Sâmbăta River flows into Piatra Caprei River. In the second sentence, \\"The River Piatra Caprei is a tributary of the Sâmbăta river\\", it is stated that Piatra Caprei River flows into Sâmbăta River.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are batteries made up of Suggested answer: When the battery is recharged , the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide and lead. Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"The suggested answer provided is incomplete and somewhat misleading. Instead, I would suggest a more comprehensive answer to the question \\"what are batteries made up of.\\" A more accurate and detailed answer is as follows: Batteries are made up of one or more electrochemical cells, which store and convert chemical energy into electrical energy. The main components of a battery cell are: 1. Anode: The anode is the negative electrode of the cell, which discharges electrons to the external circuit during the discharge process. In some common battery types, such as alkaline and zinc-carbon batteries, the anode is made of zinc; in lithium-ion batteries, the anode is generally made of graphite. 2. Cathode: The cathode is the positive electrode of the cell, which accepts electrons from the external circuit during the discharge process. In alkaline and zinc-carbon batteries, the cathode is generally made of manganese dioxide; in lithium-ion batteries, the cathode is commonly made of a lithium compound, such as lithium cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate. 3. Electrolyte: The electrolyte is a medium that allows the flow of ions between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte composition can vary depending on the battery type. In alkaline batteries, the electrolyte is typically a potassium hydroxide solution, while in lithium-ion batteries, the electrolyte is usually a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent. 4. Separator: The separator is an insulating material placed between the anode and the cathode to prevent direct electrical contact between them, which could result in a short circuit. The separator should be permeable to ions but not to electrons, allowing ion flow between the electrodes while maintaining electrical insulation. So, the answer you should validate for the given question would be something along these lines: Batteries are made up of one or more electrochemical cells that include an anode (negative electrode), a cathode (positive electrode), an electrolyte (to allow ion flow), and a separator (to prevent short circuiting). The specific materials used for each component may vary depending on the battery type, such as alkaline, zinc-carbon, or lithium-ion batteries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A pond with tall buildings around it suggests an area with significant urban development. This means the location will be characterized by a higher level of infrastructure, commerce, and a larger population size. Considering these features, let's analyze the provided options to determine the best answer: A. Town: A town is an urban area with a dense population and significant infrastructure. It could potentially have a pond with tall buildings surrounding it. B. Forest: A forest is a natural environment and an unlikely location for tall buildings. However, it is still not impossible to have a pond within a forest, with some developed areas nearby. C. Countryside: Countryside areas are typically characterized by open land, farms, and smaller settlements. However, it is not entirely unlikely for a pond with tall buildings to be located in a well-developed area of the countryside. D. Rural Area: Rural areas are characterized by low population density and minimal development, focusing mostly on agriculture. It is unlikely for tall buildings to be built in rural areas, as there is generally less demand for high-density infrastructure and living spaces. This makes it the most suitable option among the choices provided. E. Park: A park can be situated within an urban or suburban area, where tall buildings may surround it, making it a possible location for a pond with tall buildings around it.

Washing his hands: Alex should start by washing his hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. This is an essential step to prevent the spread of germs and maintain good hygiene. 2. Checking the food's freshness and storage: Alex should verify that the food is not expired and has been stored correctly, particularly if the food is perishable. This may include checking if it was refrigerated properly or stored in an airtight container. 3. Observing the food: Alex needs to visually examine the food and smell it to make sure it still looks and smells fresh.

Question: Given the below context: When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \\"marriage made in heaven ... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful. There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness.\\" Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about...

News article: Join us over on Facebook | Twitter ABOUT 20,000 children are kicked off Facebook every day for lying about their age, the social network site admitted yesterday. Despite efforts to enforce the strict 13 years or older age limit some children still slip through the checks. The networking site's chief privacy adviser Mozelle Thompson told Federal Parliament's cyber-safety committee: \\"There are people who lie. There are people who are under 13 [accessing Facebook]. \\"Facebook removes 20,000 people a day, people who are underage.\\" While the social networking site had mechanisms to detect liars, Mr Thompson said: \\"It's not perfect\\". Seven million Australians access Facebook every day, nine million access it each week and nearly 11 million visit the site each month. Labor MP Graham Perrett suggested to Mr Thompson that teenagers be forced to get parental permission before they joined Facebook. Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar.

Mr Thompson said Facebook would soon hire an Australian, who would be based in Australia, to deal with \\"policy issues\\". In Sydney there are already up to a dozen Facebook employees involved in selling advertising, but Facebook has been under pressure to hire someone to deal with local complaints and issues. Chair of the cyber-safety committee Dana Wortley said: \\"We know there are potential risks that young people face including cyber-bullying, identity theft and privacy issues, illegal content and contact from online predators.\\" ||||| According to a study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, nearly half of all 12-year-olds in the U.S. are using social network sites, despite not meeting the minimum age requirements for sites like Facebook. And such popularity only balloons once the teens grow older: roughly 64% of 13-year-olds are social networking; between the ages of 14 to 17, that figure jumps to 82%, says Pew. But that doesn't mean Facebook isn't trying to stop kids from becoming addicted to the network at such a young age (though indoctrination does have its benefits!). According to a report by the Daily Telegraph today, Facebook is kicking out roughly 20,000 underage users per day. In a meeting with Australia's cyber-safety committee, Facebook's chief privacy adviser Mozelle Thompson agreed that underage users were taking advantage of the site. After all, any user no matter his or her age can register for the site by simply lying when signing up--Facebook has no mechanisms to detect whether a teen is telling the truth or not. \\"It's not perfect,\\" said Thompson. However, Facebook's privacy czar did argue that Facebook is trying to stop these young'ins from continuing to use the site. \\"There are people who lie. There are people who are under 13 [accessing Facebook],\\" Thompson said. \\"Facebook removes 20,000 people a day, people who are underage.\\" Of course, that's a fraction of the nearly 600 million users on Facebook, but underage users have become a growing concern for the network, especially as it faces increased pressure from regulators--whether in Australia or the U.S. Last April, Senators Franken, Bennet, and Schumer penned a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over privacy issues related to collecting the personal data of users. This month, Sen. Franken stepped up pressure on the world's largest network, with support from even more Congressional colleagues. This time the focus was specifically on \\"users between 13 to 17 years of age.\\" \\"Facebook's new privacy policy would endanger the privacy and safety of children as young as 13. Under Facebook's policy, 13 million users under the age of 18 may be allowed to share their personal information just like adult users,\\" Franken argued. \\"These younger users are the most vulnerable to predators on Facebook and the rest of the Internet and it should be impossible for them to inadvertently share their phone numbers and home addresses with anyone.\\" And that's not even taking into consideration the users who are younger than 13. Read More: Most Innovative Companies: Facebook ||||| In January, Facebook made a troubling announcement that it plans to allow third-party developers to request access to the home addresses and phone numbers of users. Despite Facebook's insistence that it will protect its users, I believe this policy will place users at great risk. That's why I wrote a letter with Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to CEO Mark Zuckerberg urging him to stop plans for this new third party access to personal data. Armed with nothing more than a Facebook user's phone number and home address, anyone with an Internet connection and a few dollars can obtain personal information they should never have access to, including a user's date of birth, e-mail address, or estimated income. In fact, by using this information, an identity thief could get almost all of the data he would need to apply for a loan or a credit card in the name of an unsuspecting Facebook user. And even more alarming, Facebook's new privacy policy would endanger the privacy and safety of children as young as 13. Under Facebook's policy, 13 million users under the age of 18 may be allowed to share their personal information just like adult users. These younger users are the most vulnerable to predators on Facebook and the rest of the Internet and it should be impossible for them to inadvertently share their phone numbers and home addresses with anyone. The boom of new technologies over the last several years has made it easier to keep in touch with family and friends, but it has also put an unprecedented amount of personal information into the hands of large companies and unknown third parties. It's important that Facebook protect its users by reversing their plans to permit developers to request and access this private information. It's even more important that Facebook protect the children who use its website by never allowing them to accidentally share their phone numbers and home addresses with people who may want to hurt them. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Facebook has admitted that about 20,000 children are kicked off the platform daily for lying about their age.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Smartphone, poor sight Look around and you will see people busy on their smatrphones . Smartphones do make our lives easier. But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an average ( ) of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the U.K who suffer from short-sightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at the things closer to your face, the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphone in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light goes into your eyes. This can be bad for your eyes and causes a disease called glaucoma .

As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north.

Article: Whenever someone begins to talk to me about how horrible it is to eat meat and suggests that a nice piece of tofu would be just as good, I just smile and show them those nice pointy teeth we all have in the corners of our mouths. They are called canines , and they are there only for the purpose of eating meat. When it comes to satisfying this kind of desire, soy food can never match a well-prepared tri-tip (also know as triangle beef steak ). Just the thought of the beef, burning on the grill with the smell of wood smoke gets the mouth watering and brings back memories of summer barbecues. When the knife cuts through the tri- tip, exposing the red meat bursting with juices, it's more than just cooking. It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can. Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef. It is lower in fat than many other cuts, and the proteins you get from eating meat are more complete than those that come from vegetables, making meat a better choice for building and keeping up your muscle tissue healthy. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, one thing to be aware of with soy products in general is that while they are high in iron, a necessary mineral for the body, they also contain something that blocks the body's absorption of iron. We can cook them in various ways to make them tasty. Anyway, the tri-tip goes a lot better with ice-cold beer than a large piece of bean-curd cheese would, no matter how you cook it. I guess I should say at least e good thing about tofu. If you cook it just right, you can make it taste a little like the tri-tip, but only a little. Question: Compared with tofu, the tri-tip is _ . Options: A: more nutritious but poorer in proteins B: higher in iron and other useful minerals C: more beneficial for muscle development D: harder for eaters to take in its iron The answer is:","completion":"C: more beneficial for muscle development"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Using a medium sized handheld brush is the better option to accomplish the goal of painting a stenciled design on a wall. This is because a handheld brush allows for more precise application of paint, ensuring clean and accurate lines within the stencil. It also affords better control, which reduces paint smudging or bleeding underneath the edges of the stencil. Using a medium sized roller brush (option i) is not the best choice for painting a stenciled design, as rollers are best suited for covering large surface areas quickly and evenly. They may not provide the necessary precision or control for a detailed design, and may cause paint to seep beneath the stencil, resulting in a less defined image."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"?

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person with whom Patton continued discussing Bennett's condition while touring the remainder of the hospital? , can you please find it? Private Paul G. Bennett, 21, of C Battery, U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: \\"Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying.\\" Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, \\"You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Apply bodyglide or Vaseline. Dust on a coating of body powder. Wear moisture-wicking fabrics if working out. Wear bandelettes.","completion":"Title: Protect Your Skin with Bodyglide, Vaseline, Body Powder, and Other Solutions for Chafed Skin Introduction Chaffed skin can be an uncomfortable and painful issue that many people face while engaging in physical activities such as walking, running, or working out. The friction between skin and clothing, or even skin-to-skin contact, can lead to raw, reddened skin that's tender to the touch. To avoid this common problem, consider using the following solutions, including bodyglide, Vaseline, body powder, moisture-wicking fabrics, and bandelettes. In this article, we will discuss each method in more detail and how you can incorporate them into your daily routine to prevent chafed skin. Bodyglide or Vaseline Both bodyglide and Vaseline are excellent options for reducing skin friction. Bodyglide is a non-greasy, petroleum-free lubricant that is commonly used by athletes and is safe to apply on any part of the body that comes into contact with other body parts or clothing (such as thighs, underarms, and nipples). Vaseline, on the other hand, is a petroleum jelly that provides long-lasting protection from moisture and serves as an effective barrier against friction. To apply bodyglide or Vaseline, you should clean and dry the area of your skin where chafing is most likely to occur. Then, apply a generous amount of either product to the area, making sure the skin is completely covered. It's essential to reapply these products frequently (every 2-3 hours, or as needed) if you're engaged in an extended period of physical activity. Body Powder Dusting on a light coating of body powder can help to keep your skin dry and reduce friction caused by sweat and moisture. There are numerous body powders available in the market, including those made with talc, cornstarch, or other natural ingredients. These powders work by absorbing excess moisture, keeping your skin feeling fresh and reducing the chances of chafing. To use body powder, apply a thin layer of the powder to the areas of your skin where you experience chafing. Take care to apply the powder evenly, and gently rub it into your skin to make sure it's properly absorbed. You may need to reapply powder throughout the day, especially if you're sweating heavily or the powder becomes clumped. Moisture-Wicking Fabrics When working out, it's important to choose clothing made from moisture-wicking fabrics to help prevent chafing. These fabrics, such as polyester, nylon, or specialized workout clothes labeled as moisture-wicking, quickly move sweat away from your skin, keeping you dry and comfortable. By keeping your skin dry, moisture-wicking fabrics reduce the risk of friction and irritation caused by damp clothing. To maximize the benefits of moisture-wicking fabrics, avoid wearing cotton clothing during exercise, as cotton tends to hold moisture and can lead to chafing. Additionally, always opt for seamless, form-fitting clothes that reduce the chances of rubbing or irritation. Bandelettes Bandelettes are elastic bands designed to be worn around the thighs to prevent chafing, much like a garter. These thin, flexible bands create a barrier between your skin, preventing skin-to-skin contact and friction. Bandelettes can be worn under skirts, dresses, or even shorts and come in various styles, sizes, and colors, ensuring you find a pair that works best for your needs. To wear bandelettes, measure the circumference of your thigh, then choose a size accordingly. Slide the bandelette onto your thigh, making sure it sits snug and flat against your skin, without being too tight or restrictive. You may need to adjust it throughout the day to maintain its position and effectiveness. Conclusion Chafing may be common, but it's highly preventable with the right techniques and products. By incorporating bodyglide or Vaseline, dusting on a light coating of body powder, wearing moisture-wicking fabrics, and using bandelettes, you can significantly lower your risk of experiencing irritated and chafed skin. Choose the methods that work best for you and embrace a more comfortable and chafe-free experience during your daily activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

GB team-mate Max Whitlock scored a superb 15.600 on his Olympic debut, handing the 19-year-old bronze. Smith, 23, adds silver to the bronze medal he won at Beijing 2008. That medal, achieved at the age of 19, made him the first Briton in a century to win an individual gymnastics medal. There, his score tied with that of Croatia's Filip Ude and Smith came off worse, missing out on silver. Four years later, with Smith the favourite for Olympic gold and the last to compete in the North Greenwich Arena, the same happened again. This time, arch-rival Berki took the spoils. \\"Louis was under huge amounts of pressure and he had to deliver the goods. In fairness to him he increased the difficulty and to get the same score as the Olympic champion is just fantastic. We've come so far in the sport. We are now the strongest team in the world on the pommel horse. I cannot believe it. This is terrific for British gymnastics.\\" \\"It was tough. It's happened twice now, at two Olympic Games, being bumped down,\\" he told BBC Sport. \\"I guess I'm used to it now. But to come second against one of the best pommel-horse workers the world has ever seen? I'm a happy guy.\\" He could not have done more, losing out by a fraction in a battle between two greats of the discipline. When scores are level in gymnastics, the mark awarded for execution - as opposed to difficulty, which is the other half - is counted first to break the tie. Berki had a difficulty score of 6.9 and an execution score of 9.166, to Smith's higher difficulty of 7.0 but lower execution of 9.066. The Hungarian's victory means he has still to lose to Smith in a major final, but Smith's relief at getting through his routine was palpable, having fallen in the same arena at the 2009 World Championships. Smith did not watch Berki's routine, instead opting to continue his warm-up in the depths of the arena. When a rehearsal of his hardest routine did not go to plan, he opted for a slightly safer set of moves and was happy with his decision. \\"I can't sit here with my face screwed up when I've got a silver at an Olympic Games. It's such a journey, not just for me but for every Olympic athlete,\\" said Smith. \\"To perform one of my hardest routines cleanly knowing all my friends and family have come to watch, regardless of what medal it won, was an amazing feeling. \\"I said this final would be a clash of the titans if we both went through our routines, and getting the same score shows how close it was.\\" Whitlock kept his composure remarkably and went through a clean, strong routine in his first Olympic individual final. Not only did it pick up a medal, it hinted at a brighter future in four years' time. \\"I'm so happy with how my first Olympics has gone, I couldn't ask for more,\\" Whitlock said. \\"To come second to Louis Smith, to start with, is really good. He was so close to that gold. He's upped his medal from bronze to silver and he should be really happy with it. He's done well.\\" Kristian Thomas and Beth Tweddle are Britain's remaining gymnastics hopes in the men's vault and women's uneven bars respectively. Both finals take place on Monday. Summary:","completion":"Smith and Berki, two gymnasts, both got a score of 16.066. But Berki got the Olympic gold medal because his performance was a bit better. Max Whitlock, another gymnast, scored 15.600, which got him a bronze medal. Smith got a silver medal this time, which is better than the bronze he got before. They did really great and were happy with their results. Now, Kristian Thomas and Beth Tweddle will compete in other gymnastic events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Paragraph: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","completion":"Bobby will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near his farm."},{"prompt":"Information: - The British Columbia Liberal Party (also referred to as the BC Liberals) is a centre-right provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We've all heard about the power of positive thinking, but a recent study found that people who think they're getting fit actually get more positive benefits from activity, according to a Reuters Health article. The study examined hotel housekeepers over a period of four weeks. Some of the housekeepers were told that their work duties gave them enough activity to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines . Another group of housekeepers were told nothing. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work activity counted as exercise lost weight and body fat, and their blood pressure went down. The results of this study suggest that it's important to understand and believe in the positive benefits of your activity. So here are a few things to think about the next time you exercise: Just thirty minutes of quick walking each day can greatly reduce your risk of a heart attack. Even your housework -- like yard work and house cleaning -- can help you burn calories and increase your fitness levels. Weight bearing activity just a few times a week can build bone density and reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis . Three 10-minute workouts throughout the day are just as good to your health as one long workout. Moderate amounts of exercise have been linked to lower rates of heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Strength training can help make daily activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier. Regular exercise will reduce stress, keep you in a good mood and improve the quality of your sleep.

After chasing a ball into the street, Donny was hit by a car and taken to the hospital. His parents received the difficult news from the doctors, who likely explained the extent of his injuries, and possibly informed them that Donny had slipped into a coma or had experienced a traumatic brain injury. The doctors would have emphasized the importance of providing emotional support to ensure that Donny had the best chance of recovery. Daily visits from Donny's parents served as a comforting presence at his bedside, even though he was unable to respond to their conversation or encouragement. The unwavering dedication of his parents demonstrated their love and commitment to their son's well-being, hoping that their presence might eventually awaken him. One day, Donny's father mentioned Rusty, and the boy moved his arm. Excited by this development, Donny's parents believed that their dog, Rusty, might be able to help bring their son out of his unresponsive state. With permission from the hospital staff, they brought Rusty to visit Donny, and the emotional connection between the boy and his pet seemed to work wonders. Donny opened his eyes and hugged Rusty, an incredible breakthrough on his long journey toward recovery. Following this, Donny's parents continued to bring Rusty to the hospital daily, and soon Donny began to speak and show clear signs of progress. It was truly a testament to the power of love and connection between humans and their pets that Rusty's presence had such a profound impact on Donny's recovery. As he continued to heal, he eventually became well enough to leave the hospital and return home with his family and his beloved dog, Rusty. In conclusion, it was option D) Donny's dog who ultimately played a crucial role in waking Donny up and helping him recover from his accident. The connection between humans and their pets can prove to be immensely strong and bring out incredible healing powers in ways that cannot be fully understood or replicated through conventional medical care alone.

Here are the steps I'll take: 1. Analyze the situation: Ash got fired from her job, which is usually a negative experience for most people. Losing a job can lead to financial instability and potentially cause damage to one's professional reputation. 2. Consider the consequences: Along with financial concerns, Ash may also face a loss of daily routine and social interaction with colleagues. These changes can result in feelings of isolation or loneliness. 3. Identify potential feelings: Based on the situation and consequences, Ash may experience a range of emotions, such as sadness, anger, fear, or anxiety. She might also feel a sense of failure, disappointment, or embarrassment. 4.

But if you had been there around 15,000 years ago, during the last ice age, would it have been the same? For more than 30 years, scientists have been arguing about how rainforests might have reacted to the cold, dry climate of the ice ages, but till now, no one has reached a satisfying answer. Rainforests like the Amazon are important for mopping up CO2 from the atmosphere and helping to solve global warming. Currently the trees in the Amazon take in around 500 million tons of CO2 each year: equal to the total amount of CO2 given off in the UK each year. But how will the Amazon react to the future climate change? If it gets drier, will it survive and continue to draw down CO2? Scientists hope that they will be able to learn in advance how the rainforest will manage in the future by understanding how rainforests reacted to climate change in the past. Unfortunately, collecting information is incredibly difficult. To study the past climate, scientists need to look at fossilized pollen kept in lake mud, Going back to the last ice age means drilling down into lake sediments , which requires specialized equipment and heavy machinery. There are very few roads and paths, or places to land helicopters and aeroplanes. Rivers tend to be the easiest way to enter the forest, but this still leaves vast areas between the rivers completely unsampled . So far, only a handful of cores have been drilled that go back to the last ice age and none of them provide enough information to prove how the Amazon forest reacts to climate change. Answer:","completion":"Question: How do scientists study the Amazon rainforest's reaction to past climate change, and what challenges do they face in collecting information?

Write a summary based on this article: Mississippi authorities are urging drivers to be wary when being pulled over by a police officer after two people were shot and killed by someone police think could be posing as a cop to get motorists to stop. \\"We urge everyone to be cautious while driving, especially at night,\\" the Tate County Sheriff's Office posted on their Facebook page. \\"If someone attempts to pull you over with flashing lights and you feel unsure of stopping, DON'T PULL OVER. Use your cell phone and dial 911 and if it's a real officer then the dispatcher will confirm it for you and if it's not a real officer they will send help to you.\\" \\"Our deputies have been told not to overreact if someone does not immediately pull over,\\" the sheriff's office wrote. \\"Your safety is our primary concern.\\" Two drivers were killed on northern Mississippi highways within days of each other and investigators in multiple counties and federal officials are working to find out who may be behind the killings. One driver, Tom Schlender, 74, from Nebraska, was found in his car on Interstate 55 in Panola County on May 8 about 1:30 a.m. Three days later, Lori Carswell, 48, from Mississippi, was found near her car on Mississippi Highway 713 in nearby Tunica County about 2:15 a.m. Authorities suspect the shooter may be pretending to be a cop because the perpetrator may have been driving a gold unmarked Crown Victoria sedan, which can resemble a police car. Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance said the search for the gold car stems from an incident in Tate County on April 2 when a woman was pulled over during the day by a gold sedan, with flashing lights. The car did not have blue lights, but had alternating headlamps and other lights. The man who approached her car was dressed in pants and an untucked plaid shirt, according to the sheriff. The woman was suspicious and only lowered her window a crack. She told the man her license was in the truck and she was not getting out of the car. When the woman demanded to see his badge and ID, he became agitated and fled. Schlender was driving from Nebraska to Florida to pick up his grandson from college when he was killed. \\"He was a really good man and he didn't deserve what happened, whatever that was,\\" Schlender's daughter Tracy Anderson told ABCNews.com. \\"Our minds go crazy with the possibilities and the theories.\\" \\"What we understand is that based upon the press conferences yesterday, both vehicles were stopped by what [authorities] believe was somebody possibly impersonating a police officer,\\" Schlender's son-in-law Matthew Anderson told ABCNews.com. \\"What transpired then is kind of a mystery.\\" From what the family has been told by authorities, they believe that Schlender was shot through the door of his car and that his car swerved along the road for a bit before crashing into a median. When authorities arrived, the car's engine was still running and Schlender's wallet was missing. Schlender has three daughters, 12 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He worked for Lincoln Electric System for about 40 years before retiring. \\"He was very much a family man. He was always there for us kids. He was a hard worker,\\" a choked up Tracy Anderson said. \\"He's been retired since 2000 and as soon as the grandkids started happening, he was a great grandfather.\\" Schlender was also a caretaker for his wife who suffered a stroke about seven years ago. \\"The emotional rollercoaster has been pretty terrible,\\" she said. \\"I want to see whoever did this get caught and justice for my dad and for this second lady and hopefully no more [killings].\\" The family of Carswell declined to comment and said that police had asked them not to make any statements. Carswell lived in nearby Hernando, Miss., and worked at a casino. The shootings appear to be random and there is no known connection between the victims. Police are analyzing shell casings discovered at both scenes. Authorities have launched a dragnet, saturating the area, looking for clues and a possible suspect. \\"We do not have any witnesses at this point,\\" DeSoto County District Attorney John Champion told the Associated Press. \\"We're asking the community for help.\\" ||||| Officers aggravated \\"fake cop\\" may be abusing public trust Posted: Tuesday, May 15, 2012 7:22 PM EST Updated: Wednesday, May 16, 2012 6:52 AM EST A Biloxi woman was arrested on Sunday on one count of DUI, 2nd offense, according to Gulfport Police Chief Alan Weatherford.

D'Iberville Police Captain Clay Jones said, it's frustrating to know someone may be abusing the public trust since officers work so hard to earn. \\"The trust that we hold so dear to us,\\" said Jones. \\"Really it concerns us so much that we want to let the public know what to do on these traffic stops.\\" When traffic stops are made by unmarked cars, many departments take extra care to help drivers feel more comfortable. \\"We instruct our investigative units, our people that drive unmarked cars, that if they are going to have to stop a vehicle that they call for a marked unit,\\" Jones said. \\"We clearly display our badges. We clearly wear police uniforms and shirts, but we go that extra step to make sure they understand that we're police officers and everyone is going to leave there safely.\\" Harrison County Sheriff Melvin Brisolara said, while some people may feel officers using only marked cars would be safer, unmarked cars also play an important role in law enforcement. \\"We have to be able to use unmarked vehicles to be able to gather the evidence that we need on some of these criminals out there especially in narcotics cases,\\"said Sheriff Brisolara. \\"We can't all be driving around in Crown Victorias with tinted windows and everything else sticking out like a sore thumb.\\" Officers said it's upsetting when someone poses as an officer to commit crimes. It's very aggravating because it's law enforcement's reputation on the line,\\" said Sheriff Brisolara. \\"When you have the bad guy out there abusing it. Yes. It puts a blemish on us that we have to overcome.\\" Officers gave tips for if an unmarked car tries to pull you over or if it's at night in dark secluded area and you cannot tell if the car is marked or not. 1. Turn on your hazard and interior lights to acknowledge that you see the officer. 2. Drive slowly to a well lit area where people are around. 3. You can also call 911 and talk to a dispatcher who will know if the traffic stop is legitimate. Copyright 2012 WLOX.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? wonderful , ghastly","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence \\"wonderful, ghastly\\" contains both positive and negative elements, making it difficult to classify as purely positive or negative. Let's break it down further. Firstly, the word \\"wonderful\\" is unambiguously positive. It is an adjective that generally describes something inspiring delight, pleasure, or admiration, and is often used to praise and compliment. On the other hand, the word \\"ghastly\\" possesses a negative connotation. This adjective typically describes something dreadful, terrible, or shocking. It is often utilized to express disapproval or disgust. Given the contradictory nature of these two words, the overall sentiment of the sentence is mixed. While it is difficult to classify the sentiment as solely positive or negative, it is important to note that people's perceptions of this sentence may vary based on their individual biases, context, or even their personal understanding of the words used. For instance, in some cases, one might interpret the sentence as more positive in nature if they focus primarily on the word \\"wonderful.\\" Similarly, the sentence could be interpreted as more negative if the emphasis is placed on the word \\"ghastly.\\" In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"wonderful, ghastly\\" is mixed due to the presence of both positive and negative elements. Interpretation may vary depending on context and individual perceptions, but without any additional information or context to provide further clarity, it is impossible to definitively classify the sentiment of this sentence as either positive or negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: The new religion of India is of course modernization, and young, upwardly mobile professionals are everywhere. Sentence 2: Modren India consists of young and mobile professionals. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main points in both sentences. Sentence 1: - New religion of India: modernization - Young, upwardly mobile professionals are everywhere Sentence 2: - Modern India consists of young and mobile professionals Step 2: Compare the main points of both sentences to determine if the second sentence can be considered true if the first sentence is true. Comparison: - Both sentences mention modernization in relation to India. - Both sentences mention young and mobile professionals. Step 3: Evaluate the statements' truth based on the comparisons. - While the first sentence implies that there are many young and upwardly mobile professionals within India as a result of modernization, it doesn't directly state that modern India consists entirely of these professionals. - The second sentence states that modern India consists of young and mobile professionals, potentially implying that this group is the entirety of modern India. Conclusion: If the first sentence is true, the second sentence might not necessarily be true. Although both sentences describe the presence of young and mobile professionals in modern India, the first sentence implies that they are a significant part of the change but does not claim that they encompass all of modern India. The second sentence implies that these professionals compose the entirety of modern India, which might not be accurate based on the information provided in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers, lighter or darker? Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is likely that the lighter-coated squirrels would reproduce in smaller numbers compared to the darker-coated squirrels in the cold mid-western city where Mike lives. This is due to the process of natural selection, which tends to favor organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment. In this particular city, there is not much predator-prey interaction, and darker coats are more suitable for the cold environment, providing better adaptation to the ambient temperatures. Because the darker coat provides a survival advantage in this specific environment, these squirrels are more likely to endure the harsh climate and reproduce in greater numbers. On the other hand, lighter-coated squirrels would have a disadvantage as their coat coloration doesn't provide the same kind of protection from the cold. As natural selection plays out over time, the lighter coat trait becomes less common in the population due to the relative survival and reproductive disadvantage. In conclusion, lighter-coated squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers compared to darker-coated squirrels due to the natural selection process, which favors organisms with traits that better adapt them to their environment. In this cold mid-western city, the darker coat offers a significant survival advantage, leading to increased chances of reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Footage released of Guardian editors destroying Snowden hard drives New video footage has been released for the first time of the moment Guardian editors destroyed computers used to store top-secret documents leaked by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Under the watchful gaze of two technicians from the British government spy agency GCHQ, the journalists took angle-grinders and drills to the internal components, rendering them useless and the information on them obliterated. The bizarre episode in the basement of the Guardian's London HQ was the climax of Downing Street's fraught interactions with the Guardian in the wake of Snowden's leak – the biggest in the history of western intelligence. The details are revealed in a new book – The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man – by the Guardian correspondent Luke Harding. The book, published next week, describes how the Guardian took the decision to destroy its own Macbooks after the government explicitly threatened the paper with an injunction. In two tense meetings last June and July the cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, explicitly warned the Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, to return the Snowden documents. Heywood, sent personally by David Cameron, told the editor to stop publishing articles based on leaked material from American's National Security Agency and GCHQ. At one point Heywood said: \\"We can do this nicely or we can go to law\\". He added: \\"A lot of people in government think you should be closed down.\\" Downing Street insiders admit they struggled to come to terms with Snowden's mega-leak, and the fact that the 29-year-old American was able to upload top secret British material while working at an NSA facility in faraway Hawaii. Snowden wasn't even a full-time NSA employee, but a private contractor, one of 850,000 Americans with access to top secret UK information. \\"We just sat up and thought: 'Oh my God!'\\" one Downing Street insider said. Some five weeks after Snowden first leaked classified NSA and GCHQ material, the British government still had no clue of the scale of the security breach. It was working on the assumption that a small amount of material had been lost. A small team of trusted senior reporters examined Snowden's files in a secure fourth-floor room in the Guardian's King's Cross office. The material was kept on four laptops. None had ever been connected to the internet or any other network. There were numerous other security measures, including round-the-clock guards, multiple passwords, and a ban on electronics. The government's response to the leak was initially slow – then increasingly strident. Rusbridger told government officials that destruction of the Snowden files would not stop the flow of intelligence-related stories since the documents existed in several jurisdictions. He explained that Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian US columnist who met Snowden in Hong Kong, had leaked material in Rio de Janeiro. There were further copies in America, he said. Days later Oliver Robbins, the prime minister's deputy national security adviser, renewed the threat of legal action. \\"If you won't return it [the Snowden material] we will have to talk to 'other people' this evening.\\" Asked if Downing Street really intended to close down the Guardian if it did not comply, Robbins confirmed: \\"I'm saying this.\\" He told the deputy editor, Paul Johnson, the government wanted the material in order to conduct \\"forensics\\". This would establish how Snowden had carried out his leak, strengthening the legal case against the Guardian's source. It would also reveal which reporters had examined which files. With the threat of punitive legal action ever present, the only way of protecting the Guardian's team – and of carrying on reporting from another jurisdiction – was for the paper to destroy its own computers. GCHQ officials wanted to inspect the material before destruction, carry out the operation themselves and take the remnants away. The Guardian refused. After the destruction on Saturday 20 July, reporting switched entirely to the US. Despite these tensions, the paper continued to consult with the government before publishing national security stories. There were more than 100 interactions with No 10, the White House and US and UK intelligence agencies. Three Guardian staff members – Johnson, executive director Sheila Fitzsimons and computer expert David Blishen – carried out the demolition of the Guardian's hard drives. It was hot, sweaty work. On the instructions of GCHQ, the trio bought angle-grinders, dremels – a drill with a revolving bit – and masks. The spy agency provided one piece of hi-tech equipment, a \\"degausser\\", which destroys magnetic fields, and erases data. It took three hours to smash up the computers. The journalists then fed the pieces into the degausser. Two GCHQ technical experts – \\"Ian\\" and \\"Chris\\" – recorded the process on their iPhones. Afterwards they headed back to GCHQ's doughnut-shaped HQ in Cheltenham carrying presents for family members, bought on their rare visit to the capital. \\"It was purely a symbolic act,\\" Johnson said. \\"We knew that. GCHQ knew that. And the government knew that,\\" He added: \\"It was the most surreal event I have witnessed in British journalism.\\" The Snowden Files includes fresh details of Snowden's early life, his time in the CIA, and the libertarian ideas and political views which shaped his philosophy and his life-changing decision to spill government secrets. Snowden visited the UK several times during his intelligence career, including when he worked for the CIA at the US embassy in Geneva. On one occasion he visited RAF Croughton, the CIA communications base 30 miles north of Oxford in Northamptonshire. Posting on the technology forum Ars Technica, Snowden said he was struck by the large number of sheep grazing in green fields – a classic English scene. On another occasion he flew to City airport in London. He said he was unimpressed by east London's multiracial neighbourhoods, telling one British user of the forum: \\"It's where all of your Muslims live. I didn't want to get out of the car.\\" The book also reveals that the British security service MI5 was behind the controversial detention of David Miranda, Greenwald's partner, at Heathrow airport last August. Miranda was detained under schedule 7 of the UK's Terrorism Act 2000, despite having no connection to terrorism. He was carrying heavily encrypted Snowden material at the time. MI5 tried to conceal its role in the affair, telling the police at Heathrow in a briefing: \\"Please do not make any reference to espionage activity. It is vital that MIRANDA is not aware of the reason for this ports stop.\\" • Read an exclusive extract from Luke Harding's The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man in Weekend magazine and online on Saturday.

Warriors in ancient Iraq more than 3,000 years ago could have been the first people to suffer from post-traumatic stress, researchers have found. It has long been believed that the first account of PTSD was in 490 BC following the Marathon Wars between the Greeks and the Persians. The understanding was based on Herodotus' account of the Athenian spear carrier Epizelus who began to suffer from mutism after the conflict. But researchers at Anglia Ruskin University have now discovered texts that suggest PTSD could have existed as far back as 1300 BC. They have found evidence that warriors in ancient Iraq during the Assyrian Dynasty were left suffering from the condition after battle. At the time the symptoms were explained as being caused by the spirits of the enemies the victims had killed in battle. But researchers now believe the male population of Assyria actually suffered from PTSD as they had to fight every three years under national service. A new paper says: \\"Ancient soldiers facing the risk of injury and death must have been just as terrified of hardened and sharpened swords, showers of sling-stones or iron-hardened tips of arrows and fire arrows. \\"The risk of death and the witnessing of the death of fellow soldiers appears to have been a major source of psychological trauma. \\"Moreover, the chance of death from injuries, which can nowadays be surgically treated, must have been much greater in those days. \\"All these factors contributed to post-traumatic or other psychiatric stress disorders resulting from the experience on the ancient battlefield.\\" Prof Jamie Hacker Hughes, director of Anglia Ruskin's Veterans and Families Institute, said the texts references conflicts in the same region as the current Gulf Wars. He said: \\"This paper, and the research on which it is based, demonstrates that post traumatic psychological symptoms of battle were evident in ancient Mesopotamia. \\"Well before the Greek and Roman eras, before the time of Abraham and the biblical Kings, David and Solomon, and contemporarily with the time of the Pharaohs. \\"Especially significant is that this evidence comes from the area known as the cradle of civilisation and, of course, the site of much recent conflict including the recent Gulf and Iraq Wars in which many British service personnel were involved.\\" The paper is entitled 'Nothing New Under the Sun: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders in the Ancient World'. It was co-written by Prof Hughes and Dr Walid Abdul-Hamid, a consultant psychiatrist at the North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust. ||||| Image copyright Thinkstock Evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder can be traced back to 1300BC - much earlier than previously thought - say researchers. The team at Anglia Ruskin University analysed translations from ancient Iraq or Mesopotamia. Accounts of soldiers being visited by \\"ghosts they faced in battle\\" fitted with a modern diagnosis of PTSD. The condition was likely to be as old as human civilisation, the researchers concluded. Prof Jamie Hacker Hughes, a former consultant clinical psychologist for the Ministry of Defence, said the first description of PTSD was often accredited to the Greek historian Herodotus. Referring to the warrior Epizelus during the battle of Marathon in 490BC he wrote: \\"He suddenly lost sight of both eyes, though nothing had touched him.\\" His report co-authored with Dr Walid Abdul-Hamid, Queen Mary College London, argues there are references in the Assyrian Dynasty in Mesopotamia between 1300BC and 609BC. Ghosts In that era men spent a year being toughened up by building roads, bridges and other projects, before spending a year at war and then returning to their families for a year before starting the cycle again. Image copyright Grey line Potential triggers for post-traumatic stress disorder Military conflicts Natural disasters Serious road accidents Sexual assaults Muggings How is PTSD diagnosed? Image copyright Grey line Prof Hacker Hughes told the BBC News website: \\"The sorts of symptoms after battle were very clearly what we would call now post-traumatic stress symptoms. \\"They described hearing and seeing ghosts talking to them, who would be the ghosts of people they'd killed in battle - and that's exactly the experience of modern-day soldiers who've been involved in close hand-to-hand combat.\\" A diagnosis and understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder emerged after the Vietnam War. It was dismissed as shell shock in World War One. Prof Hacker Hughes said: \\"As long as there has been civilisation and as long as there has been warfare, there has been post-traumatic symptoms. It's not a 21st Century thing.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Researchers at Anglia Ruskin University have discovered evidence suggesting that warriors in ancient Iraq, specifically during the Assyrian Dynasty around 1300 BC, could have been the first people to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Write an article based on this summary: – Cambodia thought it had a handle on its scarcity of iodine, an element critical for humans (and one not made naturally by the body) to make thyroid hormone. The country had long struggled with the lack of iodine in its soil, which at one point in the late 1990s resulted in goiters in 17% of its population, per UNICEF. The solution: iodizing table salt, a cheap way to boost citizens' iodine intake. But as the New York Times reports, national efforts to iodize table salt started disintegrating in 2010, and in 2011 a major event happened more than 2,600 miles away that had unexpected consequences for the country's iodine deficiency dilemma: the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, which caused once-affordable iodine to spike in price globally and decimate specifically Cambodia's salt industry. The iodizing initiative had already started to erode before 2011, as the government and salt producers let things fall through the cracks. After the tsunami, things worsened: There was already a dearth of iodine due to the 2008 recession, and the natural disaster in Japan, which produces about a third of the world's iodine, exacerbated it. Add cheaper, non-iodized Vietnamese salt in, as well as the fact that iodine was being scooped up by higher-paying parties such as pharmaceutical firms, and iodized salt in Cambodia fell by the wayside. Now suffering the effects: the country's kids, 2,300 of whom, when tested in 2014, showed a 30% drop of iodine levels in urine compared to 2011. Iodine Global Network Director Jonathan Gorstein tells the Times efforts must be taken anew to halt the deficiency and the \\"pattern in which success leads to backsliding.\\" (Iodine deficiency in pregnancy can lower a baby's IQ.)","completion":"Title: Cambodia's Struggle with Iodine Deficiency: A Crisis Reemerging Introduction: Iodine, an essential element required for the human body to function properly, has long been a scarce resource in Cambodia. The government, aware of the negative impact of iodine deficiency on its population, had once implemented measures to alleviate the problem. However, a series of events over the past decade has led to Cambodia's iodine deficiency dilemma coming back in full force, particularly affecting the country's youth. Background: In the 1990s, the Cambodian population faced severe iodine deficiencies, with the country's soil lacking this essential element. According to UNICEF, 17% of the population suffered from goiters as a result of this deficiency. Consequently, Cambodia began iodizing table salt as a cost-effective measure to increase iodine intake among its citizens. The Japanese earthquake and the decline of Cambodia's iodine initiative: In 2010, national efforts to iodize table salt started disintegrating as the government and salt producers let things fall through the cracks. The following year, a major event occurred more than 2,600 miles away with unexpected consequences: the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. This disaster caused a global spike in iodine prices and devastated Cambodia's salt industry in particular. Japan, which accounts for roughly a third of the world's iodine production, was significantly impacted by the natural disaster, exacerbating the iodine shortage that was already in place due to the 2008 recession. Cheaper alternatives, pharmaceutical firms, and consequences for Cambodia: Additionally, the tsunami's aftermath saw an influx of cheaper, non-iodized Vietnamese salt into the market, along with the increased demand for iodine by higher-paying parties like pharmaceutical companies. This combination of factors caused iodized salt in Cambodia to fall by the wayside. Consequently, Cambodian children have experienced a significant decline in their iodine levels, with 2,300 of them showing a 30% drop in iodine levels in their urine between 2011 and 2014. The need for renewed efforts: Jonathan Gorstein, the Iodine Global Network Director, insists that measures must be taken to halt the deficiency and prevent future backsliding caused by initial success. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can negatively affect a baby's IQ and lead to other developmental issues, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining a consistent iodine supply for the population. Conclusion: Cambodia once thought it had the iodine scarcity crisis under control, but the combination of natural disasters, erosion of national initiatives, and global economic factors has led to a reemergence of the issue. It's now more crucial than ever that the government and involved parties take necessary action to ensure a stable iodine supply, protecting future generations from the severe consequences of iodine deficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If 'Carry on.', can we conclude that \\"Continue.\\"? OPT: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","completion":"Option a). Yes Both \\"Carry on,\\" and \\"Continue.\\" are phrases used to convey a similar message, which is to proceed with an action or task that is already in progress. To fully justify this answer, let's examine each phrase: \\"Carry on\\": The phrase \\"carry on\\" is an informal directive, suggesting that someone should continue or persist with the action or task they are currently performing. It is often used when there are external distractions, uncertainties, or difficulties that the person may be experiencing. By telling someone to \\"carry on,\\" you are essentially encouraging them to continue despite any challenges or obstacles they may be facing. \\"Continue\\": This word is a more formal and general directive that simply means to proceed with the action or task at hand. It can be used in various contexts and can apply to both a person who is already in the midst of doing something, as well as someone who is about to begin a new task. \\"Continue\\" encourages the recipient of the message to move forward in their process, regardless of any external factors that may be affecting them. Given that both phrases function to encourage the continuation of an action or task, we can reasonably conclude that \\"Carry on.\\" and \\"Continue.\\" share similar meanings and can be used interchangeably in many contexts. Of course, it is important to note that the tone and formality of these phrases may be more or less appropriate in different settings.

While the possible answers provided give an insight, let's delve deeper into the options and understand why Kendall might want to choose one over another or a combination of these actions. Option I: Borrow clothes from friends Kendall could consider borrowing clothes from friends. This could be particularly useful if they are looking for specific outfits for certain events or activities during the vacation, or if their friends have recently traveled to a similar destination and have appropriate clothing items. Borrowing clothes can be an environmentally friendly and cost-effective option as well. However, since Kendall has already purchased clothes online, they might want to prioritize using their new clothes before seeking additional options from friends. The option of borrowing clothes should be considered complementary to their recently purchased wardrobe, especially when there are gaps that need to be filled in their vacation attire. Option II: Try on the new clothes This seems to be the most logical and immediate step for Kendall after receiving the ordered clothes. As online purchases can often lead to discrepancies in fit and style, trying on the new clothes will allow Kendall to determine if the items fit well and if they are satisfied with their choices. It also gives them an opportunity to identify if any of the purchased items need returning or exchanging for a different size or design. By trying on the new clothes, Kendall can finalize their vacation wardrobe and ensure they will be comfortable and stylish throughout their trip. Option III: Wear old clothing In combination with trying on the new clothes, Kendall could assess their current wardrobe to decide if any old clothing items could be included during the vacation. Just because they have purchased new clothes doesn't mean that their old favorites can't make an appearance. Mixing old wardrobe staples with new clothing can create fresh and unique outfits while also making the most of existing pieces. Wearing old clothing that is still in good condition is a sustainable option and also beneficial in case of accidents or unexpected situations during the vacation. In conclusion, Kendall's next steps should involve trying on the newly purchased clothes to ensure they fit well and meet their expectations, considering borrowing clothes from friends if there are specific wardrobe gaps, and evaluating the usefulness of their current wardrobe to create the perfect vacation outfits. This comprehensive approach will allow Kendall to maximize their fashion choices while being environmentally friendly and making the most of their new and existing clothing items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Romanian:","completion":"Un număr tot mai mare de companii își relochează sediile, profitând de costurile reduse ale forței de muncă în diferite țări, în special China și India, adesea în detrimentul țărilor care respectă drepturile lucrătorilor. În ultimii ani, am asistat la o tendință globală în care corporațiile aleg să își mute operațiunile în țări cu costuri mai mici pentru forța de muncă, în încercarea de a-și crește profiturile. Acest fenomen face parte dintr-o strategie numită \\"offshoring\\" și a devenit un subiect important de discuție în domeniul politicii economice și sociale. Astfel de decizii aduc beneficii financiare evidente companiilor prin economii semnificative generate de diferența salarială dintre țările dezvoltate și cele în curs de dezvoltare. Cu toate acestea, această practică poate fi dăunătoare pentru țările care mențin un nivel ridicat de respectare a legislației și a drepturilor lucrătorilor, cum ar fi condiții de muncă decente, salarii competitive și protecție socială adecvată. Unul dintre aspectele negative ale relocației companiilor este că, în timp ce se obțin economii de costuri într-o țară, o altă țară poate suferi ca urmare a pierderii locurilor de muncă și a scăderii investițiilor. Acest lucru poate duce la răspândirea inegalității și a sărăciei, precum și la presiuni suplimentare asupra sistemelor de protecție socială ale țărilor afectate. În plus, migrația corporațiilor către țări cu reglementări mai laxiste în materie de drepturi ale muncii, cum ar fi China și India, poate contribui la perpetuarea unor condiții de muncă nesigure și a exploatării muncitorilor.

Answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose composition implies \\"sadistic torture and occult sexual sorcery\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret illustrates a scene from book III of The Faerie Queene, a 16th-century allegorical epic poem by Edmund Spenser, in which Busirane, an evil sorcerer, abducts the beautiful Amoret (representing married virtue), and tortures her to the point of death. The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to \\"the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in\\", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence.

Title: The Peacemaker Movie plot: The movie begins in an Eastern Orthodox church in Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina, when an unidentified man (later revealed to be a Bosnian diplomat to the UN) is murdered in an alley after receiving a page to meet someone outside.The scene then immediately shifts to a missile base in Chelyabinsk, Russia, where SS-18 ICBM's are being decommissioned. Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity. The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US government.Even though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) is not convinced: SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately. She believes that terrorists are behind the incident. Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her. He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe (Clooney), and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board. A call to Devoe's long time friend and Russian counterpart, Dmitri Vertekoff (Armin Mueller-Stahl), adds credence to his hypothesis.Kelly and Devoe try to track down the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to care for pygmy goats Determine how much shelter you need. To make this determination, consider the weather in your area. If you live in a mostly temperate climate, your goats may not need as substantial a shelter as other places. Possible answers: I. If, for example, a goat requires room to run around in, an enclosed area with ample shade is ideal. For a non-temperate climate, the goat may consume the shelter.; II. Small or large groups might do best in bigger, more humid areas. Larger groups are the best for during the summer months, as the heat and humidity can make it hard to get the goat to stay warm.; III. At bare minimum, you should provide a 3-sided structure that offers shelter from the sun and wind. However, if you're in an area that has severe winters, you'll need a full-on barn to protect your animals, though it can be a small one.; IV.

Explanation: The correct answer, III, focuses on the types of shelters needed for pygmy goats depending on the weather conditions, which relates to the previous sentences about considering the weather when providing shelter. I is incorrect because it talks about providing an enclosed area for goats to run around in, which is not directly related to shelter requirements based on the weather.

Brolin, 45, whose latest film is “Gangster Squad,” and Lane, 48, star of “Cinema Verite” and “Under the Tuscan Sun,” married in 2004. They have no children together. This will be the second divorce for both. Lane was previously married to “Tarzan” actor Christopher Lambert from 1988 to 1994. Brolin’s first marriage was to actress Alice Adair, with whom he has two children, Trevor, 24, and Eden, 18. Brolin started off 2013 in handcuffs, with a misdemeanor public intoxication charge on New Year’s Day.

He studied at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School now part of King's College London, but never had a regular medical practice. His training was aided by a small legacy and also income earned from editing works in the Mermaid Series of lesser known Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. He joined The Fellowship of the New Life in 1883, meeting other social reformers Eleanor Marx, Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw. The 1897 English translation of Ellis's book Sexual Inversion, co-authored with John Addington Symonds and originally published in German in 1896, was the first English medical textbook on homosexuality. It describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, as he did not characterise it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age taboos as well as gender taboos. In 1897 a bookseller was prosecuted for stocking Ellis's book. Although the term homosexual is attributed to Ellis, he wrote in 1897, \\"'Homosexual' is a barbarously hybrid word, and I claim no responsibility for it.\\" Ellis may have developed psychological concepts of autoerotism and narcissism, both of which were later developed further by Sigmund Freud. Ellis's influence may have reached Radclyffe Hall, who would have been about 17 years old at the time Sexual Inversion was published.

Plus, because of her small build and stature she was able to lay in a way that she was not stuck by the train or hit by another object from the train. She is very, very fortunate to not have been injured,\\" said Captain Lorenza Dorsey. Horne was arrested by the Auburn police department and charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct. She has been booked at the Lee County Detention Facility. Investigators are still trying to determine how Horne wandered onto the tracks and apparently went to sleep or passed out.

When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members (Ultraman, Superwoman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick and Owlman) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic Justice League by activating a dimensional travel device. Luthor locates a police station but is mistaken for the evil Luthor. The Justice League is summoned and Superman's x-ray vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at Stryker's Island. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the Watchtower, where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth. Arriving at the parallel Justice League's base, the heroes attack Syndicate targets. After a successful series of raids in which they capture Ultraman, the League confront United States President Slade Wilson, who releases Ultraman and explains that acceding to the Syndicate's demands saves millions of lives.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Perhaps the most common facial piercing aside from the ears is the nostril. It's a stylish and increasingly well-accepted facial piercing in most communities, amenable for both studs and rings. Pros: Nostril piercings are much more common than they used to be, making them a good foray into a facial piercing. They're easy to care for and relatively quick to heal. Cons: It's mostly impossible to hide a nostril piercing, and you won't be able to take it out for several months while it heals. Corkscrew-style studs are also somewhat difficult to remove. . The septum is the center wall that separates your nostrils, just under the cartilage. The septum is an increasingly popular choice for a variety of reasons. Pros: Septum piercings are very versatile and easy to hide. Rings can be twisted up into the nostrils to make them practically invisible. Cons: Septum piercings look really stylish with the right jewelry, but can look a lot like boogers with the wrong choices. It's also sometimes a painful piercing, depending on the make-up and size of your septum. Typically, the lip is pierced just below the lip-line of the bottom lip, in the middle, to the left or right side, or some combination. The top lip is also sometimes pierced, which is called a \\"Madonna\\" to one side and a \\"Monroe\\" to the other. Whether solo or combination, lip piercings are both hip and very common. Pros: There are lots of combinations and variations of lip piercings, which means you can start with one and evolve your piercings as you grow. If you want to end up with snakebites, or fangs, you can try out a single piercing and see how it works for you, then go back for more. Cons: Any lip piercing comes with some measure of dental risk, including chipped teeth and enamel wear. Like any facial piercing, lip piercings need to be performed by safe and experienced piercers. Eyebrow piercing used to be completed to show courage and virility. It's a punky and stylish selection. Pros: Eyebrow piercings are powerful and commanding in their presence. Both bars and rings look cool on the eyebrow. Cons: These are possibly the most difficult piercings to hide, and can't usually be hidden without removal or using a bandage. They're also somewhat less popular than they once were. Tongue piercings are a more advanced type of facial piercing that some people choose to work up to when they're ready. It's not usually a first piercing, but tongue piercings are popular for a variety of reasons. Pros: For some people, tongue piercings offer both style and sexual advantages. They're also easy to conceal. Cons: Tongue piercings are one of the more dangerous and painful facial piercings you can get. There is some risk of nerve damage and vascular damage, if piercings aren't done by a professional. They also bring some danger of dental problems.","completion":"The article discusses various types of facial piercings, including nostril, septum, lip, eyebrow, and tongue piercings, highlighting their pros and cons in terms of style, popularity, ease of hiding, and potential health risks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - A priest or priestess (feminine) (from Greek \\"presbýteros\\" through Latin \\"presbyter\\", \\"elder\\", or from Old High German \\"priast\\", \\"prest\\", from Vulgar Latin \\"provost\\" \\"one put over others\\", from Latin \\"praepositus\\" \\"person placed in charge\\"), is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities.

Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name. - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849 February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s.

During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819 23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist.

It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general.

Throughout the quest, Om experiences flashbacks of his time with Shanti, revealing their deep-rooted connection and the significance of their bond. This connection intensifies Om's determination to save Shanti and drives him to confront his own internal struggles and fears. As they finally reach Karzok's fortress, Om and his allies face their most fearsome adversaries yet, pushing each of them to the brink of their own capabilities. The ensuing battles showcase epic clashes of magic, wit, and valor as the group desperately tries to penetrate the fortress. Inside the fortress, Shanti is held captive within a magical chamber designed to drain her powers. Despite her impaired strength, she manages to leave cryptic messages for Om and his allies, guiding them through the labyrinthine fortress. Her knowledge of ancient texts and arcane lore plays a crucial role in their success towards infiltrating the inner sanctum. In the climactic battle, Om confronts Karzok and unveils the full potential of The Astra, overwhelming the vile sorcerer's dark powers. However, Karzok cunningly exploits Om's emotional attachment to Shanti, forcing Om to make a difficult choice between saving his dear friend or securing the future of Bhuvana. With help from his companions, Om ultimately defeats Karzok, rescues Shanti, and restores balance to the realms. The Astra's power is used to heal the destruction caused by Karzok's dark magic, and peace is restored. As Om and his friends return triumphant, the Guardian Council commends them for their bravery and resourcefulness, securing their place as protectors of Bhuvana. The Chronicles of Om: Shanti's Deliverance is a tale not only of action-packed adventure and fantastical elements but also of the power of friendship, the resilience of the human spirit, and our inherent duty to protect and preserve the balance between good and evil in an ever-shifting world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what did ronald reagan do as president I found the following answer on Google: Some of his most notable films include Knute Rockne, All American (1940), Kings Row (1942), and Bedtime for Bonzo (1951). Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google pertains to Ronald Reagan's acting career, rather than his accomplishments as president. Here's a detailed answer about what he did as President of the United States: Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States, serving from 1981 to 1989. He was a Republican and widely regarded as a conservative icon. Some of the most significant accomplishments of his presidency include: 1. Tax reforms: In 1981, Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act, which aimed to stimulate economic growth by cutting taxes. This legislation reduced the marginal income tax rates, with the top rate falling from 70% to 50%. Additionally, in 1986, he enacted the Tax Reform Act that further reduced the top income tax rate to 28%, eliminated various deductions, and attempted to simplify the tax code. 2. Deregulation: Reagan focused on deregulating various industries such as airlines, telecommunications, and banking, with the aim of promoting competition and enhancing efficiency. 3. Defense buildup: During his administration, defense spending was significantly increased to counter the perceived threat from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This included the controversial Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a missile defense system intended to protect the United States from potential nuclear attack. 4. The 'Reagan Doctrine': Reagan supported anti-communist resistance movements around the world, such as the Contras in Nicaragua, to counter the spread of communism. 5. Engagement with the Soviet Union: In the latter part of his presidency, Reagan pursued a more diplomatic stance towards the Soviet Union, initiating talks on arms control and reductions. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on several occasions, and together they signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 1987, marking a significant step in easing Cold War tensions. 6. The War on Drugs: Reagan and his administration expanded efforts to combat illicit drug use and trafficking, increasing spending on drug enforcement and launching public campaigns against drug abuse. However, this approach has been criticized for contributing to mass incarceration and disproportionately affecting minority communities. 7. Social issues: Reagan's administration took conservative stances on social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and affirmative action. He appointed conservative judges to federal courts, including Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. 8. Economic policies: Reagan's economic policies, often known as \\"Reaganomics,\\" focused on reducing the size and role of government, cutting taxes, and implementing deregulation. These policies contributed to a period of economic growth during the 1980s, however, they are also criticized for widening income inequality and increasing the national debt. These are just some of the key aspects of President Ronald Reagan's time in office. He was a transformative figure in American politics, and his administration's policies continue to be debated and discussed today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

An episode featuring her appearance was aired on March 8. For the performance of \\"Devil Pray\\", Madonna wore \\"an extravagant black robe and various rosaries.\\" A writer for Yahoo! noticed that both performances were warmly received by the audience, while Lionel Nicaise appreciated that Madonna put more emphasis on the melodies and her vocals during the performance, rather than costumes and stage props. Bianca Grace of Idolator noted that the performance \\"will have you repenting your weekend sins, as the singer emotionally sings the tune.\\" \\"Devil Pray\\" was performed on Madonna's 2015–16 Rebel Heart Tour. Following the Last Supper-themed mashup performance of \\"Holy Water\\" and \\"Vogue\\", Madonna climbed down to the center stage to perform \\"Devil Pray\\"; during the performance she straddled one of her male dancers, who was dressed as a priest, and engaged in a dance-off with other dancers. Jordan Zivitz from the Montreal Gazette said that she found the performance to be \\"challenging\\". Previous to this the song was also used for promotional videos related to the tour's rehearsals and dancer interviews.

Please answer the following question: Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. Which fruit had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation, apples or ginger? Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","completion":"In this case, ginger is likely to have a shorter shelf life due to bad preservation compared to apples. The reason for this is that Joey, who candied ginger, experienced humidity issues in the room, and since sugar attracts moisture, it would have caused the ginger to become susceptible to spoilage from yeasts and other microorganisms present in the environment. On the other hand, Dan candied apples along with other fruits and didn't face any humidity issues. As a result, the sugaring process would have effectively dehydrated the apples and preserved them for a longer time by creating an environment that is hostile to microbial life. In summary, given the situation, ginger is more likely to have a shorter shelf life than apples due to the unfavorable preservation conditions, which were caused by humidity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Three decades after Back To The Future hit the big screen, a legal battle is brewing over the futuristic muscle car-turned-time machine immortalized by the cult classic starring Michael J. Fox. Maverick automaker John DeLorean's eponymous creation co-starred in the 1985 movie as it transported Marty McFly back to the 1950s to engineer his parents' meeting — and, in a 1989 sequel, to a 2015 world that featured flying skateboards, automated dog-walkers and self-drying jackets. Now, DeLorean's widow, Sally, claims in a federal lawsuit that Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company has been illegally using the DeLorean name to peddle hats, pens, notebooks, key chains and other memorabilia, and has illegally licensed the name and images to other companies including Nike, Mattel, Urban Outfitters and Apple. The company has never been formally affiliated with the one John DeLorean started. Scroll down for video. Legal tussle: Texas based company that designs and sells DeLorean-themed products is being sued by John De Lorean's widow for trademark infringement. In this 2010 photo, cast members of the Back to the Future movies appear on the NBC Today show commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise. Maverick: Engineer John Z. DeLorean created the DMC 12, referred to simply as 'the DeLorean' - a futuristic car with gull-wing doors and an unpainted stainless-steel exterior. Immortalized: DeLorean's eponymous creation co-starred in the 1985 Back To The Future movie as it transported Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, back to the 1950s. The Texas company 'has improperly and illegally appropriated for its own use Mr. DeLorean's legacy, including the DeLorean Identity, together with intellectual property,' the lawsuit alleges. The suit claims the company has plans to manufacture an electric version of the car, which it says would be illegal because the car's design belongs to John DeLorean's estate. In addition to seeking to stop the company from continuing to use the trademarks, the suit seeks damages as well as the company's profits derived from their use. Through its attorney, the company has denied all claims and asserted it has the right to the trademarks. The two sides have a settlement conference scheduled for next month. John Z. DeLorean was an automotive innovator who began his career at General Motors and is credited by some with creating America's first 'muscle' car, the Pontiac GTO, in the mid-1960s. He left GM in the early 1970s to start his own company and eventually produced the DMC 12, referred to simply as 'the DeLorean' - a sleek, angular car with gull-wing doors and an unpainted stainless-steel exterior. Part 2: In a 1989 sequel, McFly used the DeLorean to travel to a 2015 world that featured flying skateboards, automated dog-walkers and self-drying jackets. Futuristic: The DeLorean was chosen by the makers of Back To The Future because it would plausibly look like a spacecraft to people in the 1950s flashback scenes. Time machine: Interiors of the DeLorean DMC-12 from Back to the Future II is on display at the North American International Auto Show at Cobo Convention Center in Detroit. January 14, 2014. Only about 9,000 of the cars were produced before DeLorean's company went bust in the early 1980s, but the car's look and cult following helped land it a role in the Back To The Future franchise. According to the Internet Movie Database, the car was chosen because it would plausibly look like a spacecraft to people in the 1950s flashback scenes. DeLorean died in New Jersey in 2005 at age 80 after years of court battles that included a highly publicized drug trial in the 1980s in which he was acquitted of conspiring to sell millions of dollars of cocaine. His former estate in the rolling hills about 40 miles west of New York City was converted into a golf course by developer Donald Trump in 2004. Sally DeLorean lives in New Jersey with her daughter. Attorney R. Scott Thompson, who represents Sally DeLorean, said John DeLorean bought his company's trademarks, images and other intellectual property during the company's bankruptcy proceeding. Hot commodity: Only about 9,000 of the DeLoreans were produced in the decade between mid-70s and 80s. DeLorean's widow, Sally, claims Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company has been illegally using the DeLorean name to sell merchandise, even though the company has never been formally affiliated with the engineer. Signature look: Profile static view of a stainless steel, silver 1981 DeLorean sports car with the gull-wing doors open, parked in front of a commercial building. DeLorean Motor Company says it existed for 10 years prior to John DeLorean's death in 2005 and has registered trademarks. The lawsuit alleges that in 2004 he gave the owners of the Texas company permission to make a small modification to the car's user manual, and they acknowledged that DeLorean owned the intellectual property. 'There is definitely no written agreement' relinquishing the trademarks, Thompson said, adding, 'to the extent that any written agreement exists, it says the opposite.' At that time, the lawsuit contends, the Texas company was a 'small forum' where DeLorean enthusiasts could buy or sell parts or exchange information. The company, disputes this characterization. William Mead, a New Jersey-based attorney representing DeLorean Motor Company, said in an email that the company existed for 10 years prior to John DeLorean's death and has registered trademarks. He said DeLorean was aware of its operations and didn't express opposition. The lawsuit claims the company has plans to manufacture an electric version of the car, which it says would be illegal because the car's design belongs to John DeLorean's estate. Failed venture: DeLorean's company went bust in the early 1980s. This file photo shows the automaker at Press Bankruptcy Conference in February 1982 in London. The Texas company has been assembling and selling DeLorean cars made from original factory parts it acquired in the original bankruptcy proceeding, Mead said. 'Now, years after Mr. DeLorean's death, Sally DeLorean has unfortunately filed a lawsuit as a representative of the Estate of John DeLorean,' Mead said. 'The DeLorean Motor Company denies that the Plaintiff has any right or authority to prevent the DeLorean Motor Company from operating its thirty-year-old business, and has no right to money damages.'

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What happened with the Ninentedo system?\\" Context: \\"The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360. TechRadar proclaimed that \\"Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The context provides substantial information regarding the performance of various gaming consoles during the seventh-generation era. The reference to the Nintendo system, specifically the Nintendo Wii, mentions that it sold the most console units initially. It was comparatively cheaper, which could have influenced the massive sales figures. However, during its later years, the Wii experienced a significant reduction in third-party software support, which would have affected the diversity and availability of games and other types of software for the platform. This lack of support may have led to reduced consumer interest over time. Additionally, the Wii has been referred to as a fad by some critics. This could be interpreted as the console being popular for a certain period due to its novelty, but failing to maintain long-term consumer interest at the same level. This view was further reinforced by the poor performance of the Wii's successor - the Wii U, which had a disappointing debut in 2012. The Wii U did not succeed in capturing the market as effectively as the Wii, further perpetuating the notion of the Nintendo system being a \\"fad.\\" The text does not give specific reasons for the Wii U's poor performance, though factors could include a lack of significant hardware improvements, competition, and a lack of compelling software on launch."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer?","completion":"To find the answer, I will perform a search on the etymology of the English town name suffix 'wich' and its connection to a specific mineral. Step 1: Conduct research on the origin of the 'wich' suffix in English town names and its connection to mining.

In regard to Nantwich and Northwich, these towns were involved in the production of salt. Step 2: Verify the connection between 'wich' suffix and salt mining in towns like Nantwich and Northwich. Both Nantwich and Northwich have a history associated with salt mining. Nantwich's name even reflects it, as 'nant' means 'valley' in Old Welsh, so the town name means 'valley of salt.' Northwich is known for its significant salt deposits, mentioned in the Domesday Book and was the center of the salt industry during the Roman period.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saens's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saens judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui - Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success. Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes ecoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering. Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was inspired to write a song by the growing tension among the Beatles from the following article ? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

As a handsome brown and white pony called Cappuccino trots smartly around the riding school, it’s impossible to tell he was once close to death. Three years ago, though, this shiny pony was one of 110 emaciated horses found starving on a farm in the south-west of England. He was so thin and hungry his body had digested all its muscle. His skeletal frame was, quite literally, just skin and bones. Although frightened by their approach, he bore strangers no grudge. He lapped up the kindness of volunteers at the rescue centre where he was taken, and responded well to months of physiotherapy and treatment for his damaged liver. Saved: Melissa Kite with Bombardier, aged 14, who when rescued was terribly thin and needed surgery because his terminally ill owner had not been able to care for him, but is now a picture of health. Today, as he trots around the school, he is happy to do everything that’s asked of him. All he asks in return is a little bit of loving care. As I watch him being put through his paces, I hope fervently that someone will offer this sweet chap a home. Cappuccino is one of 65 horses being cared for at the World Horse Welfare centre at Glenda Spooner Farm in Somerset. A few weeks ago, Princess Anne visited this inspiring place and adopted a horse. She took one lucky Welsh cob called Annie back to her Gloucestershire estate, Gatcombe Park, where the mare is now enjoying life as a hacking horse for the Princess Royal. Annie was certainly due a bit of luck. She was brought to the charity because her owners were not looking after her properly. Having run out of money to care for her, they rang the horse charity for help. Even then, it wasn’t all plain sailing. Twice, Annie was found new homes; but both times she was returned to the charity when her new owners’ changed circumstances meant they could no longer keep her. As the recession puts families under greater financial pressure, so more and more horses like Annie have been neglected or abandoned. Some 7,000 horses are at risk of serious neglect this winter, according to World Horse Welfare, which is appealing for the public to help. Rescue centres are full to bursting. Glenda Spooner Farm has already taken in 24 per cent more horses this. year than last — and they fear more may arrive as the weather gets. colder and people feel the pinch. Royal approval: A keen rider, Princess Anne is a trustee of the charity and even adopted a Welsh cob called Annie a couple of weeks ago and took her back to her Gloucestershire estate. Yet if they are to take in more rescue cases, they desperately need people to come forward to give ponies like Cappuccino a caring home. Cappuccino was one of six young ponies taken in by the centre after a member of the public reported an owner who had been breeding them on her farm. The situation had got completely out of hand and she had more ponies than she could possibly look after. Claire Phillips, manager of the rescue centre, explains that the reason for neglect is hardly ever straightforward malice. It is more often a case of financial hardship, or owners’ health problems leaving them unable adequately to care for their horses. The centre tries not to pass judgment, because behind every neglected horse there is usually an equally sad human story. Cappuccino was just two years old when he came to Glenda Spooner Farm and soon became a favourite with staff. ‘He was very, very scared,’ recalls Claire. ‘He had nothing holding his skeletal frame together — we had to rebuild him from scratch. But he was the most inquisitive of the group and quickly learned to trust. ‘Horses are so forgiving. They don’t realise that people have inflicted this on them, so as soon as someone is kind to them, they become quite trusting.’ Cappuccino had liver damage, because when horses are left to fend for themselves, they start foraging for anything to eat. If they are unlucky, they end up eating harmful plants like ragwort. Often people who abandon horses in a field think they can survive by eating grass. But in winter, the grass runs out and what does grow has little nutritional value, and then horses will eat anything in a desperate attempt to stay alive. As temperatures plummet, their bodies. burn more and more energy to keep warm. Without hay or other sustenance,. they soon digest all their fat reserves, then start to break down. muscle, too. Transformation: Jessica, left, was one of 26 bedraggled horses found in a field in March with painfully overgrown feet and full of worms and lice and, right, she is now happy, healthy and looking for a new home. When things reach this desperate stage, a horse may become too weak to stand and, as it lies prone in the field, insects and birds will prey on it. Too frail to move, hypothermia and dehydration will set in and its organs will fail. It is a horrifying way to die. But because the cost of putting a horse down humanely can be hundreds of pounds, people in financial difficulties do sometimes leave horses to perish like this. Then, it is up to rescue charities like the World Horse Welfare centre to pick up the pieces.Cappuccino is now nearly five years old and going well as a riding pony. In the right hands, he would be an ideal candidate for a child or teenager in a Pony Club, or simply as a pony to take on a hack through local woods and fields. Cappuccino’s handler takes off his saddle and gives him a post-exercise rub down as a noble-looking chestnut called Bombardier is led out from another stable. Only his slightly uncertain step gives a clue to his past. Bombardier was one of ten horses who fell into a terrible state because their owner was terminally ill. Too proud to ask for help until it was almost too late, the man eventually called the charity. Bombardier, aged 14, was terribly thin, had never been handled (trained or ridden) or had his hooves trimmed. He needed surgery to remove a growth from the side of his foot and treatment for a broken tooth which was sticking into his cheek. Now, however, he is a gleaming picture of health, and getting used to being led around. He still walks a little uncertainly because the wastage of his muscles has affected his balance. By next spring, staff hope that he will have completed his rehabilitation and be ready for a new home. But individual success stories like Bombardier aside, the charity is adamant nothing less than a major change in attitudes to horse ownership is needed. Just as any responsible person thinking of getting a dog would consider going to Battersea Dogs’ Home or a similar rescue charity before buying a puppy, so horse-lovers should consider taking a horse from a rescue centre before perusing the local ‘For Sale’ ads. For until more prospective horse-owners consider adopting an unwanted horse, rather than buying from a breeder or dealer, the problem of horse neglect will not get better. To understand just how bad the problem of over-breeding and abandonment has become, look no further than the case of Pickles. This friendly black and white horse. was one of a group of 40 horses who were found on a plot of land near. Cardiff Airport in January 2012. You may have heard of fly-tipping, but. did you know there is now something called fly-grazing? Horses. bred by irresponsible dealers who then find they are unable to sell. them are being dumped like so many unwanted tyres onto common land. Skin and bones: Many abandoned horse simply starve to death as temperatures plummet, their bodies burn more and more energy to keep warm and without hay or other sustenance, they soon digest all their fat reserves. Near to where I keep my horses in Surrey, I’ve seen live horses dumped on grassy roundabouts, and even on the verges of slip roads leading to the A3. When they were called out to Cardiff Airport, Glenda Spooner Farm only had the capacity to take two of the starving colts found there. One of them was Pickles. Happily, other charities picked up the rest. They believe they know who dumped the horses but cannot prove it. Successfully prosecuting for such behaviour is virtually impossible. The desperate plight of abandoned horses in Britain is a scandal. Some welfare experts believe local authorities will have to consider culls of abandoned horses if the crisis reaches the level it has in Ireland, where animal charities have now reluctantly called for such a move. For now, Cappuccino and Pickles need new homes — as do all the horses the charity takes in, if it is to go on helping other animals who are suffering this winter. Nearly all of those waiting for a home are rideable. None of them have been abandoned through any fault of their own. Take Jessica, a pretty, white, three-year-old with the most loving temperament you could wish for. She was one of 26 bedraggled horses found in a field in March — yet more victims of someone breeding horses for sale in a climate where there is very little demand for them. All the ponies had painfully overgrown feet and were full of worms and lice. Restored to health, Jessica is a delight. She sticks her nose over the door of her stable and plants a sloppy kiss on my face, before nibbling my hand gently. She is so sweet and affectionate I want to take her home right now, but I restrain myself. I have three of my own to care for. I pat Jessica and tell her to hang on in there. I hope she finds the home she so clearly deserves soon.

Q:Information: - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Thyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses. The most common variety is \\"Thymus vulgaris\\". Thyme is of the genus \\"Thymus\\" of the mint family (Lamiaceae), and a relative of the oregano genus \\"Origanum\\". - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

The sixteenth-century \\"Codex Mendoza\\" provides evidence that it was cultivated by the Aztec in pre-Columbian times and economic historians say it may have been as important as maize as a food crop. It was given as an annual tribute by the people to the rulers in 21 of the 38 Aztec provincial states. - Marjoram (\\"Origanum majorana\\", syn. \\"Majorana hortensis\\" Moench, \\"Majorana majorana\\" (L.) H. Karst) is a somewhat cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavors. In some Middle Eastern countries, marjoram is synonymous with oregano, and there the names sweet marjoram and knotted marjoram are used to distinguish it from other plants of the genus \\"Origanum\\".

It has small, fragrant white flowers and large papery leaves that are often hairy on the lower surface. It is sometimes known as the \\"Burmese teak\\". Teak wood has a leather-like smell when it is freshly milled. It is particularly valued for its durability and water resistance, and is used for boat building, exterior construction, veneer, furniture, carving, turnings, and other small wood projects. \\"Tectona grandis\\" is native to south and southeast Asia, mainly India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and Bangladesh but is naturalised and cultivated in many countries in Africa and the Caribbean.

In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as \\"Coleus\\". Others are grown for seed, such as \\"Salvia hispanica\\" (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as \\"Plectranthus edulis\\", \\"Plectranthus esculentus\\", \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", and \\"Stachys affinis\\" (Chinese artichoke). - In general use, herbs are any plants used for food, flavoring, medicine, or fragrances for their savory or aromatic properties.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Polynesia ( from \\"poly\\" \\"many\\" + \\"nsos\\" \\"island\\") is a subregion of Oceania, made up of over 1,000 islands scattered over the central and southern Pacific Ocean.

Summarize: A survey of more than 500 overseas students across 105 institutions showed 52% had a negative perception of the attempts to cut migration numbers. Almost half of North American students in the UK shared this concern. Universities have campaigned to have students counted separately from headline migration figures. Business Secretary Vince Cable recently said that the UK's \\"torrid\\" debate on immigration risked damaging the economically valuable recruitment of overseas students. He warned of the \\"public panic\\" over migrant numbers and how it could adversely affect overseas students. The survey of attitudes of overseas students in the UK, commissioned by Regent's University in London, shows a contrasting picture. While students feel that migration targets have made them feel less welcome, they have a positive account of their experience in the UK. About four in five of the students backed the quality of their courses and teaching and almost nine in 10 would recommend studying in the UK. There is also a distinction between the public drive to reduce migrant numbers and their private experience of people in the UK, with almost nine in 10 saying that they felt welcome. There was more uncertainty about overseas students' relationship with other students and the wider university, with a quarter saying that they did not feel \\"part of the university community\\". The survey found that 40% of overseas students \\"mainly spend time\\" with other students from their country and about one in five admitted feeling \\"isolated\\". Almost a third of overseas students agreed with the suggestion that \\"my university is only interested in the fees I pay\\". However, despite warnings that \\"negative rhetoric\\" about immigration could put off potential students, the application figures for this year show rising rather than falling interest in UK universities. There have been drops from individual countries, but the overall figures from the admissions service Ucas, published last month, show that applications from overseas students are higher than last year. Aldwyn Cooper, vice-chancellor of Regent's University, a private college that gained university status this year, said: \\"These findings show that UK higher education is unmatched in its global reputation. However, there are worrying signs that the government's migration policy risks alienating overseas students in the UK. \\"This is being compounded by the tendency in some institutions for overseas students to be left in de facto ghettos, rarely mixing outside their national groups.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said that international students make a \\"huge contribution\\" to the UK and emphasised that \\"there is no cap on the number of legitimate overseas students. \\"But we need to ensure that the message gets through that they are fully welcome in the UK to study. \\"Our universities are second only to the USA as the favoured destination for international students, and to maintain this strong appeal around the globe the government is developing an industrial strategy to ensure our universities stay ahead in the global race.\\" Summary:","completion":"A survey of over 500 overseas students across 105 institutions revealed that 52% have a negative perception of the UK government's attempts to cut migration numbers.

After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called the Li'l Ark Angel that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her Valet Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part. Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios â such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans. Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won. What is true about Doug Jones? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - He is Republican - He is not a political puppet - He is liberal - not enough information A:","completion":"Doug Jones is a Democrat and can be described as liberal considering his alignment with the Democratic party. While being labeled as a \\"political puppet\\" is subjective and depends on one's point of view, it is important to note that President Donald Trump has claimed Jones would be a political puppet of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. However, there isn't enough information provided to definitively determine whether he is or is not a political puppet. So, based on the given information, the most accurate answer is that Doug Jones is liberal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Adam's daughter informs him she wants a Simdoll, a lifelike, life-sized doll that acts almost human. The parents notice that the elderly family dog is not well, and express concern about it dying and how sad their daughter would be. It can be replaced by Repet, an animal cloning service, but Adam doesn't trust clones. Cloning knowledge is held by the multinational corporation Replacement Technologies. Human cloning is technically possible, but illegal. Adam thinks his daughter should just learn to accept death as a part of life, rather than being cushioned from it.Arriving at his helicopter piloting business, he and his partner Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) learn they are to transport Replacement Technologies CEO Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). Oddly, the CEO's staff requires the pilots to sign several forms, as well as a small blood test and an eye screening, before the flight can be undertaken. Bemused, the pilots submit to the tests. Adam's wife calls with the news that the dog was so ill it had to be put down, and begs him to get a Repet for their daughter.

Ask a question about Houston.","completion":"What is the history and significance of Houston's role in the American space program, and what attractions related to space exploration can be found in the city today? Houston, the largest city in Texas and the fourth largest in the United States, has played a significant role in the American space program. The city's history as a hub for space exploration dates back to the early 1960s when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) chose it as the site for their Manned Spacecraft Center, now known as the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Established in 1961 as a result of President John F. Kennedy's commitment to land humans on the Moon by the end of the decade, the Manned Spacecraft Center became the heart of the American space program. The choice of Houston was strategic, as it was close to Rice University's facilities, provided access to extensive waterways required for transporting large space vehicle components, and was in a region with a mild climate, making year-round operations feasible. From its inception, the center has played a vital role in designing, testing, and managing America's crewed space missions. It served as the primary control center for NASA's Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs. It was from the Mission Control Center in Houston that NASA guided the Apollo 11 astronauts to the Moon and back in 1969, leading to the iconic phrase \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Since then, the phrase \\"Houston, we have a problem\\" has become synonymous with space exploration. Today, the Johnson Space Center continues to play a crucial role in the American space program. It is responsible for managing the International Space Station (ISS) program and developing NASA's Orion spacecraft, designed for deep space exploration. The center is also involved in various research and development projects, particularly in the fields of human health and performance during long-duration spaceflights. Houston's rich connection to the space program is marked by various attractions related to space exploration within the city. The most famous of which is Space Center Houston, the official visitor center of NASA Johnson Space Center. This museum and exhibition complex offers numerous interactive exhibits, tours, and presentations, allowing visitors to learn about America's space program, including its past achievements and future ambitions. Attractions at Space Center Houston include the Astronaut Gallery, the Space Shuttle Program exhibit, the Starship Gallery, and Independence Plaza, where visitors can see a replica of the Space Shuttle mounted atop the historic Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The Lunar and Planetary Institute, located near the Johnson Space Center, conducts advanced research in planetary science and helps disseminate scientific knowledge and data. It frequently hosts public events, including lectures and workshops, where space enthusiasts can learn more about the latest developments in space research. Finally, Rice University and its James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy often invite astronauts, scientists, and space industry leaders to give public talks and participate in panel discussions on space policy. In conclusion, Houston's history and significance in the American space program are deeply rooted in its role as the site of the Johnson Space Center, from the early days of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions, through the Space Shuttle era, and now as a critical player in future deep space exploration. Visitors to Houston can explore the city's rich space heritage through attractions such as Space Center Houston, the Lunar and Planetary Institute, and various events and talks held at nearby universities and institutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Bald eagles are native to North America, and they mainly reside in Alaska, Canada, certain areas of the United States, and northern Mexico.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

However, whether one agrees or disagrees with this idea depends on various factors, such as personal preferences, environmental impact, and cultural and social aspects. In this comprehensive answer, we will explore the reasons why one might hold this opinion, as well as the counterarguments in support of lawns and gardens. Firstly, let's acknowledge the reasons behind the perspective that homeowners should not plant lawns and gardens. One key reason is that maintaining lawns can consume a significant amount of resources. Lawns often require frequent watering, mowing, and fertilizer application, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, this can have negative environmental effects; for example, excessive water usage can contribute to the depletion of local water sources, while chemical fertilizers may filter into the groundwater. It is also worth considering the impact of lawns and gardens on wildlife. Conventional lawns often lack the diversity of plant and animal species found in natural habitats, and they may even reduce the availability of food and shelter for wildlife. Moreover, some people argue that lawns and gardens contribute to the homogenization of residential areas, with seemingly identical green spaces decreasing the uniqueness and character of individual homes. On the other hand, there are numerous reasons supporting the establishment of lawns and gardens in residential yards. One of the most evident benefits is their aesthetic value. Beautifully landscaped yards can provide a welcoming atmosphere, improve curb appeal, and potentially increase the property value. Moreover, gardens can create a tranquil, calming space for relaxation and leisure activities such as barbecuing, sunbathing, or entertaining guests. Furthermore, lawns and gardens can have environmental benefits when they are designed and managed appropriately. For instance, using native plants and adopting water-conserving techniques can reduce resource consumption and create ecosystems that support local wildlife. Research has also demonstrated that lawns and other green spaces can help lower temperatures in urban areas, reduce soil erosion, and even improve air quality by filtering out pollutants. Social dynamics also play a critical role in the prevalence of lawns and gardens. In many neighborhoods, well-maintained yards are seen as an indicator of social status, reflecting a homeowner's commitment to the community's overall appearance. Furthermore, tending to a garden may provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, as well as offer an opportunity to connect with neighbors through a shared interest. In conclusion, the notion that homeowners should not plant lawns and gardens in their yards is a multifaceted issue with various arguments on both sides. While it is crucial to consider the environmental impact and resource consumption associated with traditional lawn care practices, it is also important to recognize the potential benefits that thoughtfully designed and maintained green spaces can offer to homeowners and their communities. Ultimately, the decision to plant a lawn or garden in one's yard depends on personal values, preferences, and circumstances, along with an ongoing commitment to reducing any potential negative effects on the environment and local ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sanctions are not the will of the American people but of a small minority of embittered Cuban Americans in Florida who are being pandered to due to their importance in elections in a swing state . 6. Congressman Charles Rangel argues that the only success of the sanctions policy has been to appease the Republican constituency in Florida .","completion":"Based on the provided pieces of evidence, one can claim that the United States' continued implementation of sanctions on Cuba is driven primarily by political concerns and election-related strategies rather than the genuine will of the American population. The unwavering influence of domestic interest groups and the importance of securing the Cuban-American vote in the swing state of Florida appear to supersede the preferences of the national majority. The first piece of evidence indicates that the persistence of sanctions on Cuba exemplifies election-driven decision-making, with domestic interest groups controlling government foreign policy. This implies that the continuation of these sanctions may not the best strategic option for the United States, but rather, serves the interests of politically influential interest groups. The second piece of evidence, citing Karl Rove's statement, underscores the political significance of Florida in shaping US foreign policy towards Cuba. Since Florida is a swing state, securing Cuban-American votes in the state is often crucial for candidates vying for the presidency. Consequently, catering to the demands of this particular voting bloc— in this case, maintaining Cuban sanctions — becomes an important election strategy. In the third and fourth pieces of evidence, a 2009 CBS poll reveals that 67% of respondents believe the United States should re-establish diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba. These statistics demonstrate that the national opinion either expresses no preference or opposes the existing ban on Cuba, contrary to the ongoing sanctions policies. The fifth piece of evidence further cemented that the continuation of sanctions is driven by the will of a small minority of Cuban-Americans residing in Florida, who hold considerable electoral influence. The policy seems to be tailored to cater to this group's preferences, as they play a crucial role in determining electoral outcomes in the swing state. Lastly, Congressman Charles Rangel's viewpoint serves to reinforce the overarching claim that the only successful aspect of the sanctions policy has been appeasing the Republican constituency in Florida. As a result, the strategic and diplomatic implications of this policy are overshadowed by the importance of securing votes for political gains. In summary, the claim that can be made from the given pieces of evidence is that the United States' ongoing sanctions on Cuba are primarily motivated by election-driven politics and the influence of a politically significant minority rather than reflecting the will of the overall American population. This claim highlights the power dynamics in play within the US political system and the consequences of political decision-making prioritizing electoral gains over broader national interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was written by Mercury with the first guitar solo composed by May. All piano, bass and drum parts, as well as the vocal arrangements, were thought up by Mercury on a daily basis and written down \\"in blocks\\" (using note names instead of sheets) on a phonebook. The other members recorded their respective instruments with no concept of how their tracks would be utilised in the final mix. The famous operatic section was originally intended to be only a short interlude of \\"Galileos\\" that connected the ballad and hard rock portions of the song. The interlude is full of \\"obscure classical characters: Scaramouche, a clown from the commedia dell'arte; astronomer Galileo; Figaro, the principal character in Beaumarchais' The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro...Beelzebub; identified in the Christian New Testament as Satan, Prince of Demons, but in Arabic as \\"Lord of the Flies\\". Also in Arabic the word Bismillah', which is a noun from a phrase in the Qur'an; \\"Bismi-llahi r-rahmani r-rahiim\\", meaning \\"In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful\\". During the recording, the song became affectionately known as \\"Fred's Thing\\" to the band, and the title only emerged during the final sessions. Despite being twice as long as the average single in 1975 and garnering mixed critical reviews initially, the song became immensely popular, topping charts worldwide (where it remained for an unprecedented nine weeks in the UK) and is widely regarded as one of the most significant rock songs in history. After Freddie Mercury's death, the song was rereleased as a double A-side to \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" on 9 December 1991 in the UK and September 5, 1991, in US.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was there a particular method Mercury used to write the song?","completion":"Yes, Freddie Mercury had a particular method to write \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".

Two colleagues gave blood for an emergency. Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected. Which colleague didn't have a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact? Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

Now, after spending an evening there, I am honestly left feeling let down and quite underwhelmed. I am writing this review to share my negative experience and express how disappointing it was for me as well as for my friends who joined me. First, let's begin with the ambiance. The pictures on their website painted a picture of an elegant, trendy, and stylish space that was supposed to offer a unique dining experience. However, upon entering, I was greeted by an outdated décor, dim lighting, and cramped seating. The establishment did not seem to have been updated in years and appeared rather shabby and unkempt. This made me question the credibility of the online reviews and images I had seen, and I couldn't help but feel cheated right from the beginning. Moving on to the service, things did not improve. Despite the restaurant being far from busy during our visit, it took the waiting staff quite a while to acknowledge our presence. It felt as if we were being ignored, and no one seemed to take any initiative to guide us to a table. When we finally did manage to get seated, the waiting staff continued to be inattentive and dismissive. We felt neglected throughout the meal, and despite trying to be patient and understanding, we felt as if our experience was far from what was advertised or expected. As for the food, I’m afraid it fell completely short of the standards we were expecting. The menu did offer a diverse and promising selection of dishes, but when the food arrived, it only failed to impress. The portions were quite small, especially considering the rather high prices, and the presentation was lackluster and uninspired. The ingredients did not taste fresh, and the overuse of salt and spice left our palates feeling overwhelmed and unsatisfied. Additionally, it took an unreasonably long time for the food to arrive, even though there were only a handful of diners at that time. Moreover, the quite extensive drink menu did pique our interest, but sadly, it turned out that they were either out of stock or unable to make certain beverages. This forced us to choose from a limited selection, and even then the drinks were mediocre and not worth the price charged. As we departed, we couldn't help but feel disappointed by the entire experience. This once-promising establishment somehow missed the mark entirely. From its outdated and misleading décor to slow and aloof service, to the below-average food and overpriced drinks, it is very unlikely that I will be returning or recommending this place to anyone in the future. Unfortunately, our expectations, prior excitement, and optimism were met only with an unforgettable evening for all the wrong reasons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

UW spokesman Norm Arkans said there's been speculation that Chen would take an offer to study law at New York University, but \\"we're giving him another option, should he be interested in the West Coast.\\" UW President Michael Young and Provost Ana Mari Cauce, who each signed the letter, wrote: \\"We believe we could provide an excellent academic home for you in our Jackson School of International Studies or our School of Law.\\" The letter lists the UW's history and reputation in China studies, and concludes, \\"We have no doubts that we could provide you with a strong collegial and academic environment where you could be involved in taking, and possibly teaching, classes as well as conducting other scholarship.\\" If Chen were to accept, \\"the whole thing would be very interesting,\\" Arkans said. \\"We have a big Asian law program. He's a self-trained lawyer. There are lots of interesting connections.\\" ||||| A handout photo from the U.S. Embassy Beijing Press office shows blind activist Chen Guangcheng (C) speaking into a phone in Beijing, May 2, 2012. BEIJING Blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng and a family lawyer have accused local officials of detaining two of his relatives and hounding and harassing others in revenge for his recent escape from house arrest and for sparking an international furor. Chen, whose escape last month caused embarrassment for China and led to a diplomatic crisis in U.S.-Sino relations, said a sister-in-law and nephew had both been detained, though the lawyer added that Chen's sister-in-law had since been released. Chen has spoken previously of his fears for reprisals against his family, but his remarks to Reuters on Thursday, corroborated by the lawyer, are the first time he has relayed details of what he says is a crazed campaign of reprisals. \\"Now they're going crazy with reprisals,\\" Chen said in a telephone interview from a Beijing hospital where he is being treated for injuries suffered during his escape. \\"In fact, they've already started taking revenge.\\" Chen's story has overshadowed Sino-U.S. diplomacy since he foiled guards and security cameras around his home in Shandong province, in rural east China, and was taken by supporters to Beijing where he sheltered in the U.S. embassy for six days. Chen is also being treated in hospital for an intestinal ailment left untreated while under house arrest for 19 months. He now plans to study in the United States, where he has been offered fellowships by New York University and the University of Washington, under a deal between Beijing and Washington. Chen said relatives back in Shandong appeared to be bearing the brunt of officials' anger over his audacious escape and the international uproar it sparked. The reprisals were, he said, weighing heavily on his mind though for now he was unlikely to delay his plans to go to the United States. \\"It shouldn't. We'll see,\\" he said. GROWING FEARS Chen, who recently spoke by phone to his elderly mother but otherwise had patchy communications with his relatives, said his biggest worry was the fate of his nephew Chen Kegui. He said police had detained Chen Kegui after the nephew was accused of brandishing a kitchen cleaver at guards who had stormed into the home of the blind dissident's brothers after his bold escape prompted a panicked search by officials. \\"It seems the Yinan public security has already said he's in their hands,\\" said Chen, adding that a sister-in-law had also been detained. It was not completely clear if he was referring to Chen Kegui's mother, who the lawyer said had been detained and released, or another sister-in-law. The dissident has four sisters-in-law. \\"My family is very worried,\\" Chen said. Liu Weiguo, a lawyer representing Chen Kegui, told Reuters that Chen Kegui was being held at a detention centre in Yinan county in Shandong, but he had no idea what charges he faced. Yinan County Detention Centre was unavailable for comment. When asked about Chen Kegui, a woman surnamed Gao at the Yinan public security bureau said she was \\"unclear\\" of the situation. Chen Kegui's mother \\"obtained a guarantee pending a trial\\", similar to bail, after her six days of detention, while his father, Chen Guangfu, was barred from leaving the village and his mobile phone confiscated, the lawyer Liu said. Police told Chen's relatives that they were searching for Chen Kegui's wife, demanding that she sign some paperwork, although Chen said the wife might also be in police detention. \\"His wife shouldn't be under criminal detention, but that doesn't mean she hasn't been detained,\\" said Chen. \\"So now this Chen Kegui case is making me very worried.\\" Chen said it was difficult to keep in touch with family members in Shandong and clarify what was going on because many of their phones were seized by officials. Chen's wife and two young children are with him in Beijing, waiting to join him in his bid to travel to the United States. \\"The family's phones have all been seized,\\" he said. \\"Just like before when they raided my home, seizing stuff without any procedures or warrant.\\" (Reporting by Chris Buckley and Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by Mark Bendeich) |||||Summary:","completion":"The University of Washington has offered a fellowship to Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng in hopes that he may decide to study law on the West Coast.

A 61-year-old homeowner revealed today how oversleeping by 10 minutes saved his life after a Royal Mail lorry smashed into his house. Len Wiles, of Gosport, Hampshire, said he usually goes downstairs at 5.45am and switches on the TV - but he did not get out of bed at the normal time yesterday after having a bad night's sleep. The former aircraft company worker and his wife Anne, 66, had to be rescued from the upper floor of their Â£160,000 home after the 7.5-tonne lorry crashed into the property at 5.47am yesterday. Scroll down for video. Crash: Len and Anne Wiles had to be rescued from the upper floor of their home in Gosport, Hampshire after a 7.5 tonne Royal Mail lorry crashed into their property at around 5.45am yesterday. Destroyed: The driver of the lorry was checked over by paramedics at the scene, but is not thought to have been seriously injured in the impact. Mr and Mrs Wiles were left shocked but uninjured. Accident: It is thought the driver of the Royal Mail lorry lost control of his vehicle and smashed into three parked cars before crashing through a small brick wall (both pictured right) and ploughing into the building. Mr Wiles told the Daily Mirror: 'I usually go down at 5.45am and switch on the TV. But I had a bad night's sleep. If I had gone down like normal, I'd be dead.' A fireman asked the couple if they were 'expecting a parcel' when he arrived to rescue them. It is thought the driver of the Royal Mail lorry lost control of his vehicle and smashed into three parked cars before crashing through a brick wall and ploughing into the building. Describing the moment the firefighter. arrived at the property, Mr Wiles said: 'The fireman poked his head. through the window and said, \\"Were you expecting a parcel?\\".' Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted to the crash on the busy Brockhurst Road at 5.47am yesterday. Mr. and Mrs Wiles, who had recently agreed to sell the property after. moving in when it was built last October, were left shocked but. uninjured. They are now hoping the buyer will not pull out. Risk: The building was so badly damaged that neighboruing homes were temporarily evacuated due to a fear the property could fall down. Len Wiles pictured beside the house, which has now undergone critical reconstruction. A Royal Mail lorry caused serious damage to the outside and inside of the house, meaning a vast reconstruction effort to the Hampshire home. 'I'm hoping our buyer can hang on until the house is repaired - it's a beautiful house,' Mr Wiles said. The driver of the lorry was checked. over by paramedics at the scene, but was not thought to have been. seriously injured in the impact. Mrs Wiles said: 'We were fast asleep. in bed when suddenly we heard a great big explosion and a crash. We. thought there had been an accident outside on the road. 'My. husband jumped out of bed and went out onto our landing. There was a. gaping hole where the stairs were and the front of the lorry was embedded in it.' Neighbour Nicola Dugan, 42, said: 'At about 5.45am I heard a massive bang, it was so loud it was like a bomb had gone off. While the damage is extremely extensive, Len Wiles is glad that he stayed in bed, as it managed to save his life from the lorry which crashed through his front room. The lorry caused a gaping hole where the stairs were, and has meant that the load bearing parts of the house were ripped out. 'I put on my pyjamas and rolled out of bed and saw a giant Royal Mail red lorry inside my next door neighbour's house. 'Our front door has been damaged as well as our gas pipe, because Len's car was pushed into our house,' she added. 'But the main thing is Les and Anne are. fine - it's a miracle. 'He is retired and even said to me he woke up 10. minutes later than he normally did. If he had woken up then, he would. have been in the front room and would have been in trouble.' Mrs. Dugan said she noticed the male Royal Mail delivery driver, who she. thought was in his 50s, appeared 'dazed and shocked' after the crash. Mr Wiles said his life was saved because he had decided to stay in bed for an extra 10 minutes, as on every other weekday he would have been on the ground floor of the building at that time. The Royal Mail driver had a lucky escape as it was passenger side of the lorry that felt the worst of the impact. Worry: Mr and Mrs Wiles, who had recently agreed to sell the property after moving in when it was built last October, were left shocked but uninjured. They are now hoping the buyer will not pull out. '[He] said he had no idea what happened... He was wearing a full uniform including his full high-vis yellow coat, with the Royal Mail logo,' she added. 'I looked out of my window and saw Len upstairs, he was shocked, he looked scared,' Ms Dugan said. 'He shouted that he was okay and even said, \\"We've only just sold the house - what are we going to do?\\".' A. fire service spokesman said: 'The lorry crashed into the property. cutting off the staircase leaving two people trapped upstairs in the. house. 'Firefighters used an aerial ladder platform to rescue the people from the first floor of the house.' Unstable: The house and neighbouring properties were initially evacuated as it was feared the semi-detached property could fall down when the lorry was removed.

Yes; (2). It's impossible to say; (3). No;","completion":"(2). It's impossible to say The context provided about the Brown Spectator, a conservative and libertarian political writing student-run journal at Brown University, does not give specific information about its creators' personal political affiliations or their sentiments towards any particular political group. Although it is stated that the journal deals with conservative and libertarian political writing, it does not suggest any explicit dislike or negative sentiments toward democrats by its creators. It's important to remember that political ideologies, such as conservatism, libertarianism, and liberalism, are broad and varied. In this case, the creators being conservative or libertarian does not automatically imply they do not like democrats. In addition to this, the editorial policy of a publication does not always wholly reflected the personal views of its creators. Universities around the globe host a range of publications that represent a broad spectrum of political ideologies. It's also plausible that the paper publishes writings from these perspectives because it fills a unique niche within the university's wider journalistic landscape. It is common for university publications to aim to diversify the perspectives available to readers, particularly in a learning environment where debate and exploration of ideas is encouraged. Without clear and direct evidence about the creators' views toward democrats from the given context, any conclusion we draw would be mere speculation. Therefore, the best response is that it is impossible to say for sure if the creators of the Brown Spectator do not like democrats based solely on the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, his sudden resignation left the country in shock and his exit from public life was fraught with mystery and intrigue. The film starts in the present day U.S., with Hockstader living a rather reclusive life on a farm in Montana, far away from the public eye. He's approached by ambitious young journalist Allison Glen, who wants to write a tell-all biography about him, including the circumstances behind his abrupt resignation. As the film unfolds, we travel back in time, witnessing Hockstader's life through Allison's research and their poignant conversations. Intertwining the present and the past, we more intimately understand Hockstader's early career, his rise to presidency, and the difficult decisions he had to make - including supporting controversial policies and dealing with international crises. Behind the scenes, we witness the loneliness and huge responsibility that came with his position. Just as Allison thinks she's completed her picture of Hockstader, she uncovers classified information revealing a conspiracy that led to his resignation. As the risk heightens, both Allison and Hockstader must confront powerful enemies from the former President's past, leading to an intense climax. In the end, Hockstader's legacy isn't simply one of a president who resigned under mysterious circumstances. Instead, he exemplifies a guardian of democracy who chose personal sacrifice over compromising his values. The film ends with Hockstader mentoring Allison to become a future leader who can courageously face the challenges that lie ahead in a world filled with disparities and secrets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu, the then capital of Italian Somaliland, served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. The first disembarkation of Italian troops occurred on October 10. The Italian contingent of 20,000 troops was deemed sufficient to accomplish the conquest at the time. Tobruk, Derna and Khoms were easily conquered, but the same was not true for Benghazi. The first true setback for the Italian troops happened on October 23, when poor placement of the troops near Tripoli led them to be almost completely encircled by more mobile Arab cavalry, backed by some Turkish regular units. The attack was portrayed as a simple revolt by the Italian press, but it nearly annihilated much of the small Italian expeditionary corps. The corps was consequently enlarged to 100,000 men who had to face 20,000 Arabs and 8,000 Turks. The war turned into one of position. Even some of the earliest examples of utilisation in modern warfare of armoured cars and air power by the Italian forces had little effect on the initial outcome. However, the war was notable for the first military use of heavier-than-air craft. Capitano Carlo Piazza flew the first military reconnaissance flight on 23 October 1911.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] and the situation: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Answer the following question: Which village made less money by mining sand? Answer:","completion":"The village of Forx made more money by mining sand, as they chose to mine sand from the nearby dunes due to its profitability. On the other hand, Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, which might bring in less money compared to the sand mining industry.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Problem:Amino acids control cell growth via activation of the highly conserved kinase TORC1. Glutamine is a particularly important amino acid in cell growth control and metabolism. However, the role of glutamine in TORC1 activation remains poorly defined. Glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate. We demonstrate that glutamine in combination with leucine activates mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) by enhancing glutaminolysis and α-ketoglutarate production. Inhibition of glutaminolysis prevented GTP loading of RagB and lysosomal translocation and subsequent activation of mTORC1. Constitutively active Rag heterodimer activated mTORC1 in the absence of glutaminolysis. Conversely, enhanced glutaminolysis or a cell-permeable α-ketoglutarate analog stimulated lysosomal translocation and activation of mTORC1. Finally, cell growth and autophagy, two processes controlled by mTORC1, were regulated by glutaminolysis. Thus, mTORC1 senses and is activated by glutamine and leucine via glutaminolysis and α-ketoglutarate production upstream of Rag. This may provide an explanation for glutamine addiction in cancer cells.

That evening, as Man Chor is checking the wards pasted on the foreheads of the chiang-shih, lighting the incense which feeds them, and making sure that the flame which holds them motionless does not burn out, the joke-playing Chou startles Man by jumping out of a casket wearing a walking corpse* costume. While trying to save himself, Man stumbles against the altar, extinguishing the flame. Immediately, the wards start falling from the foreheads of the chiang-shih, and they start hopping around. Fortunately, Master Kow and the priest are able to secure them again, but the priest and his chiang-shih decide to stay elsewhere.The next day, Master Kow and Man meet Mr Yam for coffee. Mr Yam wants to talk to them about digging up and reburying his dead father, because he was told by a fortune-teller that it will bring him good luck. While Mr Yam and the Master discuss the process, Man has become enamoured of Mr Yam's daughter Ting Ting [Choi-fung Li], who has just returned from the city where she has been studying cosmetics. Three days later, everyone gathers at Grandfather Yam's grave for the disinterment. Master Kow tells Yam that the ground is contaminated and that they must bury Grandfather Yam elsewhere.

What is the answer for the question: What financial institute did the man who owned Chartwell suffer heavy losses investing in? from the following article ? In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \\"the most important country house in Europe\\". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \\"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\\".Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to \\"form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement\\". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; \\"Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ...

Studies have shown that people who live in warm, sunny climates are no happier than those in chilly, wet climates, he says. So the British talking about the weather may be making us gloomier than the weather itself. He said: \\"A study was done that measured the happiness levels of people in California compared to the North West. \\"They expected that people in California would be happier because it is more sunny, but they found that levels of happiness were exactly the same. \\"If it is sunny every day you get used to it and the sunshine doesn't make you any happier. \\"Most of the time the weather doesn't affect our well-being at all.

She survives the wreck, but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? Who's alive? What's real? Soul Survivors has the look of a bad been-there, done-that, gore-filled, blood-splattered, body-stacking teen exploitation flick. True, it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes (plentiful, repetitive, and mind-numbing), but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches, unfortunately rather unsuccessfully. It breeds confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes jumbled, messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery (predictable as it is.) Horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count. Credit goes to Carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick; too bad he's created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance, actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling Cassie. It's great the filmmakers try something different, but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment. 4 out of 10 Now, what is this review like?

Stay off your leg and do as little walking as possible. Keep the knee elevated above your heart while lying down. Prop the knee and foot on pillows or on the arm of the couch. Use crutches if it hurts to straighten the leg or to put weight on it. If you need crutches for more than a few days, you should see a medical professional because it may be something serious enough to require more than home care. Apply ice directly on the swollen part of your knee for 10-20 minutes. Do this 3 times a day to reduce the swelling. You can also use a frozen cold pack or a bag of frozen vegetables like peas instead of ice. If you have sustained an injury that results in a swollen knee, avoid placing heat on your knee. This includes hot packs, hot showers, or hot tubs. Wrap your knee in an elastic bandage to apply compression. This will help decrease the swelling. Try an elastic bandage with a fastener that sticks to the bandage so that you don't need clips. You can purchase a compression bandage at a local pharmacy. Be careful not to wrap your knee too tightly. If you notice any numbness, tingling, odd coloring, or increased pain, your bandage is wrapped too tightly. Massage at a very gentle rate may help increase blood flow to your knee. If anything hurts, refrain from massaging the painful area. Try an anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen or ibuprofen - all are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

PUBLISHED:. 10:58 EST, 5 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 11:17 EST, 5 January 2014. On the field Saturday night, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck showed the world his power and leadership. In the locker room after the game, she showed the world his naked hind end. The NFL star, who led his team to a stunning comeback victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, inadvertently appeared in the buff in a locker room picture tweeted by his teammate Pat McAfee. Luck was, well, lucky, that a well-placed cell phone shielded his modesty from full view. Oops: Andrew Luck, top left corner, was caught unawares - and unclothed - in this locker room picture tweeted y a teammate. Rally: Luck, 24, led his team to overcome a 28-point deficit and win. McAfee didn't even realize that Luck was in the frame - he was attempting to show a humorous picture of veteran kicker Adam Vinatieri wearing a collared shirt and sweater - with a towel wrapped around his waist - while he gave an interview. An NBC Sports photographer caught the error. He retweeted the picture with the words, 'Umm oops?' McAfee, the Colts' 26-year-old punter, soon spotted the mistake. 'Oh boy.. Half naked Andrew in the back of that last one.. He looked damn good though,' he tweeted. Later, adding: 'I feel awful for that Luck photobomb.. Really thankful all his parts were covered.. And now I'm hoping the future HOFer (Hall of Famer) forgives the mistake.' Luck's naked shot was likely one of the last things on his mind Saturday night. The second-year NFL quarterback, 24, led the Colts to a 45-44 victory over the Chiefs - after rallying from a 38-10 deficit after halftime. Luck's heroics - including throwing for 443 yards and four touchdowns - will no doubt go down as one of the best performances in NFL playoffs history. Only twice before have teams rebounded from such a deficit in league history. In 1980, the San Francisco 49ers rallied from 28 points behind to beat the New Orleans Saints. In 1992, the Buffalo Bills came back 32 points in the playoffs to beat the Houston Oilers. Luck, a Texas native who graduated from Stanford University with a degree in architectural design after playing football there for four years, was drafted in the first round by the Indianapolis Colts. He will face either Tom Brady and the New England Patriots or his Colts predecessor Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos next week in the first round of the divisional playoffs. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck led his team to a stunning comeback victory against the Kansas City Chiefs, overcoming a 28-point deficit to win 45-44.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: O'Neill was born in a hotel, the Barrett House, at Broadway and 43rd Street, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square). A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. O'Neill was married to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909 to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910-1950). In 1917, O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a successful writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, after their marriage. The years of their marriage--during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona--are described vividly in her 1958 memoir Part of a Long Story. They divorced in 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and the children for the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O'Neill and Carlotta married less than a month after he officially divorced his previous wife. In 1929, O'Neill and Monterey moved to the Loire Valley in central France, where they lived in the Chateau du Plessis in Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher, Indre-et-Loire. During the early 1930s they returned to the United States and lived in Sea Island, Georgia, at a house called Casa Genotta. He moved to Danville, California in 1937 and lived there until 1944. His house there, Tao House, is today the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site. In their first years together, Monterey organized O'Neill's life, enabling him to devote himself to writing. She later became addicted to potassium bromide, and the marriage deteriorated, resulting in a number of separations, although they never divorced. In 1943, O'Neill disowned his daughter Oona for marrying the English actor, director, and producer Charlie Chaplin when she was 18 and Chaplin was 54. He never saw Oona again. He also had distant relationships with his sons. Eugene O'Neill, Jr., a Yale classicist, suffered from alcoholism and committed suicide in 1950 at the age of 40. Shane O'Neill became a heroin addict and moved into the family home in Bermuda, Spithead, with his new wife, where he supported himself by selling off the furnishings. He was disowned by his father before also committing suicide (by jumping out of a window) a number of years later. Oona ultimately inherited Spithead and the connected estate (subsequently known as the Chaplin Estate). In 1950 O'Neill joined The Lambs, the famed theater club. what is known about his family life?","completion":"Eugene O'Neill had a complex family life, which was marked by several marriages, strained relationships with his children, and personal struggles.

His sons also faced difficulties in their lives; Eugene O'Neill, Jr., a Yale classicist, struggled with alcoholism and eventually committed suicide in 1950, while his other son, Shane, battled heroin addiction and was disowned by his father before he too committed suicide. Carlotta Monterey played a significant role in O'Neill's life during their time together. She initially helped to organize his life so that he could focus on his writing. However, their marriage faced difficulties as well, with Monterey becoming addicted to potassium bromide, leading to separations and a deteriorating relationship, although they never divorced.

The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by SBS TV show \\"Nomad\\" and ABC radio station, Triple J. The band were signed by Murmur, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Neon Ballroom is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released in 1999 by record labels Murmur and Epic. - Christopher John Joannou (born 10 November 1979) is an Australian musician, best known as the bassist for the Newcastle-based alternative rock band Silverchair. His real name is Christophoros John Joannou, and he was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, he has a twin sister and an older sister. He has a nephew and two nieces. He was the first of the three band members to cut his long hair short. Joannou was nicknamed 'Lumberjack' by Silverchair fans for his love of trees, and plaid shirts. Chris' bandmate Ben Gillies taught him how to play bass guitar, making him the only Band member who did not initially know how to play an instrument. - Benjamin David \\"Ben\\" Gillies (born 24 October 1979) is an Australian musician, best known as the drummer of Australian rock band Silverchair from 1992 until the band went on hiatus in 2011. In 2003, Gillies formed Tambalane with Wes Carr, initially as a song-writing project, they released a self-titled album in 2005 and toured Australia but subsequently folded. By June 2011, after Silverchair's disbandment, Gillies was in the final stages of about 12 months of working on his solo album and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane. In 2012, he formed Bento, in which he performs lead vocals, and released the band's debut album \\"Diamond Days\\". - Triple J is a government-funded, national Australian radio station intended to appeal to listeners between the ages of 18 and 25 which began broadcasting in January 1975.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"We have so many rational discussions in school about drugs.\\" This is a positive statement about the existence of rational discussions about drugs in schools. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis The premise is stating that there is a lack of rational discussions, while the hypothesis claims that there are many rational discussions present. Step 4: Evaluate the options (a) yes - This choice would mean that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. However, the premise and hypothesis seem to contradict each other, so this option is not suitable. (b) it is not possible to tell - This choice implies that we cannot determine if the premise being true leads to the hypothesis being true. This option is a possibility since there might be other factors influencing the presence or absence of rational drug policies in the streets or public schools. (c) no - This choice suggests that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is not necessarily true. Given that the premise and hypothesis seem to contradict each other, this option seems suitable. Step 5: Determine the conclusion Given the contradictory nature of the premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

And so far from the strip? Also, there's really no parking except valet, and there's always a group of comic book villain doormen waiting out front to shake you down before you get in. Very intimidating entryway, sort of makes you just want to keep driving. Really - can't you just drive over to the Spearmint Rhino, which is closer, and get in easier as well?

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I thought this film would be a lot better then it was. It sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener, and the start of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film came up short. The plot is just to ridiculous. The KGB and Soviet Union in Russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies' how to act like Americans, but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated, so they grab two yanks from the US to spice things up. I don't know, but this seems just to out there. It gets really odd when next to no one in this all Russian town speaks in a Russian accent. Someone screwed up in the casting job. Also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. There is one, two funny spots tops, and they are nothing to sing and dance about. The film in the end will likely put you to sleep. And, as a twisted punch in the face, this film is so pro the US it makes me sick. The movie keeps on saying again and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the Japanese in World War 2. It's films like these that makes everyone think that the US is full of itself.

Brought down by its ineffectual storytelling and poorly rendered CGI effects, the film teeters on the precarious edge between being forgettable and frustratingly bad. The plot centers on a motley crew of adventurers, led by the charming yet ever so slightly insipid Jack, played by Tim Halloway, who must band together to overcome a series of increasingly fantastic and far-fetched obstacles. While this premise could potentially have been engaging, the execution of it is plagued by a glaring lack of originality and seemingly endless clichés, making the entire endeavor feel like a tired rehash of what has come before. In terms of acting, the performers try admirably to infuse their roles with life. However, their efforts are thwarted by the trite dialogue and one-dimensional characters, which leave the audience feeling detached and at times almost disinterested. The notable exception is the villainous Captain Black, portrayed brilliantly by veteran actor Richard Davies. Still, even his alluring performance is not enough to singlehandedly save the film. The special effects in The Journey Ahead further add to its negative sentiment, as its uncanny creatures and unconvincing green-screen backgrounds prevent any sense of immersion. This would potentially be forgivable if the film was a low-budget indie project, but with a price tag of millions, this lack of attention to detail is inexcusable. As for the pacing, the narrative stumbles and falters, with the drawn-out action sequences consuming a disproportionate amount of the running time. Any redeeming aspects related to character development and internal conflict are left woefully underexplored, ultimately leaving the audience struggling to build an emotional connection with the protagonists. In conclusion, The Journey Ahead proves a substantial disappointment when it comes to its potential for success. Hindered by its lackluster storytelling, uninspired characterization, shoddy special effects, and an almost baffling overemphasis on drawn-out action sequences, the film squanders its otherwise remarkable premise and cast. Regrettably, for those in search of adventure and excitement on the big screen, this is a journey not worth embarking upon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Supreme Court, not so much. Americans are proud that they have elected as their president a black man who has brought a tone of racial healing. But, if yesterday's argument was an indication, the high court remains mired in the same old racial battles, as the conservative and liberal blocs, abandoning hope of common ground, slugged it out over the latest racial discrimination case headed toward an inevitable 5 to 4 decision. The liberal justices harangued the lawyer for white firefighters from New Haven, Conn., who claimed they were victims of discrimination when the city threw out the results of a professional test because no black candidates had earned promotions. Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the lawyer that his argument \\"can't be right.\\" Stephen Breyer, raising his eyebrows and shaking his head, informed counsel that his claim was \\"very far-reaching.\\" David Souter angrily accused the lawyer of \\"turning any race-conscious decision into a discrimination decision, and that equation we certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.\\" The conservative justices countered by heaping scorn on the city and the Obama administration, which defended taking race into account. John Roberts accused them of seeking a \\"blank check to discriminate\\" and informed them that it's \\"an odd argument to say that you can violate the Constitution.\\" Samuel Alito mocked their claim that the test was flawed. Antonin Scalia derided the city for throwing out the test \\"for the losers as well as for the winners.\\" \\"I think,\\" observed Gregory Coleman, lawyer for the firefighters, \\"the court is certainly not fully in agreement on these questions.\\" The justices had had a lighthearted argument the day before, discussing the bra and underpants of a 13-year-old girl who was ordered by school authorities to strip as part of a drug search. \\"In my experience, when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years old, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day; we changed for gym, okay?\\" Breyer argued. \\"And in my experience, too, people did sometimes stick things in my underwear.\\" But yesterday the subject turned to race, and the justices were ready to squabble from the moment the chief justice introduced the case by mispronouncing the name of the defendant, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano. \\"Racial classifications are inherently pernicious,\\" argued Coleman, a Texan arguing for the Connecticut firefighters. He managed to toss out the terms \\"destructive racial politics,\\" \\"illegitimate uses of race\\" and \\"racial favoritism\\" before the liberal justices interrupted. John Paul Stevens raised a question about whether it was really a race-based decision. Ginsburg compared the test to one that \\"disproportionately excludes female applicants.\\" Souter said Coleman made \\"no distinction\\" between discrimination and benign race consciousness. Coleman was abrupt. \\"No, I completely disagree with that, Justice Souter,\\" he said, and later, \\"I disagree with that as well.\\" The lawyer knew he had no reason to be solicitous of Souter -- who, like seven other justices, had already made up his mind. In fact, both sides directed their arguments toward only one man, Anthony Kennedy, who will give either the liberals or the conservatives their fifth vote. Kennedy proposed a hypothetical \\"designed to ask you the question whether or not race consciousness is ever permissible.\\" Immediately, the other justices tailored their own arguments to Kennedy's line of thought. \\"What if you've got the basis of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical?\\" inquired Souter. \\"Is that your answer to Justice Kennedy or not?\\" asked Breyer. Ginsburg pressed further about \\"what you just answered to Justice Kennedy.\\" \\"I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice Kennedy,\\" Stevens announced.

Palmer has had a diverse golf-related business career, including owning the Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Orlando, Florida, which is the venue for the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational (renamed from the Bay Hill Invitational in 2007), helping to found The Golf Channel, and negotiating the deal to build the first golf course in the People's Republic of China. This led to the formation of Palmer Course Design in 1972, which was renamed Arnold Palmer Design Company when the company moved to Orlando, Florida, in 2006. Palmer's design partner was Ed Seay. Palmer designed more than 300 golf courses in 37 states, 25 countries, and five continents (all except Africa and Antarctica), including the first modern course built in China, in 1988. In 1971, he purchased Latrobe Country Club (where his father used to be the club professional) and owned it until his death. The licensing, endorsements, spokesman associations and commercial partnerships built by Palmer and McCormack are managed by Arnold Palmer Enterprises. Palmer was also a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects. In 1997, Palmer and fellow golfer Tiger Woods initiated a civil case in an effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. The lawsuit was filed against Bruce Matthews, the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc. and others. Matthews and associated parties counter-claimed that Palmer and associated businesses committed several acts, including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. On March 12, 2014, a Florida jury ruled in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims. The same jury rejected the counterclaims of Palmer and Woods, and awarded Gotta Have It 668,346 in damages.

A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person feeling breathless can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen being brought to the body. Direct effect: When a person is feeling breathless, their breathing rate may increase, causing them to take shallower breaths. This can result in less air reaching the alveoli, where the oxygen exchange occurs. Consequently, there will be less oxygen available to enter the bloodstream and be transported to the body cells. Indirect effect: Breathlessness can also trigger the activation of the body's stress response, leading to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.

A 91-year-old pensioner has been hailed a hero after rescuing her elderly neighbour from his smoke-filled flat. Jessamine Skuse spotted smoke billowing from her neighbour's home and without a thought for her own safety, ran inside and pulled Evan Davis, 97, to safety. Despite her frail frame, Jessamine managed to drag Evan, who had only recently been discharged from hospital, out of his house and onto a mobility scooter before fire officers arrived. Firefighters claim her super strength and quick thinking probably saved Evan's life. Jessamine Skuse, 91, helped save the life of her 97-year-old neighbour Evan Davis, after smoke filled his flat. The flats in Knowle, Bristol where Jessamine pulled from Evan his smoke-filled home and on to a mobility scooter before firefighters arrived. Her swift actions meant the fire brigade could get to the flats in Knowle, Bristol - home to many elderly people - and extinguish a smouldering tea towel before it burst into flames. And the modest pensioner counts her blessings that waking up early allowed her to spot, and smell, the danger. She said: 'I wake up at 6am every day because I worked for 40 years and it's programmed into my body clock. 'That was very fortunate because at about 6.30am, I could smell smoke. 'I went out into the corridor and I could smell it out there too, but I didn't know where it was coming from. 'I came back to my flat to see if I'd left anything on, but I hadn't. Firefighters claim Jessamine's super strength and quick-thinking probably saved Evan's life. Jessamine Skuse, aged 20, whilst serving in the 80th Army Searchlight Regiment (Auxiliary Territorial Service) during WWII in 1942. 'I went back out and could see the smoke coming from under Evan's door. I banged and banged and shouted to him and he said 'just a minute'. 'When he opened the door he was on the floor and the flat was absolutely full of smoke. 'It was such a shock - it was bellowing out.' Evan then went back into his home and sat down in his front room, not realising how dangerous it was. 'I went over and grabbed him by the arm and said 'come on, Evan',' Jessamine explained. 'I put my arm around him and helped him out of the door and he said 'where are we going?' so I said 'it's all right, come with me'. 'I got him out into the corridor and went and got a shop mobility aid for him to sit on, but by the time I did that he was on the floor again. 'I managed to pull him up and sit him down, but he was very heavy, then I got him a glass of water and waited for the fire brigade to arrive. 'It was a good job I was up early because otherwise Evan could have died in all that smoke. 'And if his flat had caught fire it could have spread to all of our flats. A copy of the letter sent to Jessamine when she was awarded the Imperial Service Medal for 40 years civil service. Still active and healthy, every Sunday Jessamine rings one of the bells at St Martin's Church. 'These are private flats with People For Places. We don't have a warden here all the time, so if I'd been up any later there would have been no way of me getting in if he couldn't answer the door. 'I had a bit of coughing from the smoke, but I'm alright now.' Evan was taken to hospital suffering with smoke inhalation and has not yet returned home. Avon Fire and Rescue crews from Brislington and Temple stations used a CO2 extinguisher on what was believed to have been a tea towel Mr Davis had left on a lamp to dry. Miss Skuse, who lives alone, worked for the civil service in The Pithay for 40 years and was proud to receive the Imperial Service Medal (ISM). From 1942 to 1947, she served her country with the 80th Search Light Regiment - a time that taught her to be calm in an emergency. She added: 'Being in the Army definitely taught me a lot. 'I don't think I would still be here today if I hadn't gone into the Army. It teaches you to keep calm in emergencies, keeps you fit and teaches you discipline. 'We used to get up early and do 12-mile route marches.' Miss Skuse doesn't have any children, but dotes over her many nieces and nephews. Still active and healthy, every Sunday she rings one of the bells at St Martin's Church and during the Olympics last summer managed to ring the bell for three-minutes non-stop to mark the event. Relieved she was able to help Mr Davis, her neighbour of 11 years, she added: 'You've got to be alert even though you get older. 'You've still got to care for one another, because a lot of people don't.' Avon Fire and Rescue spokesman James Bladon said: 'There is little doubt the actions of Miss Skuse played a significant part in averting a much more serious incident. 'Just a couple of breaths of smoke in a house fire is enough to kill, so the sooner you can get to a place of fresh air, the better. 'Although we would never advise anyone to enter a property that's on fire, we thank Miss Skuse for the part she played that morning. 'Not everyone is fortunate enough to have such a quick-thinking neighbour, which is why installing smoke alarms on every level of your home and testing them on a regular basis is so important. 'Smoke alarms provide vital early warning of a fire, allowing you and your loved ones time to escape safely.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Why does it say on children 's cough syrup not to drive while using this medication ? What kind of thing would answer this question?","completion":"The warning label on children's cough syrup that advises against driving while using the medication is due to the potential side effects and ingredients present in the syrup that could impair cognitive functioning and physical coordination, thus increasing the risk of accidents while driving. A detailed explanation of the factors that would answer this question entails: 1. Active ingredients: Most cough syrups, including those meant for children, contain active ingredients like dextromethorphan (DM), antihistamines, and decongestants. Dextromethorphan is a common ingredient found in these medications to help suppress coughing. However, it can cause drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, or lack of focus, especially when taken in higher doses or in combination with other drugs. 2. Antihistamines: Antihistamines like diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine may also be included in children's cough syrups as they help with allergies and cold symptoms. These medications have sedative properties, which cause drowsiness and impede cognitive functions like concentration and decision-making. They can also slow down reflexes and reduce motor coordination. 3. Personal sensitivity: Different individuals have varying sensitivity levels to medications, and some people may experience the side effects more intensely than others. Side effects like drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired motor functions may be more pronounced in certain individuals, thus increasing the risk of accidents while driving. Children, being small and with developing bodies, are particularly vulnerable to these effects. 4. Drug interactions: When taking cough syrup along with other medications, there is a possibility of interactions between these substances, leading to increased side effects. For example, combining cough syrup containing DM or antihistamines with other sedating medications like sleeping pills, muscle relaxants, or antianxiety medications can amplify their effects and further impair driving abilities. 5. Alcohol interaction: It is also crucial to mention that taking cough syrup containing dextromethorphan or antihistamines with alcohol could exacerbate the sedative effects of these medications. This combination could intensify drowsiness, dizziness, and lack of coordination, making it highly unsafe to drive. In summary, the warning against driving while using children's cough syrup is due to the potential side effects of the active ingredients, personal sensitivity to these medications, possible drug interactions, and additional risks induced by consuming alcohol alongside the syrup. The effects of these medications could hamper an individual’s cognitive and physical abilities, making it unsafe to drive and increasing the risk of accidents. It is important to exercise caution and adhere to these warnings to ensure personal safety and the safety of others on the road."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When she took up the hobby of crafting jewelry, her friends and family were excited to see what beautiful designs she would come up with. Little did they know just how stunning her creations would truly be. Maria spent countless hours researching different materials, methods, and styles to make her jewelry unique and eye-catching. Beads of various shapes, sizes, and colors adorned her workbench, along with an array of delicate chains and sparkling gemstones. Her commitment to craftsmanship was evident in the way she carefully selected each bead and gemstone, meticulously linking them together in striking and intricate patterns. As Maria's collection of dazzling necklaces, bracelets, and earrings grew, word spread about her talent, and soon people began asking her to create custom pieces for special occasions. Maria was thrilled and honored to see people wearing her creations, the culmination of her hard work and passion. One day, Laura, a distant acquaintance of Maria, approached her with a request for a particularly intricate necklace for an upcoming event.

The result was a stunning statement piece, composed of a delicate chain adorned with shimmering crystals and cascading strands of vibrant gemstones, capturing light in a mesmerizing way.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making dumplings, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather all essential ingredients and equipment: Ingredients: - 2 cups all-purpose flour - 1/2 cup water (for dough) - 1/2 teaspoon salt (for dough) - 2 cups your choice of filling (pork, chicken, shrimp, tofu, mixed vegetables, etc.) - 1/2 cup finely chopped onion or green onion - 1/4 cup finely chopped cabbage - 2 tablespoons soy sauce - 1 tablespoon minced garlic - 1 tablespoon minced ginger - 1 teaspoon sesame oil - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon salt (for filling) Equipment: - Mixing bowl - Rolling pin - Cutting board - Knife - Spoon - Frying pan or steamer (depending on how you choose to cook the dumplings) - Pastry brush - Damp cloth or plastic wrap - Small bowl of water to seal the edges of the dumplings 2. Prepare the dumpling dough: - In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and water. Mix the ingredients until a shaggy dough forms. - Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. You can add a small amount of water or flour if needed to achieve the right consistency. - Once the dough is ready, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 20-30 minutes. This will make it easier to work with later. 3. Prepare the dumpling filling: - In a large mixing bowl, add your choice of filling, onion, cabbage, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, black pepper, and salt. Mix well until all ingredients are combined. You can adjust the seasoning as per your preference. 4. Roll out the dumpling dough: - Divide the dough into small equal-sized portions. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it using your hands. - On a floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll the flattened dough into a circular wrapper, about 3-4 inches in diameter and 1/16-inch thick. - Try to roll the edges thinner than the center, as they'll be overlapping when sealed. Keep the remaining dough covered with a damp cloth while you work to prevent drying out. 5. Assemble the dumplings: - Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each wrapper, being careful not to overfill. - Dip your fingertip in the bowl of water and run it along the outer edge of the wrapper, which will help seal the dumpling. - Fold the wrapper in half and pinch the edges together to seal, making sure there are no air bubbles. You can add pleats or crimps to make the dumplings more visually appealing. Place the finished dumplings on a tray lined with parchment paper, and cover them with a damp cloth to prevent drying. 6. Cook the dumplings: - There are several ways to cook dumplings, such as boiling, frying, or steaming; here are two popular methods: A. Pan-fry the dumplings: - Heat a non-stick frying pan with 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. - Place the dumplings in the pan with pleats facing upwards, not touching each other. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. - Add 1/4 cup of water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid to steam the dumplings. Reduce the heat to low and let them cook for 7-8 minutes or until all the water has evaporated and the dumplings' tops are cooked through. B. Steam the dumplings: - Prepare your steamer by brushing with oil or lining with parchment paper (with a few small holes to let steam through). - Place the dumplings in the steamer, ensuring they don't touch each other or the sides of the steamer. - Steam the dumplings over boiling water for 10-12 minutes or until the dough becomes slightly translucent and the filling is cooked through. 7. Serve the dumplings hot, accompanied by your favorite dipping sauce, such as soy sauce, vinegar, or a combination of both with some chili oil, sesame oil, and minced garlic. Now you have successfully accomplished the goal of making dumplings! Enjoy these tasty treats with friends and family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Life expectancy at birth has increased from 39.1 in 1960 to 59.5 years in 2008, maternal and child mortality rates have dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure has been expanded. Due to Eritrea's relative isolation, information and resources are extremely limited and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) found in 2008 average life expectancy to be slightly less than 63 years. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995–2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). The National Malaria Protection Unit of the Ministry of Health has registered tremendous improvements in reducing malarial mortality by as much as 85% and the number of cases by 92% between 1998 and 2006.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollyhood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much! What is the main topic of the reading? A) famous stars in Bollywood B) how Hollywood movies are made C) the differences between two movie industries D) the history of movie-making in India Answer:","completion":"C) the differences between two movie industries"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... According to the above context, answer the following question. When does the unique idea come to a creative person? Options: [1]. When we have been influenced by something; [2]. Before new things are made; [3]. not enough information; [4]. When a formula has been followed;","completion":"[1]. When we have been influenced by something; The unique idea in a creative person comes when we have been influenced by something. This influence can be a result of several factors, such as personal experiences, exposure to various stimuli, subconscious efforts, or even encounters with others' creative works. It's important to note that creativity is not entirely random or a gift from the gods, but rather a complex interplay between various cognitive processes and external factors. While some unique ideas may seem to appear out of nowhere, there is often a lot happening subconsciously that influences our creativity. Our brains are continuously processing information received from our environment, and this influences the emergence of new ideas. These ideas can be further refined by skill and hard work, which are both essential components of creativity. Thus, a unique idea in a creative person is a result of being influenced by various factors and stimuli, followed by the cognitive processing of this information and its subsequent application in a creative manner. This makes creativity a dynamic and fluid concept, which is subject to change based on individual predispositions and experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: The film was the debut film for the character of Babar.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the paragraph. The relevant information is: \\"it is the second 'Babar' film, following ''.\\" Step 2: Interpret the relevant information. Since it is the second film in the series, there must be a film that preceded it. Step 3: Evaluate the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the film was the debut film for the character of Babar. However, as determined in Step 2, there was a film that preceded it, so it cannot be the debut film for the character. Conclusion: The hypothesis is false.
