Summarize this article: “Put a key logger in Kogan’s computer in Russia and you’ve got everything,” Mr. Wylie said. He added: “It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data. For me, that’s concerning and I think it should be looked into.” Mr. Wylie’s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data-mining, and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday. Georgia Rakusen, 33, a user researcher at a technology firm in London, urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing, which she called “absolutely gripping stuff.” His testimony, she said, “was something that, as a lay person, you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used.” “I think maybe people are just beginning to open up, to realize that maybe it’s not just about ads, maybe it’s not just what bands I like,” she said. Ms. Rakusen, who described her own work as “a space where we are supposed to make people click more,” said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more, looking at whistle-blowers like Mr. Wylie and Edward J. Snowden. “I didn’t watch the whole three and a half hours,” she said. “But I basically didn’t get any other work done during that time.” Mr. Wylie, who has described himself a “gay Canadian vegan,” dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and, still in his teens, began working for political campaigns. He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday, when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create. He said his views had changed when Mr. Trump was elected. “It was no longer this niche, shady firm,” he said. “It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world. It’s a process of coming to terms with what you have created, and the impact that has had.” ||||| Whistleblower Christopher Wylie who alleges that the campaign for Britain to leave the EU cheated in the referendum in 2016, speaking at a lawyers office to the media in London, Monday, March 26, 2018....

(Associated Press) Whistleblower Christopher Wylie who alleges that the campaign for Britain to leave the EU cheated in the referendum in 2016, speaking at a lawyers office to the media in London, Monday, March 26, 2018.... (Associated Press) LONDON (AP) — The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump's White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union. In a 3½-hour hearing, Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier — though he didn't give an exact figure. And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it. \\"All kinds of people had access to the data,\\" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. \\"It was everywhere.\\" Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said. Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost. The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year. Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing. Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who \\"has no direct knowledge of our work or practices\\" since he left the company. Wylie said he \\"absolutely\\" believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain's departure from the EU. \\"I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,\\" Wylie said. He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn't want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a \\"department,\\" he said. Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the \\"the next best thing\\" to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, \\"a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,\\" Wylie said. AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL. \\"AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,\\" the company said. \\"All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.\\" Wylie's testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign. They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds (888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ. Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations. Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave strategist, called Wylie a \\"fantasist-charlatan.\\" |||||","completion":"A man named Christopher Wylie said information from Facebook users may have been used in an improper way to help Donald Trump win the election and the Brexit movement in Britain.

Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, KB (3 September 1724 - 10 November 1808), known between 1776 and 1786 as Sir Guy Carleton, was an Anglo-Irish soldier and administrator. He twice served as Governor of the Province of Quebec, from 1768 to 1778, concurrently serving as Governor General of British North America in that time, and again from 1785 to 1795. The title Baron Dorchester was created on 21 August 1786. He commanded British troops in the American War of Independence, first leading the defence of Quebec during the 1775 rebel invasion and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. In August 1783, Carleton was informed that Great Britain would grant the United States its independence. With his exit from New York imminent, Carleton asked to be relieved of his command. With this news, Loyalists began an exodus from the Thirteen Colonies and Carleton did his best to have them resettled outside the United States. At a meeting with George Washington, among others, to arrange for the implementation of those parts of the Treaty of Paris relating to the evacuation of New York City, then commanded by Carleton and still occupied by the British Army, many Loyalists and former slaves, Carleton refused to deliver over the human property to the Americans at the time of the British evacuation. Instead, he proposed a registry so that \\"the owners might eventually be paid for the slaves who were entitled to their freedom by British Proclamation and promises.\\" Sir Guy noted that nothing could be changed in any Articles that were inconsistent with prior policies or National Honour. He added that the only mode was to pay for the Negroes, in which case justice was done to all, the former slaves and the owners. Carleton said that it would be a breach of faith not to honour the British policy of liberty to the Negro and declared that if removing them proved to be an infraction of the treaty, then compensation would have to be paid by the British government. To provide for such a contingency, he had a register kept of all Negroes who left, called the Book of Negroes, entering their names, ages, occupations, and names of their former masters. The Americans agreed to this, but as far as can be determined, the Crown never paid compensation. The British transported about 3,000 freedmen and other Loyalists to Nova Scotia for resettlement. As the colony struggled, some of the freedmen later chose in the early 1790s to go to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where the British set up a new colony, which included the Black Poor from London. Washington disagreed with Sir Guy's actions and wrote: \\"...the measure is totally different from the letter and spirit of the Treaty but waiving the specialty of the point, leaving this decision to our respective Sovereigns I find it my duty to signify my readiness in conjunction with you to enter into agreements, or take any measures which may be deemed expedient to prevent the future carrying away any Negroes or other property of the American people.\\" On 28 November, the evacuation was finished, and Carleton returned to England.

My f/1.4 50mm prime is heavier than this, and although that is partly a matter of plastic vs metal construction, having a lens that equals 300mm on digital barely weigh anything at all is great.

According to the premise, Section 424 does indeed provide a default method for distributing the allowances in the event that the Administrator is unable, for any reason, to promulgate allocation regulations on a timely basis. This default method serves as a backup plan to ensure the timely distribution of allowances for owners and operators to plan for compliance, even when regulations cannot be put in place in time. To understand this better, let's break down the premise: - The Administrator has a responsibility to promulgate allocation regulations for distributing allowances. - There might be circumstances where the Administrator cannot establish these regulations on a timely basis. - In such cases, Section 424 comes into play, providing a default method to distribute the allowances without promulgation of regulations. - This default procedure makes sure that the distribution of allowances takes place in advance of the year for which they are necessary, allowing owners and operators to plan for compliance. From this breakdown, it is evident that Section 424 plays a crucial role in ensuring the allowances' distribution even when regulations cannot be put into place by the Administrator. Hence, the given hypothesis is false, as Section 424 does provide a method of distribution as a contingency for situations where the establishment of allocation regulations becomes unfeasible."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: It appears that for a year or so government ministers, state officials and businessmen meeting for lunch or dinner in exclusive Warsaw restaurants were illegally recorded. There is speculation that waiters left a remote controlled device concealing a microphone on the diners' tables. At the moment, it is not known who did it or why, but fingers have already been pointed at opposition circles, wealthy businessmen or perhaps the Russian secret services, angered at Poland's tough stance in support of Kiev. The private conversations are frank, profane and revealing. In the latest batch of transcripts published by the weekly news magazine Wprost, a man identified as Poland's Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski brands the alliance with the US \\"worthless\\" and calls UK Prime Minister David Cameron \\"incompetent\\" in EU affairs. Enjoying a bowl of pumpkin soup, then a steak accompanied by a bottle of expensive wine, Mr Sikorski tells his dining partner, former Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski, that Warsaw's alliance with Washington is \\"complete bullshit\\". \\"We'll get into conflict with the Germans, with the Russians, and we'll think everything is super because we gave the Americans a blow job. Losers. Complete losers,\\" he continues. The magazine states that Mr Sikorski said Mr Cameron's attempts to appease Eurosceptics had backfired on him: \\"He's not interested, because he doesn't get it, because he believes in this stupid propaganda. He stupidly tries to manipulate the system.\\" This conversation seems strange for two men with close links to the UK who have repeatedly stated the EU will be better and stronger if the UK remains inside. Mr Sikorski read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford. He was a contemporary of Boris Johnson and a near-contemporary of David Cameron in the exclusive Bullingdon Club. For years he has publicly lauded the value of a strong security alliance with the US. Westminster School-educated Jacek Rostowski was once a member of Britain's Conservative Party. The conversation apparently took place in early 2014, shortly after Mr Cameron singled out Polish migrants for abusing the UK's benefits system. Comments that caused outrage in Poland. In terms of security, Russia was yet to annex Crimea. Mr Sikorski has bemoaned the level of support Washington has been willing to lend Poland in the past but since the Ukraine crisis there are more US troops in Poland than ever before. Mr Sikorski has not denied making the remarks. Both he and Prime Minister Donald Tusk say the government has come under attack from an \\"organised group of criminals\\". It is illegal to record a conversation in Poland without the participants' knowledge. In a tweet, Mr Sikorski wrote: \\"In UK, illegal taping of politicians and celebrities led to prosecutions for eavesdroppers and journalists. And the closing of the News of the World.\\" The need to uphold the law whilst protecting freedom of speech was at the heart of the most dramatic moment of this scandal. Last week, following the first set of revelations, security forces raided Wprost's offices to try to obtain the tapes. News channels were tipped off about the raids and plainclothes officers' attempts to wrestle the laptop out of the firm grip of the editor-in-chief, Sylwester Latkowski, were broadcast live. Outraged journalists began gathering in Wprost's offices to loudly protest against the action, which was judged \\"unacceptable\\" by the OSCE. Mr Tusk admitted his government would suffer as a result despite, he said, the raid being ordered by independent prosecutors investigating the illegal recordings. He added that if the crisis could not be contained, early elections were an option. A day later Wprost said a businessman who labelled himself \\"Patriot\\" sent them an email with internet links to four recordings. He was apparently the source of the first recordings too. On Tuesday, Polish media reported that one of the country's wealthiest businessmen, identified as Marek F, had been detained in the affair. The businessman is reportedly co-owner of one of the country's biggest coal distributors, skladywegla.pl. Earlier this month 10 managers from the company were arrested on suspicion of fraud, VAT extortion, and money laundering as part of a government investigation into illegal coal imports from Russia. Sections of the media are now focusing on who is behind the scandal and what their motivations are following the debacle of the Wprost raid. The daily Gazeta Wyborcza has reported that investigators are pursuing a theory that waiters and a manager at two exclusive Warsaw restaurants began recording businessmen. The tapes would then have been sold back later to those bugged. And then politicians began being recorded and those ended up in the hands of the person who supplied Wprost. The scandal has seriously damaged the reputation of Mr Tusk's government, which just a few weeks ago was enjoying renewed popularity for its leading role in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. Early elections might be avoided. The governing coalition has a majority. If it sticks together, it can vote down attempts to unseat it.","completion":"For over a year, government ministers, state officials, and businessmen were illegally recorded during lunch or dinner meetings in exclusive Warsaw restaurants.

This conversation contradicts their public statements supporting strong alliances with the US and UK. The conversation seems to have taken place in early 2014 when Cameron criticized Polish migrants for abusing the UK's benefits system.

Die Diskussion über die digitale Dividende sollte sich nicht auf die Wahl zwischen Schwarz und Weiß, zwischen Kommerzialisierung und sozialem Nutzen reduzieren. Translate to English English:","completion":"The discussion about the digital dividend should not be reduced to a choice between black and white, between commercialization and social benefit. The digital dividend is a term used to describe the potential social and economic benefits that can be derived from the widespread use of digital technology, including improved access to information, increased productivity, and greater social inclusion. It is clear that the digital revolution has had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on society and the economy. However, the discussion surrounding the digital dividend should not be a simple binary choice between commercialization and social benefit. Instead, it should focus on finding a balance that maximizes the potential positive outcomes while minimizing any negative consequences. One of the central issues in this debate is the question of digital inequality - the \\"digital divide.\\" As technology becomes increasingly integral to our daily lives, those on the wrong side of the digital divide are at risk of being left behind. Ensuring that everyone has equal access to technology and its benefits is key to realizing the full potential of the digital dividend, regardless of whether the focus is on commercialization or social benefit. For example, if the emphasis was solely on commercialization, it might lead to a world where only those who can afford the latest technology have access to its potential benefits. The gap between the haves and the have-nots would widen, exacerbating the existing social and economic inequalities. Conversely, focusing exclusively on social benefit could stifle innovation and slow down progress. Companies and investors would be less likely to allocate resources to the development of new technologies if they believe the financial return on investment would be limited. Finding the right balance is crucial. Public policies should encourage investment in technology and innovation while also promoting digital education and skills development. This would enable individuals to participate fully in the digital world while ensuring society benefits from the potential of new technologies. Additionally, collaboration between the public and private sectors is key to achieving this balance. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can help address the challenges of both commercialization and social benefit by incentivizing innovation while also ensuring technology benefits reach everyone in society. In conclusion, the discussion about the digital dividend should not be limited to choosing between commercialization or social benefit. Instead, it should focus on finding the balance between the two. By fostering the right mix of investment, innovation, and ensuring equal access to technology, the digital dividend can ultimately serve the broader interests of society and contribute to a more equitable and prosperous future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Phase I of the 50 million project will be a water and snow park. Groundbreaking is anticipated late this year or in early 2013, with the park's opening slated for summer of 2014. Parton, who turned 66 on Thursday, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin that \\"we are going to be bringing more family entertainment into Nashville.\\" The Dollywood company will serve as the project's operating partner and will employ 450 full- and part-time employees, Parton said. The park will provide a mix of high-energy water activities for the summer season and designated snow activities for winter play. The first-year attendance is projected to be a half-million. The park will be similar to the Snow Mountain attraction at Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta, according to CNN affiliate WKRN. \\"Tourism is the second-largest industry in Tennessee, generating more than a billion dollars in tax revenue annually and employing more than 170,000 Tennesseans,\\" Gov. Bill Haslam said in a statement. \\"This project will be a welcome addition to the wide variety of attractions and destinations across our great state, and I applaud the collaboration and spirit that has led to this announcement.\\" \\"We are thrilled by the prospect of bringing to Nashville a family focused entertainment center with one of the pre-eminent theme park owners and operators in the country,\\" said Colin V.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a question with answer options. Goal: How thick should a table top be for a homemade table? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options: A). Three quarters inch is a good sturdy thickness.; B). One quarter inch is a good sturdy thickness.;...I think the answer is","completion":"Option A). Three quarters inch is a good sturdy thickness. A homemade table should have a tabletop with an optimal balance between sturdiness and aesthetics. Based on the options provided and considering the purpose and endurance of a table, a thickness of three quarters of an inch (3/4\\") would be more reasonable for a tabletop. There are several factors to consider when determining the ideal thickness for a tabletop, including the material, the size of the table, and its intended use. Here is a more detailed explanation of why a tabletop thickness of 3/4\\" would be appropriate. 1. Material: Hardwood is a common choice for tabletops, given its durability and visual appeal. A thickness of 3/4\\" would provide sufficient stability and weight distribution for most types of hardwood, such as oak, maple, or walnut. Thinner materials like one quarter inch could potentially cause the tabletop to warp or crack over time, especially if exposed to fluctuating temperatures or moisture. 2. Size of the table: The size of the table also impacts the required thickness of the tabletop. A larger table will need a thicker top to support the weight of the items placed on it and to maintain its rigidity. For standard-sized tables, a 3/4\\" thick tabletop should provide adequate support. However, if the table dimensions are larger, such as for a conference or dining table, a thickness of approximately 1\\" to 1.5\\" might be more appropriate. 3. Intended use: A table's purpose plays a significant role in determining its thickness. If the table will primarily be used for activities that do not exert much stress on the surface (e.g., writing or gaming), a 3/4\\" thick tabletop should be sufficient. In contrast, a workbench or craft table might require a thicker top, considering the heavy-duty usage and weight of tools or equipment placed on it. 4. Aesthetic considerations: Visual appeal is another factor to consider when selecting the tabletop thickness. A 3/4\\" thick tabletop often looks more balanced and proportional in relation to the table legs and frame. A one-quarter-inch tabletop may appear flimsy or insubstantial, which could undermine the overall appearance of the table. Taking all these factors into account, a thickness of three quarters of an inch (3/4\\") would be a more reasonable choice for a homemade table compared to one-quarter inch. A 3/4\\" thick tabletop offers durability, stability, and a visually appealing design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

So she went to the sheep and told him the situation.The sheep replied,\\"Another time,my dear friend.I do not like to have anything to do with it,as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares.\\" The hare then went,as a last hope,to the calf ,who regretted that he was unable to help her,as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself.By this time the hounds were quite near,and the hare took to her heels and luckily escaped. Question: What does the story want to tell us? Answer: A:","completion":"The story wants to tell us that having too many friends means no friends sometimes. It illustrates that in times of need, one cannot always rely on their numerous friends, as they might not come through when assistance is required. In the story, the hare believed she had many friends among the other animals, but when she found herself in danger from the hounds, none of her so-called friends were willing or able to help her. The horse was busy with important work, the bull had an appointment with a lady, the goat feared harming her, the sheep worried about the hounds harming him, and the calf did not want to take responsibility for her situation. Despite the hare's popularity and the promises made by her many friends, none of them proved to be dependable when it mattered most. This highlights the reality that having a large number of friends may not guarantee support or loyalty, especially in times of crisis. Instead, it is often better to have a few reliable and trustworthy friends who can be counted on when needed. Overall, the story teaches us a valuable lesson about the importance of evaluating the quality of friendships rather than focusing on the quantity of social connections. While having many friends may seem desirable, it is essential to recognize that true friends are those who can be relied upon in times of difficulty and offer genuine support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Republicans woke up Sunday to a wave of new polls that showed their Senate candidates surging ahead in key states -- including one in Iowa that looked particularly grim for Democrats -- giving the GOP a jolt of enthusiasm going into the 2014 campaign cycle's final hours. Two days from the midterm election, Washington's political class was buzzing around news that Iowa GOP Senate hopeful Joni Ernst was 7 percentage points up in a Des Moines Register poll, and Republican candidates and surrogates popped up on the Sunday news shows, gleeful about their prospects. \\"I think the wind is at our back,\\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\" He added that Republicans will \\"in all likelihood\\" win control of the Senate and added: \\"I think people are ready for new leadership.\\" Fueling the Republicans' optimism was a Register poll that showed Ernst leading Democrat Bruce Braley, 51% to 44% -- prompting pollster J. Ann Selzer to tell the newspaper that \\"this race looks like it's decided.\\" Hours before the poll's release, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spelled out what a loss in the Hawkeye State would mean for Democrats. \\"Iowa is critical. There's no other way to say it,\\" Reid said Saturday in a conference call with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \\"Joni Ernst would mean â€” coming to the United States Senate â€” that Mitch McConnell would be leader of the United States Senate, who agrees with her on everything,\\" he said, according to Politico. And it wasn't just Iowa that had good news for Republicans. A new set of NBC News/Marist polls unveiled Sunday morning gave Republicans boosts in three key Senate races -- including McConnell's in Kentucky, as well as Georgia, where Democrats had hoped to pickup a seat, and Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in a tough race for her political career. Those incumbent Senate Democrats have spent the fall trying to distance themselves from President Barack Obama, whose floundering state-level approval ratings have been a drag for his party down the ticket as Republicans tie their opponents to the commander-in-chief every chance they get. \\"This is really the last chance for America to pass judgment on the Obama administration and its policies,\\" former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" Of course, polls are no guarantee for how elections will turn out on Tuesday, as the past several elections for midterms and the presidential race were dogged by major network surveys that turned out to be very different from the actual results. And Democrats cite the 2010 example of Colorado where Republican Ken Buck was consistently polling ahead in the final weeks of that race, only to be defeated by now Sen. Michael Bennet. Democrats swung back on the Sunday shows as well to make the case that their early voting numbers suggest they'll hold onto some of those seats. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said on ABC's \\"This Week\\" that her party's candidates will benefit from get-out-the-vote efforts targeting people who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012, but didn't vote in the 2010 midterm elections. \\"We have a ground game that I know [RNC chairman] Reince [Priebus] would take ours over theirs any day of the week,\\" she said. She also pointed to Democratic surrogates -- including former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- and said they trounce GOP surrogates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But Priebus shot back that \\"our ground game is whipping their ground game.\\" \\"Look, if Americans who want change vote on Tuesday, the Democrats are going to have a terrible night. We're going to have a great night,\\" he said. \\"And it's because Barack Obama's policies and Debbie Wasserman Schultz's policies and Harry Reid's policies are on the ballot.\\" The GOP needs to pick up six seats to win a Senate majority, and with several other victories all but guaranteed, losses in swing states like Iowa could seal Democrats' fate. Senate Republican leader McConnell is ahead of Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, 50% to 41%, according to an NBC News/Marist survey released Sunday. Democrats had hoped the contest would be among their few chances to pick off a GOP-held seat or at least divert resources from other key Senate races. Another of those targets is Georgia, but the Republican nominee there, David Perdue, has jumped to a 48% to 44% lead over Democrat Michelle Nunn, the NBC News/Marist survey found. That lead might not be enough to clench that race. To win in Georgia, candidates must earn more than 50% of the vote -- and if neither Perdue nor Nunn are able to reach that mark, they'd face each other again in a run-off election in January. In Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in trouble, too. The NBC News/Marist poll found her at 44% support, but in the state's \\"jungle primary\\" she's facing two Republicans -- Rep. Bill Cassidy and tea party candidate Rob Maness. If Landrieu falls short of 50%, she'd face just one of those Republicans in a December run-off -- and without conservatives' votes being split, she'd be the underdog. The GOP is all but certain to win seats now held by retiring Democrats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. They're also favored in Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana -- states consistently won by Republican presidential candidates. Wins in swing state targets like Iowa, Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire would offer a huge boost to Republicans' chances -- and would insulate the party from potential losses in Georgia and Kansas, where independent challenger Greg Orman hasn't said who he'd caucus with and therefore can't be considered a reliable supporter of either party. Top Democrats, trying to narrow the gap, hit the trail Sunday, including Bill Clinton, who planned four stops in Arkansas -- where Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is endangered and long-time Clinton foil Asa Hutchinson is expected to win the governor's race. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, was in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan are both facing stiff challenges in their re-election bids. She'll also attend the funeral for long-time Boston mayor Tom Menino. Obama, who's stayed away from most Senate races this year with the rare exception of a Saturday visit to Michigan on behalf of Democratic candidate Gary Peters, is in Connecticut Sunday to campaign for Gov. Dannel Malloy. Republicans are flocking to Kansas, where Orman is threatening to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. The party's 1996 presidential nominee, Bob Dole, and former Sen. Rick Santorum are campaigning for Roberts on Sunday. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a likely 2016 White House contender, is swinging through South Carolina, Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Another potential presidential candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, is with Republican Dan Sullivan in Alaska, trying to help the Republican knock off first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Begich. The Florida governor's race -- one of the nation's tightest -- is also getting the attention of big names in both parties. Biden is campaigning for the Democratic candidate, Charlie Crist, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is making stops with Republican Gov. Rick Scott.","completion":"In the article, it talks about how the Republicans saw many new polls that showed their Senate candidates doing really well in some important states. This made them very excited and hopeful for the upcoming 2014 elections. One poll in Iowa showed the Republican candidate, Joni Ernst, 7 percentage points ahead of the Democrat candidate, Bruce Braley. This made people think that the Republicans might take control of the Senate. Other polls showed that Republicans were also doing well in other states like Kentucky, Georgia, and Louisiana. Many Democrats tried to separate themselves from the President, Barack Obama, because some people did not like his decisions. Some people in the article said that voting for the Republicans would be a way for people to say they did not like the decisions made by President Obama and other Democrats. However, the article also says that these poll results are not always correct and can sometimes be very different from the results of the actual elections. Election results can change a lot depending on how many people actually go out and vote. Both Republicans and Democrats are working hard to get people to vote for their candidates, and famous people from both parties are helping out as well. So, the article talks about how Republicans are excited because they see many polls showing them doing well in important elections. This makes them think that they might take control of the Senate and be able to make more decisions in the government. But, we have to remember that polls are not always right and that a lot can change depending on who actually votes in the elections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet? Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Let Children Roam Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \\"culture of fear\\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the question The question asks how a decrease in sunlight will affect the production of sugar (glucose) and oxygen in plants, specifically in relation to the second effect mentioned (i.e., production of glucose through photosynthesis). Step 2: Analyzing the effect of less sunlight on photosynthesis If there is less sunlight shining on the plants, then there will be less energy available for the plant's leaves to capture and use in the process of photosynthesis. Step 3: Evaluating the effect on glucose production As photosynthesis is the process through which plants convert sunlight into glucose, having less sunlight available will directly result in less glucose being produced. This is because the plants will have less energy to break down the sunlight into glucose. Step 4: Evaluating the effect on oxygen production During photosynthesis, plants also produce oxygen as a byproduct. Since the process is now receiving less energy due to the decrease in sunlight, the production of oxygen will also be affected and decrease accordingly.

Typically, the back of the refrigerator is the coldest part, which will help preserve the flavor and texture of the caviar. Do not open the tin until you are ready to eat it, as this will decrease its shelf life. It is a good idea to only purchase the amount you expect to eat in a single sitting. However, if you do have leftover caviar, return it to the original tin, place a piece of plastic wrap over the top, and close the tin securely. Then, put the tin back into the refrigerator for 1-3 days to keep the taste fresh. To preserve the flavor, only use coated dishes and spoons when you're serving caviar. Avoid serving the caviar with a metal spoon or dish, as the delicacy will absorb the metal flavors. If you do not have one of these special spoons, grab a simple plastic or wooden spoon instead. You can purchase caviar spoons at your local department store in the kitchenware section or online with major retailers. Caviar is a delicate dish that should be kept chilled. This will help preserve the flavors and quality of the product. You could also rest the caviar bowl on an ice pack if you don't have any crushed ice on hand. To get the most from the experience, bring the caviar to your nose and inhale the aroma, then taste a small amount. Try not to chew the caviar or you might miss some of the more subtle flavors, as well as the unique texture. Instead, use your tongue to roll the eggs around in your mouth. Caviar is very rich, and it’s meant to be tasted or served in small amounts. If you are eating it plain, aim for 1/2 tsp (2.67 g) of caviar per tasting. If you are including it in a meal or as an appetizer, use approximately 1-3 tsp (5.33-16 g) of caviar. Since caviar is a traditional Russian delicacy, it is often paired with vodka. The vodka complements the flavors of the caviar and cleanses your palate between tastings. If you’d prefer something a little lighter, though, caviar and champagne go together very nicely. Summary:","completion":"This article provides detailed guidance on preserving and enjoying caviar, recommending caviar be kept cold, properly sealed, and served in small portions on non-metal utensils to maintain flavor, pairing the delicacy with vodka or champagne for optimal taste experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can get a sense of what an 1972 America gone by was like by watching this movie. I found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now. Just think...back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc, etc. The Vietnam war was just over. There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away. When this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it. So it began touring small Protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors(This was the days before VCRS of course). The pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing A Thief in the NIght to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film. Then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room.

Article: When picking out pieces, make sure you have solid pieces that you can wear in a variety of scenarios. You want a wardrobe that will take you from work to out to dinner without having too many pieces that are only for one type of occasion. For instance, a nice pair of pants that fits will can be made professional with a nice jacket and a blouse. For slightly dressier dinner, take off the jacket and add a scarf. As another example, a knee length skirt in a solid color is appropriate for work with a solid color on top, but it could also work for brunch with friends if you add few accessories. for your workhorse pieces. When it comes to fashion, the basic neutral colors are black, navy blue, browns, grays, and tans. Because neutrals don't tend to go well together in the same outfit, picking and sticking to one or two will help you create more outfits with less pieces. Buy versatile items like skirts, pants, belts, and coats in your chosen neutral(s). White is also technically a neutral color, but it can be paired with other neutrals. Unless you're buying complete outfits at the same time, never buy a piece unless you know what you'll wear it with. Before buying an item, mentally create one or more outfits using it and pieces you already own. Even though you love an item, it just may never fit into your wardrobe if it's not your usual style, which means you won't wear it. Skipping this step can lead to a lot of unworn pieces that just sit in your closet. The first step of building a wardrobe isn't buying anything; it's streamlining what you already have. Go through your closet and look for pieces you never wear. Eliminating these will make choosing good clothes much easier. You can sell your old clothes online, if you're short on cash. Another option is to give them to charity. You'll even get a credit on your taxes for the donation, if you get a receipt. Some charities will pick up donations, so you don't have to go anywhere.

In this case, the equation is already simplified, so we can move on to the next step. Step 2: Isolate the variable u. We want to get u on one side of the equation and all the constants on the other side. First, we need to eliminate the 9*u from the left side of the equation. To do this, subtract 9*u from both sides: 9*u + 4 - 9*u = 10*u - 9*u This simplifies to: 4 = u Step 3: Check the solution. Verify that the solution found in Step 2 satisfies the original equation: 9*(4) + 4 = 10*(4) 36 + 4 = 40 40 = 40 The solution checks out, confirming that u = 4 is the correct solution to the original equation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Overnight trips to Rome could become even more expensive as the Italian capital considers hiking its hotel tax just four months after it was doubled. The proposal calls for the tourist tax to increase to €10 a night (approximately £7.60) at five-star hotels, according to local media, despite fears that it would deter tourists from planning a holiday in The Eternal City. It comes after Rome’s government hiked the tax to between €3 and €7, depending on the type of hotel, last September. Tourists would be forced to pay even more while staying in Rome if the city's hikes its luxury hotel tax. The Italian Hotel Association, which represents angry hotel owners, announced that it is ‘concerned’ by Rome’s decision to increase the tax at luxury hotels. Giorgio Palmucci, the association’s president, told media that the local council ‘takes no account of the dynamics of the tourist market that could be an important key to development and jobs for the city.’ He questioned whether tourists would see any additional services following another tax increase and pointed out that cities such as London and Madrid do not apply a tourist tax, while Paris’ tax is ‘marginal’. Local media say the tax would increase to €10 a night at five-star hotels (pictured: Regina Hotel Baglioni) He added: ‘There is no doubt that such a chose will not have negative impact on businesses but also on the image of the city.’ Hotelier Steve Brenner told The Local that a tax increase for luxury hotels would affect the broader tourism industry, calling it a ‘very shirt-sighted plan’ from an ‘out of touch’ government. The owner of The Beehive Hotel in central Rome said: ‘I had ten people come in the other day. It was €157 in tourist tax for their stay, I was embarrassed.’ He said he has seen little evidence that the tax is being used to improve services for tourists or residents. Rome's hotel association fears another tax increase would deter tourists from planning a holiday in the city. Last September, when the tourist tax was doubled, the World Travel & Tourism Council said hotels risked losing business as it would drive tourists away and heavily punish Rome’s travel and tourism sector. It said the ‘punitive’ tax sends the message that travellers are not welcome in Rome and its tourism industry ‘does not matter’. The organisation is calling on the ‘counter-productive’ tax, which was introduced in 2010, to be scrapped. Highlights:","completion":"1.

In order to win her love, Striker overcomes his fear and buys a ticket on a flight she is serving on, from Los Angeles to Chicago. However, during the flight, Elaine rebuffs his attempts.After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) quickly realizes that one of the meal options gave the passengers food poisoning. The stewards discover that the pilot crew, including Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have all come down with food poisoning, leaving no one aboard to fly the plane. Elaine is instructed by the Chicago control tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot a large blow-up doll named \\"Otto\\" which will get them to Chicago but will not be able to land the plane.

As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers.

It is a hunting and tracking dog descended from bloodhounds of medieval times. It was first introduced into France in the 1980s and is still a very rare breed. It was cross-bred with the Bavarian Hound which gave rise to the Bavarian Mountain Hound. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hanover Hounds are a rare breed of dog, therefore there are many individuals who try to obtain one.","completion":"While it is true that the Hanover Hound is a rare breed of dog, the conclusion that many individuals try to obtain one may not be entirely accurate. Rarity in a breed does not automatically equate to a high demand. Instead, it is important to consider the characteristics and traits of the breed, as well as public awareness of its existence, to determine the demand for a particular breed, such as the Hanover Hound. The Hanover Hound, as mentioned earlier, is a hunting and tracking dog primarily used for its excellent scent tracking capabilities. It is a versatile breed, capable of working in various terrains, including forests and mountains. The breed is known for its intelligence, loyalty, and perseverance. Physically, Hanover Hounds are muscular and sturdy, with a characteristic liver (reddish-brown) coat and folded ears. While these traits make the Hanover Hound an undoubtedly impressive breed, the demand for these dogs may not be as high as one might initially presume. There are several reasons for this: 1. Limited public awareness: Since the Hanover Hound is rare and has been introduced to different countries relatively recently, it is still not as well-known as other traditional hunting or tracking breeds. As a result, potential buyers or enthusiasts may not be aware of the breed and its unique characteristics. 2. Specialized usage: Hanover Hounds are foremost hunting and tracking dogs, which means that potential owners should ideally have experience in such activities and have an appropriate living environment for the breed. This limits the general appeal of this breed as the majority of the dog-owning population may not be involved in hunting or tracking activities. 3. Availability of alternative breeds: Many other dog breeds possess excellent hunting and tracking abilities, such as the Bloodhound, the Beagle, the English Pointer, or the German Shorthaired Pointer. These breeds are likely to be more well-known, easier to find, and potentially more suitable for a wider range of owners. Thus, some people may prefer these more popular breeds over the rarer Hanover Hound. 4. Societal shifts: The popularity of certain dog breeds shifts with time as societal preferences and priorities change. Over the years, there has been a noticeable shift towards companion dogs and breeds suitable for urban living, as opposed to working breeds like the Hanover Hound. This trend may dampen the demand for Hanover Hounds. In conclusion, while the Hanover Hound is indeed a rare breed, it does not automatically signify that many individuals actively try to obtain one. Demand for any breed is influenced by various factors, such as public awareness, specialized usage, availability of alternative breeds, and societal trends. Although the Hanover Hound possesses impressive qualities, its limited public awareness, specialized usage, and possible preference for more well-known breeds likely contribute to a more moderate demand for this particular breed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This suggests that Bhutan could have a more sustainable approach to resource use, which is less likely to lead to environmental degradation. 4. Based on the information provided, we can't say for sure that there are no other factors that might affect Bhutan's environment that are not mentioned. However, as we only have to base our analysis on the provided information, we lean towards Bhutan having a more sustainable approach. Answer: Given the information, Bhutan's environment is most likely to sustain rather than degrade, as it focuses on citizens' well-being without indulging in overconsumption patterns like Qatar does.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Background: Peter Rene Baumann (born 5 January 1968), better known as DJ BoBo, is a Swiss singer-songwriter, dancer and music producer. He has sold 14 million records worldwide and has released 12 studio albums as well as a few compilation albums which have included his previous hits in a reworked format. DJ BoBo has also released as many as 34 singles to date, some of which have charted high, not only in German speaking countries, but also in other European territories. As a dance music producer, his first big success came with the single \\"Somebody Dance with Me\\", which borrows its melody from Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me. Context: The release of the album World in Motion in September, 1996, proved not only DJ BoBo's consistent presence in the charts, but with this album, Rene managed to break all his previous records. It took only a few weeks for the album to reach the No.3 position in Germany, which quickly was awarded Platinum for selling 500,000 units. In Switzerland, the album jumped from 0 to No.1 and was awarded Double-Platinum for selling 100,000 units, which was ranked in the top 40 albums of all-time, after remaining on the Swiss album chart for a staggering 67 weeks. Shortly after the release of World in Motion, Baumann went on a promotional tour in Asia for twenty days, which was then followed by another one month-tour in Brazil, Chile and Colombia. In April 1997, DJ BoBo received his third World Music Award in Monaco for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" where he performed his single \\"Respect Yourself\\". DJ BoBo maintained his original sound and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements when he introduced his singing skills first on his single \\"Where Is Your Love\\", which was released in March, 1998. A month thereafter, in April 1998, his album Magic was released which managed to stay in the No.1 position for four consecutive weeks in his native country and earned him a Platinum-award for sales of over 50,000 units. In Germany, the album peaked at No.5 and spent total of 21 weeks on the chart, eventually earning the Swiss artist another Gold-award for sales of over 250,000 units. In May of that the same year, DJ BoBo received the World Music Award for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" once again for the fourth time. Soon after, his single \\"Celebrate\\" was released introducing his The Ultimate Megamix '99. During this time Rene and his crew were busy preparing for his \\"Life on Tour\\" concert as well as the shows of the Magic, which were watched by 250,000 people in 35 concert arenas in Europe.

Trying to snap a four-game losing skid, the Broncos flew to the University of Phoenix Stadium for a Week 15 interconference fight with the Arizona Cardinals. The last time these two teams met each other, Denver won 37-7 at Invesco Field at Mile High on December 29, 2002. This time, it was a battle of rookie quarterbacks as Matt Leinart went up against Jay Cutler. In the first quarter, the Cardinals trailed early as Cutler completed a 54-yard TD pass to WR Javon Walker and kicker Jason Elam nailed a 30-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Arizona trailed even further with Elam's 22-yard field goal.

This article: Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\". Soon, Donald returns to his old self and forgets about his singing career and Daisy regains her lover. contains an answer for the question: Who does the psychologest give a dilemma to?, what is it ?","completion":"The psychologist in the article \\"Donald's Dilemma\\" gives a dilemma to Daisy Duck.

This choice forces Daisy to decide between her own needs and the happiness of the wider world. In the end, Daisy chooses herself with a resounding and possessive scream, leading to Donald returning to his old self and forgetting about his singing career, while Daisy regains her lover."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Both are actions involving violence or force, which puts them in the same semantic class. Step 2: Determine if X is a specific instance of Y (HYPER) Abuse can refer to various types of harmful behaviors or actions, one of which could be hitting someone. In this sense, hitting someone could be considered a specific instance of abuse. Step 3: If neither COORD nor HYPER are applicable, then the relationship is RANDOM Since we found that X and Y share a HYPER relationship (from Step 2), we do not need to consider RANDOM.

I found the following answer on Google: For example, a scoop attached to the end of a rope or pole by which a man can draw sediments up from the bottom of a pond is a dredger. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"Yes, that is a correct but basic example of a dredge. However, I will provide a more detailed answer for a better understanding. A dredge is a machine or device used to remove sediments, debris, or other materials from the bottom of bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, harbors, and other water channels. Dredging helps to maintain or increase the depth of waterways and is crucial for navigation, excavation, and environmental applications. There are different kinds of dredges, each designed for specific purposes and types of sediment materials. Here's a brief overview of some common types of dredges: 1. Mechanical dredges: These dredges use a cable-arm configuration with a clamshell, bucket, or scoop-like device attached at the end. The dredge operator lowers the device into the water, grabs the sediment from the bottom, and then lifts it up and deposits it into a barge or articulated dump truck. 2. Hydraulic dredges: These dredges use suction to remove sediments and debris from the bottom. A cutter suction dredge, for example, features a rotating cutter head at the end of a suction pipe that loosens the sediment material. The sediment is then mixed with water to create a slurry, which is pumped through a pipeline to a designated disposal site (often called a spoil area). 3. Suction dredges: These dredges use a vacuum-like system to suck up sediment from the bottom of bodies of water. Instead of a cutter head, they usually employ a simple suction pipe. Suction dredges are often used for small-scale operations or when dealing with loose materials like sand. 4. Hopper dredges: Hopper dredges are self-propelled vessels that store dredged sediment in a large \\"hopper\\", which is an onboard storage bin. When the hopper is full, the dredge transports the material to the designated disposal site and releases it. Hopper dredges are often used for maintaining large, deep waterways. 5. Air-lift dredges: These dredges rely on air pressure to create a vacuum for sucking up sediments. They use an air compressor to pump air through a hose, which then injects the air into a pipe submerged in the water. The rising air bubbles create suction, drawing water and sediment into the pipe. The dredged materials are then discharged into a container or another vessel. Overall, dredging plays a crucial role in maintaining navigable waterways, mining resources such as sand and other materials, and assisting in water management and restoration efforts for both man-made and natural lakes, waterways, and ponds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They had the play multiple times, but we preferred it at the school over the coliseum because the Choose from: [A]. school is more familiar since I am a student. [B]. coliseum is more familiar since I am a student.","completion":"[A]. school is more familiar since I am a student. They had the play multiple times, but we preferred it at the school over the coliseum because the school is more familiar since I am a student. There are a few reasons that made the school a better choice for us to enjoy the performance. First and foremost, as a student at the school, I am well-acquainted with the campus grounds, which gave me a sense of comfort and ease in navigating my way to the venue. I didn't have to second guess where to park, where the restrooms were located, or how to find my friends in the crowd. These little details made attending the play at the school much more enjoyable for me. In addition to the familiarity aspect, attending the play at the school made it easier for me to connect with the performers, as most of them were also my fellow students. They did a stellar job portraying their characters and delivering their lines, but knowing that we shared the same hallways and classrooms made it even more exciting to see them bring these roles to life. It helped me to appreciate their talent and dedication even more, as I was aware of the commitments we all have as students, balancing academics and extracurricular activities. Moreover, by choosing the school as the venue, we supported the local arts scene and provided much-needed encouragement to these budding talents. By cheering on our friends and classmates, we were not only showing our support for their passion, but also recognizing their growth as artists. Furthermore, the revenue generated from ticket sales directly benefitted the school's theater department, which is essential for maintaining and expanding a thriving arts program. Another advantage of attending the play at the school over the coliseum was the more intimate setting that the school auditorium provided. This smaller venue allowed for an up-close and personal experience, enabling us to truly appreciate the emotions and nuances in each actor's performance. In contrast, the coliseum would have put us further away from the stage, making it difficult for us to connect with the story being told. Finally, attending the play at the school meant that we also saved on transportation, as we wouldn't have to worry about traveling to the coliseum and finding parking spaces. Additionally, ticket prices were typically more affordable, making the school location a budget-friendly choice for us. This allowed us to take part in an enjoyable cultural experience without breaking the bank. In conclusion, we chose to attend the play at the school over the coliseum because it provided a familiar, accessible, and supportive environment. The intimate atmosphere of the school auditorium, the sense of community fostered through supporting fellow students, and the more economical choice all contributed to making this decision the right one for us. We not only enjoyed a fantastic performance but also took pride in being part of a nurturing community that values the arts and encourages young talents to pursue their passions."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"Explain the decline in number of the Arawak and Spain's response to this decline.\\" Answer: \\"Pig breeding and sugarcane, waited in the harbor\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, this answer is not correct. Let me explain it to you like you're a 5-year-old: The Arawak people lived in Jamaica before the Spanish people came.

Article: Lettuce has been eaten for over 4,500 years, and was known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. Question: What can we infer from the passage?

Context: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Question: Why did IMB hire so many designers?

In a 13-page audit obtained by the Daily News, Controller William Thompson found the no-frills office where thousands of lovebirds get hitched every year isn't protecting blank marriage and domestic partnership certificates. \\"There is no assurance that all blank certificates and licenses are accounted for,\\" Thompson wrote in the audit. The city clerk's office, which oversees the marriage bureau, is required to keep the certificates in a locked room. But Thompson found stacks of them in unlocked desk drawers and file cabinets. \\"We observed unsecured forms in six places,\\" Thompson said, noting the documents are \\"easily susceptible to theft.\\" Spouses and domestic partners are eligible for valuable benefits, including health insurance and pensions. The city clerk also keeps no clear record of how many blank certificates are in the office, Thompson found. There have been no reports of theft or abuse of blank certificates.

Joe: The Rise of Cobra Movie plot: The film opens in France, in 1641. The Scotsman Klan McCullen has been accused of selling weaponry to both the Scots and French. Rather than being executed for treason, the jury brands his face with a white-hot mask in order to humiliate him. In the near future, weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) has created a nanotechnology-based weapon capable of destroying an entire city. His company MARS sells four warheads to NATO, and the U.S. Army is tasked with delivering the warheads. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are delivering the warheads when they are ambushed by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), who Duke recognized to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in North Africa, and upon arriving rendezvous with General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the head of the G.I. Joe Team. Hawk takes command of the war-heads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to have them join his group after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to bring panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), inflicting casualties on several G.I. Joe soldiers. After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize and use them to destroy the Eiffel Tower to serve as a showing of the warhead's destructive power. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue them through the streets but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching the missile. Duke manages to hit the kill switch, but in doing so he is...

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer? , can you please find it? As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Åkerfeldt.

Summarize this article: Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland lost their first two Six Nations matches, against England and Wales, and defeat in Rome would make it 10 successive championship defeats stretching back to 2014. \\"Our performances have been fairly good but it's a results-based business,\\" said 23-year-old Hogg. He said the Scotland players are \\"definitely not looking at the record\\". Scotland's most recent victory in the Six Nations was their 21-20 win at the Stadio Olimpico two years ago, courtesy of Duncan Weir's late drop goal. After the trip to Italy, they face France at Murrayfield on 13 March and Ireland in Dublin on 19 March. \\"We are dying to get that win and we have been working incredibly hard,\\" said Glasgow Warriors' Hogg. \\"Getting a win would do wonders for us. If we were to get that win then I can see us winning the next two games as well. \\"The last couple of weeks have been bitterly disappointing, having come away with two defeats, but Saturday is a chance to make amends.\\" Italy are bottom of the Six Nations table after also losing their opening two matches, against France and England. They beat Scotland 22-19 at Murrayfield in last year's Six Nations thanks to a late penalty try.

Both teams have lost their first two matches in the championship, increasing the importance of their head-to-head game. Scotland's last victory in the Six Nations was a 21-20 win against Italy in 2014, and they face the possibility of their 10th consecutive championship defeat. Stuart Hogg, a Scottish player, has commented that the team is working hard to achieve a win that would boost their morale and possibly lead to further wins against France and Ireland later in March. Italy also faces pressure as the Six Nations' bottom-ranked team, having lost their opening matches against France and England. Their captain, Sergio Parisse, acknowledges that playing at home may add additional pressure, but he remains confident in his team's strengths. Italy previously achieved a close victory against Scotland in the 2015 Six Nations with a score of 22-19, and the matchup between the two teams is consistently expected to be fiercely competitive.

It's reasonable to hypothesize that some residents of Atlee might work in construction or related industries due to the presence of these major routes. Major roads and highways often require regular maintenance and improvement, which could potentially provide local employment opportunities.

Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a dhampir, to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a shape shifter; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a werewolf. Throughout the course of the film, two of the Marcus brothers, Nolt and Kyle, end up being killed by the mutant Barbarois, while Leila and Borgoff continue their search for Charlotte.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight.

The reason behind this lies in the role this city played in the success of the Apollo 11 mission, which marked a significant milestone in human space exploration. Houston, Texas, is home to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, more commonly known as the \\"Johnson Space Center,\\" which has been the iconic site for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) human spaceflight activities. The space center was established in 1961, and it provided extensive support for the Apollo mission. On July 20, 1969, when Apollo 11's lunar module \\"Eagle\\", carrying astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, successfully detached from the command module and began its descent towards the Moon's surface, astronaut Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command module \\"Columbia\\". During this critical phase of the mission, the team on Earth, including mission control in Houston, remained in constant communication with the astronauts. As astronaut Neil Armstrong guided the lunar module towards the surface, he uttered the iconic phrase, \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Armstrong was sharing the news of the lunar landing with Houston's mission control, making the city name \\"Houston\\" one of the first words spoken on the Moon. The term \\"Tranquility Base\\" was used to describe the location of the landing site, which was intentionally chosen for its relative flatness and appearance of a relatively safe environment for the historic first moon landing.

The name was defined by the Constitution of 1952 which was based on the 1936 Soviet Constitution. Between 1947 and 1952, the name of the Polish state was the Republic of Poland (\\"Rzeczpospolita Polska\\"), in accordance with the temporary Constitution of 1947. At the time of its founding during final stages of World War II, Poland was regarded as a puppet entity set up and controlled by the Soviet Union, and over time, it developed into a satellite state of the Soviet Union. - Institute of High Pressure Physics , also known as Unipress ( Polish : Instytut Wysokich Cinie ) is a scientific institute founded in 1972 by the Polish Academy of Sciences ( PAN ) . - A research institute is an establishment endowed for doing research.

It is responsible for spearheading the development of science across the country by a society of distinguished scholars as well as a network of research institutes. It was established in 1951, during the early period of the Polish People's Republic following World War II. - An academy of sciences is a type of learned society or academy (as special scientific institution) dedicated to sciences that could be or not state funded.

Answer the following question: Information: - Wang Mang (c. 45 6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos. - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator ( ) of Changsha ( ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders . - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved. - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han. - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty. - Cao Cao (155 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals. - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history. - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang. - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han founded by Liu Bei in 221 in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. - Liu Bei (161 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu. - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class. - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong.

What is the answer for the question: What is the present-day name of the islands that were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris? from the following article ? The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\"","completion":"The article refers to the islands that were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris as \\"St Kilda\\". The initial mention of \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\" and subsequent references to \\"Hirta\\" suggest that this is the basis for the current name. The justification for this answer is that the user asked for the present-day name of the islands. In the supplied article, the islands under the MacLeods' dominion were first mentioned as \\"the islands that are called Hirtir.\\" However, the repeated mentions of St Kilda throughout the passage, including references to the steward's collections and history, indicate that St Kilda is the recognized name for these islands today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Janet Van Ham/HBO via AP) (Associated Press) LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bill Maher's decision to book conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos on his HBO show drew quick condemnation from another guest. Jeremy Scahill, a journalist who's appeared frequently on \\"Real Time with Bill Maher,\\" posted on Twitter that he won't appear as a panelist Friday because of Yiannopoulos and what he represents. \\"He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes. There is no value in 'debating' him,\\" Scahill tweeted. Appearing on Maher's show will give Yiannopoulos a major platform for \\"his racist, anti-immigrant campaign,\\" wrote Scahill, co-founding editor of The Intercept news website. Scahill said he respects Maher's show as an arena for debate and discussion but called Yiannopoulos \\"many bridges too far.\\" HBO confirmed that Scahill had canceled. \\"If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims - and he might be - nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night,\\" Maher said in a statement released late Wednesday. In an email Wednesday to The Associated Press, Yiannopoulos said that \\"public shaming and grandstanding don't work any more. ... Thanks for proving my point for me, Jeremy Scahill! You can look forward to pulling out of a lot more shows in the next few decades.\\" Yiannopoulos writes for Breitbart News, considered by many a platform for the so-called \\"alt-right\\" movement, an offshoot of conservatism that mixes racism, white nationalism and populism. His Twitter account was suspended last year after a series of racially insensitive tweets aimed at \\"Ghostbusters\\" actress Leslie Jones, who is black. Yiannopoulos has denied he is a white nationalist or racist.

A frequent guest on Maher’s HBO show over the past several years, Scahill wrote, “Appearing on Real Time will provide Yiannopoulos with a large, important platform to openly advocate his racist, anti-immigrant campaign.

Translate to English","completion":"We need to carefully address this danger so that we do not help those who do not need help, and so that we do not leave those in need without assistance. This statement emphasizes the importance of thoroughly assessing the risks associated with providing assistance to individuals or groups in various situations. In order to ensure that help is given to the right people, it is crucial to have a detailed understanding of their needs, circumstances, and the potential consequences of offering aid. The primary goal of the speaker in this statement seems to be the equitable allocation of resources and support to ensure the overall well-being and fairness to all involved parties. Firstly, it is essential to recognize the potential harm that can result from offering help to those who do not actually need it. In some cases, providing assistance to individuals who are undeserving can lead to a sense of entitlement and reinforce negative habits or behaviors, such as dependency or lack of initiative. This can then generate a situation in which these individuals may rely more and more on external support rather than developing their skills and capacities. Additionally, the allocation of resources to those who do not need them can lead to a scarcity of available support for those who genuinely need assistance. To avoid this, it is crucial to develop a well-defined set of criteria and guidelines for identifying those who are in genuine need of help. This could include determining the severity of their situation, the level of vulnerability they face, and any existing coping mechanisms they may have. By thoroughly analyzing these factors, it becomes possible to allocate assistance to those who truly require it while avoiding the potential hazards of inadvertently reinforcing negative behaviors in those who do not. On the other hand, we must also make sure not to neglect the needs of those who genuinely require assistance. This can happen when individuals or groups are overlooked or ignored, either due to their background, social status, or any other factors that may make their need for support less visible or evident. In such cases, it is crucial to establish methods for reaching out to these individuals, identifying their needs, and devising strategies for providing the appropriate help. In order to address this danger effectively, several steps should be taken: 1. Conduct thorough research and assessments to identify those who genuinely need help and understand the specific nature of their needs. 2. Develop clear criteria and guidelines for allocating assistance to ensure that it is provided to the most deserving and vulnerable individuals. 3. Invest in outreach programs and initiatives to identify individuals or groups who may be overlooked or marginalized and in need of support. 4. Develop mechanisms for continuous monitoring and evaluation of assistance programs, making sure that support is reaching the intended recipients and producing the desired impact. 5. Foster a culture of empathy and understanding, encouraging open communication and collaboration among different stakeholders and partners involved in providing help, so that the assistance offered is tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of each individual or group. In conclusion, addressing the potential dangers associated with providing assistance is a complex and sensitive issue. By acknowledging the risks and taking the necessary steps to mitigate them, it is possible to create an environment in which help is offered to those who genuinely need it while avoiding the pitfalls of accidentally reinforcing negative behaviors or overlooking those in genuine need of support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Write a summary based on this article: An unfinished Frida Kahlo painting whose whereabouts had remained a mystery for years has reappeared and is scheduled to be auctioned off next week in New York City. Niña Con Collar (Girl with Necklace) was painted by Kahlo in 1929, when the famous Mexican artist was just 22. It hadn’t been seen by the public for decades, but recently resurfaced in California, where it had been tucked away in someone’s house since the 1950s. Next week the painting will be auctioned at Sotheby’s for an estimated 1.5- 2 million. Not bad for one of Frida’s earliest works. Sothebys The auction house said the painting is expected to fetch such an eyebrow-raising price because Kahlo’s works have become extremely rare. For several decades the Mexican government has been protecting her paintings as national cultural patrimony. Export of her paintings is forbidden. But Niña con Collar is a different matter. The painting was reportedly given to a woman who worked with Kahlo in the 1950s. It was a gift from Kahlo’s husband, the iconic Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The woman, now in her 90s, took the painting with her to California, where it hung unnoticed in her private collection for 60 years. Axel Stein, Sotheby’s director for Latin American art, told Reuters the painting is in remarkably good shape. “It was in a dark part of the house so the colors are (still) vibrant,” he said. Kahlo’s “Two Nudes in the Forest” broke a record for Latin American artists last year, when the painting sold for 8 million at another auction. Art critics say the unfinished work of Niña Con Collar shows early traces of Kahlo’s world-renowned style. The subject in the painting faces the audience with Kahlo’s arched eyebrows, though it’s not believed to be a self-portrait. Sotheby’s auction house reports that Kahlo probably kept the painting until her death, in 1954, because she had an emotional attachment to it. “The painting would hold a particular meaning to her, as it became a point of departure on which she built various self-portraits over time,” Sotheby’s said in a release. “It is not unusual for an artist to keep a particular work, which she did…because it proved to be a spring well of ideas for works to come. “ ||||| The mere mention of Frida Kahlo makes our thinking stop, heads turn, and imagination take flight. Rightfully, she referred to herself as \\"the ancient concealer,\\" for endlessly we wonder who she truly was, who she might have been, or whom she represents. Although, each adorateur will believe him or herself to be the sole recipient of her truth and to know more intimately than anyone the secret of her essence, she remains an enigma. Mysterious Kahlo, always different, always the same, lives entrenched in our universal psyche. There is no turning back. We want the impossible: to know more, all and everything there is to know about this self-invented woman who gave birth to herself.It is unusual, an auspicious event, to be able to study one of Kahlo's early portraits and devote time to observing her creative process suspended in a moment of its unfolding. Thus, when one of her lost works comes to light, the opportunity to learn more about her feels like a garnered gift. Until recently, the whereabouts of Niña con collar was unknown. We first learned of its existence from a photograph of the painting in the archive of Lola Álvarez Bravo, who began photographing Kahlo's work about the time she married Rivera, three years before her signature style was established. The first time Niña con collar was documented was in Frida Kahlo: Das Gesamtwerk (1988), the catalogue raisonné of her complete work. At the time, we had the photo and no other information. But the photo was enough for us to feel fortunate. The Álvarez Bravo photographs of Kahlo's early works are invaluable documents for the scholar. They confirm the work's authenticity, and they also educate about early influences and the development of her style. Kahlo reworked at a later date some of these paintings, and we have photographs of various stages; yet other works are lost. Had it not been for Lola Álvarez Bravo, we would not know what many of these works looked like or even of their existence, and we would certainly have a lesser understanding of Kahlo's creative process.We can be certain that Kahlo left Niña con collar intentionally unfinished, for otherwise, she would not have wanted it photographed. The question we are left with is, how come? The thoughtful reply is to conclude that when she reached the desired emotional content in the work she stopped for fear of losing what she had, which could have happened had she continued work on it. That she did not wish to risk. Furthermore, the painting would hold a particular meaning to her, as it became a point of departure on which she built various self-portraits over time. It is not unusual for an artist to keep a particular work, which she did until she gave it to the current owner, because it proved to be a spring well of ideas for works to come. Kahlo recalled to a friend the history of these early portraits: I began to paint after the accident...I was studying at the Prepa, but the accident messed me up. I returned to school, but I felt very sore and had little strength. I took my paintings to Diego, and he liked them a lot... Then, the friendship and almost courtship with Diego began. I would go to see him paint in the afternoon, and afterward he would take me home by bus or in a Fordcito-a little Ford that he had-and he would kiss me. One Sunday, Diego came to the house to see my paintings and critiqued all of them in a very clear manner, and he told me all the possibilities he saw in them. Then I painted two or three things, which are around the house, that to me seem very influenced by him. They are portraits of thirteen- or fourteen-year old kids. Why does the Niña con collar seem familiar to us, as if we had seen it before, although it is essentially unknown? Clearly it brings to mind Kahlo as she portrayed herself in the marriage portrait produced in 1931 (fig. 1). Though slightly modified, all the elements are there, beginning with the frontal pose, and followed by the winged eyebrows, the hoop earrings, and the jade bead necklace. Kahlo simply reversed the colors of the dress and the rebozo. It also brings to mind what she wore to her unpretentious marriage to Rivera in the court of Coyoacán: \\"I asked the maid for skirts, the blouse and rebozo were also borrowed from the maid.\\" Niña con collar fits Kahlo's description of those early paintings and foretells and closely resembles her in the well-known marriage portrait produced two years later. Despite Kahlo's claim of Rivera's influence, a detailed study of the bust-length Niña confirms it is all Kahlo. Set against a brilliant indigo wall, a Mexican girl poses in a rustic pine chair. For her portrait, the girl has made herself look her best, with hair parted in the middle, pulled back, and carefully coiffed with spit curls around her forehead. To confront the viewer, Kahlo uses the girl's direct stare from under her spreading monobrow and the rigid symmetry of a frontal pose, as opposed to the conventional three-quarters view - rare for a secular portrait but not uncommon for Kahlo. Kahlo's reduction of the space around the girl brings her immediately to the forefront and grabs our attention as she does in the 1929 Self Portrait, Time Flies (fig. 2) or even more so, in the Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird, 1940 (fig. 3). Kahlo's merging of the girl's dark eyes and black pupils serves to highlight her gaze. The jade beads around her neck and hoop earrings complement her festive bright red dress and a deep green rebozo. Suggestions of her nascent sensuality imbue the image. Her discreetly low cut dress shows her as a girl in early adolescence. Yet, she is still a child. Her rebozo falls naturally from her right shoulder, contrasting with the left, where it is slightly pulled aside. The girl's lips are sealed in a pout, but her vacant look beckons, making the viewer wonder what is passing through her mind. This is a thought never far from the viewer's mind, when studying a Kahlo self portrait. Niña con collar is the seed of many self portraits that Kahlo will produce thereafter in her signature style. Salomon Grimberg Dallas, Texas September 28, 2016 ||||| It all started with a black-and-white photograph of a painting. Lola Álvarez Bravo, a photographer who captured the painter’s early works, took an image of Frida Kahlo‘s self-portrait Niña con collar (Girl with Necklace). The 1929 oil-on-canvas ended up a part of the artist’s catalogue raisonné, but little was known about the origins of the work. Decades later, according to Sotheby’s, which is offering it in its November 22 Latin America: Modern Art sale, its whereabouts remained unknown. In 1955, the year following the artist’s death, Kahlo’s husband Diego Rivera gifted the painting to a woman who had assisted his late wife in her studio, according to Reuters. Since then, Niña con collar has maintained a lengthy absence from the public eye, hanging inside a home in Sunnyvale, California. The well-preserved work now approaches its sale date with an estimate of 1.5–2 million. The elusive work features a seated woman wearing a striking orange shirt and green shawl, complemented by gold hoop earrings and a beaded necklace. It is a “beautiful and warm painting,” says Axel Stein, the head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s, in a statement. Although it lacks the spatial depth and adornment present in her later works, this rediscovered painting is an evident precursor to Kahlo’s better known portraits, which depict compelling, serious women and girls with direct gazes. Kahlo’s enigmatic canvas will go on public view in New York starting Saturday, November 19. Follow artnet News on Facebook: ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Frida Kahlo painting that has never been publicly exhibited and whose whereabouts had been a mystery will be auctioned next week at Sotheby’s in New York, the auction house said on Monday. A man hangs a sign as artist Frida Kahlo's painting 'Nina Con Collar' sits on an easel at Sotheby's auction house in New York U.S., November 14, 2016. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton “Nina con Collar,” (Girl with Necklace), a 1929 oil on canvas, will go on the auction block on Nov. 22 at Sotheby’s Latin American sale with an estimated value of 1.5 million to 2 million. “This hung in a California home for 60 years,” said Axel Stein, head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s. “The painting looks very fresh. It was in a dark part of the house so the colors are vibrant.” Kahlo died at age 47 in 1954. The following year, her widower, the muralist Diego Rivera, gave the painting to a woman who had helped Kahlo in the studio, Stein said. The recipient took the work home to California. Now in her mid-90s, she offered it to Sotheby’s this summer, he said. The auction house declined to comment on why the owner sought to sell the piece. “Nina con Collar” is among the first 20 of Kahlo’s 143 paintings, Stein said. It prefigures hallmarks of the artist’s self-portraits, including winged eyebrows and the full frontal gaze. The subject, a girl of about 13 or 14, stares directly at the viewer. “There is a sense of warmth and closeness,” Stein said. As in some Kahlo self-portraits, there is little depth. The background is a mix of indigo and sky-blue; the face of the girl is copper-brown. She wears a jade necklace that appears in other paintings by the artist. In international art markets, works by Kahlo have fetched more than any other Latin American artist, said Stein. Last May, Christie’s sold a 1939 Kahlo painting for 8 million, an auction record for her work. Sotheby’s has privately sold individual Kahlo works for more than 15 million each, said Dan Abernethy, an auction house spokesman. One reason Kahlo works are so valued in the international market is that Mexico for several decades has barred their export to conserve the country’s cultural heritage under national patrimony laws, Stein said. |||||","completion":"A previously unknown painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York City for an estimated 1.5m-2m.

Write an article based on this summary: – As part of his recent bid to appeal to women, Mitt Romney deployed what he called an \\"amazing statistic,\\" saying that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" If that made your eyebrows climb your forehead, you're not alone. The AP's fact checkers looked into the statement, and found that while it's technically true, it's also truly misleading. The recession began 13 months before Obama took office, and it initially hit men disproportionately hard. Male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing are often hit first in recessions, and that was especially true this time. When Obama took office, women-dominated industries were catching up, and the number of unemployed women grew by 858,000 after January 2009—the basis of Romney's stat. But overall, men have lost 3.4 million jobs during the recession, to 1.8 million for women—which is why some economists have dubbed it the \\"man-cession.\\" CNN also notes that women began losing jobs in March 2008, well before Obama's inauguration.","completion":"Title: Mitt Romney's \\"Amazing Statistic\\" on Job Losses Among Women: Unraveling the Facts Introduction During his political campaign, Mitt Romney made a striking claim in an attempt to appeal to women voters. He stated that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" While this statistic may have initially alarmed many people, further investigation highlights that this statement is not only misleading but also obscures the broader context of the recession and its impact on employment. Fact-checking Romney's Statistic According to an investigation by Associated Press (AP) fact-checkers, Romney's claim is technically true. However, it is vital to delve deeper into the origins and implications of this statement to fully understand the political rhetoric in play. Firstly, the recession, which would later be followed by massive job losses, began 13 months before President Obama took office. As a direct result of the recession, male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing were disproportionately affected. This is typical of most recessions, as these industries are often the first to be hit by economic downturns. Therefore, it is important to consider that these mass job losses for men occurred before Obama's presidency. Secondly, when President Obama assumed office, female-dominated industries started to \\"catch up\\" in terms of job losses. Unemployed women increased by 858,000 after January 2009, which forms the basis of Romney's statement. However, it is crucial to consider the overall picture when examining the impact of the recession on jobs. Men lost around 3.4 million jobs during this period, compared to women who lost about 1.8 million jobs. Consequently, some economists have referred to this phenomenon as the \\"man-cession.\\" Additionally, CNN reported that women started losing jobs in March 2008, months before President Obama was inaugurated. Therefore, attributing these job losses solely to Obama's administration is inherently misleading. Conclusion While Mitt Romney's \\"amazing statistic\\" may hold some truth to it, the overall context and factual basis behind the statement must be examined to evaluate its real meaning. The recession and its subsequent job losses had a profound impact on both men and women, yet pinning the losses exclusively to a particular administration is an oversimplification of the complicated nature of economic crises. In the case of Romney's statement, attributing the high percentage of job losses among women during the Obama years is not only misleading, but it also disregards the broader context of recessionary job losses in male-dominated industries, the timeline of when these losses occurred, and the overall effects of the recession. As such, it is essential to remain vigilant and conscious of political rhetoric, especially when considering the impact of economic crises on society as a whole."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Q: What is the name of the \\"point\\" that refers to the temperature at which water vapor condenses?

So I quitted my job as a babysitter and then schooled my daughter heart and soul at home. A year ago a boy of 14 befriended my daughter on Facebook after reading something Alisa wrote about bullying. Today he messaged her and asked if she would like six tickets to a Colorado Rockies baseball game. They have never met in person but she said, \\"Sure! That would be great.\\" Then I received a call from his mother explaining why her son had chosen my daughter. She said he thought my daughter deserved them because of all the good she does in the community. Her son, she explained, had experienced a similar situation and was also home schooled. What she said is true. Now my daughter Alisa continues to teach groups of girls in trouble in our community how to look within themselves for the positive and how to be their own person. Everything taken into consideration, we decided to meet the mother and the boy at a local bike shop. After meeting, the boy approached my car and my daughter gave him a hug and thanked him for his generosity. She told him that she had never been to a baseball game and that she was going to take her entire family, including myself, her dad, little sister, her cousin and an aunt who has brain cancer. We all thanked one another, got in our car, and went our way. As we drove home my daughter opened the envelope. Inside it were the tickets and 100 each to buy hot dogs, pay for parking and not have any worries but a great time.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overthrew the Monégasque constitution? , can you please find it? Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

The once-promising actor spent over a decade clawing his way back to the heights he had once achieved, after destroying his own career with self-destructive behavior. Rourke's journey is a testament to the power of self-reflection, accepting responsibility, and embracing change. Step 1: Provide context on Mickey Rourke Mickey Rourke was a rising star in the late '80s, charming audiences and critics alike with his defiant attitude and raw talent. He appeared in a range of films, from romantic dramas like \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" to crime thrillers like \\"Angel Heart.\\" Rourke seemed destined for greatness, but at the peak of his career, he inexplicably threw it all away. Step 2: Detail Rourke's self-destructive behavior At the height of his stardom, Rourke succumbed to a slew of self-destructive habits, including alcoholism, drug abuse, and aggressive behavior. This period coincided with a string of critical and commercial disappointments, which pushed him further to the edges of relevance within the film industry. Eventually, Rourke lost faith in himself, and his career plummeted to rock bottom. Step 3: Discuss Rourke's self-reflection and taking responsibility Despite the myriad challenges and setbacks he faced, one constant remained in Rourke's life: his willingness to take responsibility for his own actions. In his own words, \\"You've got to look in the mirror and go 'It's your fault'\\". This self-awareness was the first step in his long journey towards regaining his place in the limelight. Step 4: Describe Rourke's therapy and growth To overcome the personal demons that had sabotaged his career, Rourke sought help through therapy. For 13 years, he attended sessions, slowly chipping away at the fears and destructive patterns that had ensnared him. One of his most significant revelations was that he had been \\"afraid of change\\" - the same change that was now essential for his personal growth and career revival. Step 5: Highlight Rourke's comeback By the mid-2000s, Rourke showed signs of an improbable comeback, ultimately solidified by his role in the 2008 film \\"The Wrestler.\\" His heart-wrenching portrayal of a washed-up wrestler resonated with audiences around the world, earning him a Golden Globe award and an Oscar nomination. The industry's prodigal son had finally returned, showcasing his raw talent and tireless perseverance. Conclusion: Mickey Rourke's story is one of resilience, self-reflection, and the power of personal growth. After losing everything and being dismissed as a relic of the past, Rourke defied all expectations by rebuilding his career on the foundations of responsibility, acceptance, and change. Through his determination and commitment to therapy, he demonstrated that the road to redemption is never impossible, no matter how far one has fallen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he walks nearer to the camera and we see his face in closeup, we hear the words \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" He is the narrator (Richard Basehart), a young man who has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided to see a different world by signing on to a whaling ship. By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships, townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor, Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod, a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano), and he makes a prophecy, that the day you smell land where there... My question: Why does the captain abandon his search? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Captain Ahab abandons his search for Moby Dick due to a culmination of factors that force him to reevaluate his obsession with the great white whale and the implications it has had on his crew, himself, and the overall mission of the whaling ship. Firstly, the immense loss of life and destruction caused by Moby Dick begins to weigh on Captain Ahab's conscience. As the journey progresses, many crew members are killed or injured during their encounters with the whale, which ultimately results in the sinking of the Pequod. The growing sense of guilt and responsibility for these losses forces Captain Ahab to question the true value of his revenge-driven quest. Additionally, Ahab begins to recognize the negative impact that his obsession with Moby Dick has had on his relationships with his crew, particularly Ishmael and Starbuck, the first mate. Ishmael's friendship with Queequeg and his own inquisitive nature serve as reminders that there is more to life than the single-minded pursuit of revenge, while Starbuck's continued concern for the welfare of the crew and the ship highlights the moral and practical implications of Ahab's preoccupation. Furthermore, Captain Ahab experiences moments of self-doubt and introspection during the course of the journey, leading him to question the validity of his vendetta against Moby Dick. These introspective moments make him reflect on the nature of fate, free will, and his own role in the escalating cycle of violence between himself and the whale. Lastly, external factors beyond Ahab's control may also contribute to his decision to abandon his search. Encountering other whaling ships that have either been destroyed by Moby Dick or are themselves hunting the whale, along with the increasing scarcity of whales in general, foreshadow the unsustainability and ultimate futility of Ahab's quest. These factors may lead him to reconsider his priorities and accept that pursuing Moby Dick at any cost is no longer a feasible or justifiable objective. In conclusion, Captain Ahab abandons his search for Moby Dick due to a combination of personal introspection, guilt over the loss of numerous crew members, the strain that his obsession has placed on his relationships, and various external factors that emphasize the unsustainability and impracticality of his vengeance-fueled pursuit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That' s why I haven' t written for such a long time. Since the beginning of this year we' ve been doing a project called ' World Class'. Have you heard of it.'? Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school' in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister. She's tried to teach me some of her language and it' s really difficult. I love it because it' s the first time I' ve thought about what life must be like somewhere else. I can' t believe people miss classes here when everything is so easy for us. I think more people should help out with projects like this.

Legion (David Charles Haller) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. When Mystique tracked down David years later to get revenge for \\"his\\" murder of Destiny, he awakened with his fractured mind healed. David had a new goal, to help his father realize his dream of human-mutant coexistence by killing Magneto, Xavier's greatest opponent, before he had a chance to amass power. He traveled twenty years into the past, when Xavier and Magneto were orderlies at the mental hospital. In the process, he loses his memory. Magneto then accidentally triggers his memory, causing David to go on a rampage, attacking Magneto and revealing the existence of mutants to the public decades too early. Several X-Men who were pulled back in time with him were unable to prevent him from attacking Magneto. Xavier, however, leaped into the path of the psi-knife (the focused totality of Legion's psionic powers) and was killed in Magneto's place, causing the formation of the Age of Apocalypse timeline. Due to being trapped in the past by David's actions, Bishop enlisted the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to confront Legion again. Bishop seized Legion's psi-blade and drove it into his own chest, allowing Legion to see the future that he caused. In his last moments, David apologized for what he did.

They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge.

Geologists usually study geology, although backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences are also useful. Field work is an important component of geology, although many subdisciplines incorporate laboratory work. - Otto Martin Torell ( 1828 -- 1900 ) was a Swedish naturalist and geologist . He was born in Varberg , Sweden on 5 June 1828 . He was educated at Lund University for the medical profession , but became interested in zoological and geological studies , and being of independent means he devoted himself to science . He gave his attention first especially to the invertebrate fauna and the physical changes of pleistocene and recent times . In 1850 he applied Louis Agassiz 's theory on ice ages to explain his observations of arctic molluscs on the coast of Sweden . From 1856 to 1859 he studied the glacial phenomena of Switzerland , Iceland , Spitzbergen and Greenland , and in 1861 made the first of two Arctic expeditions to the Polar sea in company with Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld . In 1865 he visited the Netherlands to investigate the strange rock formations and to explore the possibility of answering the prize contest set up by the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen since 1841 with the theme \`\` What is to be thought of Agassiz 's discovery that glacial moraines occur in Northern Europe far from present glaciers ? '' . Since 1861 the question was broadend to include the question where the hondsrug rocks came from , and in 1867 Torell sent in a proposal to declare the rocks were transported by glaciers and was awarded the prize ( a gold medal worth 400 guilders and cash to the amount of 150 guilders ) but he never collected it , to the great frustration of the Haarlem Society 's secretary , who sent him letters requesting his manuscript for publication . The 300 page manuscript was finally sent after Torell 's death by the Swedish Geological survey , of which he had become director . His widow was awarded the prize posthumously . In 1866 , he became professor of zoology and geology in the University of Lund , and in 1871 he was appointed chief of the Geological Survey of Sweden . In the latter capacity he labored until 1897 . His published contributions , though of much interest and importance , were not large ,... - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard.

How to get rid of skin moles Determine the type of mole in order to assess your treatment options. While you may use natural methods to remove moles for cosmetic reasons, you will need to see a doctor for cancerous moles. If you have several moles and one looks different from the others, you should get it evaluated by a doctor.","completion":"The most logical next event after determining the type of mole and assessing your treatment options is to decide on the best approach to remove the mole. This process should consider the type of mole, its location on the skin, and your personal preferences. Remember that it's crucial to see a physician if there's any concern about the mole being cancerous or showing signs of dysplasia. Here are several methods for mole removal, both natural and medical: 1. Natural Home Remedies Before attempting natural remedies, consult your healthcare provider as they may not be suitable for all skin types or all mole conditions. - Apple Cider Vinegar: Apply apple cider vinegar directly to the mole using a cotton ball, and cover it with a bandage. Leave it on for a few hours and repeat the process daily until the mole scabs and falls off. - Garlic: Garlic is believed to have enzymes that break down the cell clusters of moles. Apply crushed garlic directly to the mole, cover it with a bandage, and leave it on overnight. Repeat the process daily for improved results. - Tea Tree Oil: Apply a drop of tea tree oil directly to the mole, and cover it with a bandage. Repeat the process twice daily for several weeks for the mole to disappear. Remember that results may vary with home remedies, and they might not be effective for everyone. Patience and consistency are key when using natural treatments. 2. Over-the-counter Treatments These treatments contain acids that can help remove moles, but consult your healthcare provider before starting any over-the-counter treatment. - Mole Removal Creams: Follow the instructions on the packaging, as each product varies in its application. - Salicylic Acid: Apply salicylic acid solutions or pads to the affected area daily. The acid helps to peel off layers of the mole gradually. 3. Medical Procedures - Surgical Excision: A physician will numb the area and surgically remove the mole with a scalpel. They may also remove some healthy tissue surrounding the mole to ensure complete removal of potentially cancerous cells. - Laser Removal: Laser mole removal is an effective method for flat and small moles. The process involves using laser light to break down melanin pigment, which forms the mole. Multiple sessions can be required. - Cryotherapy: A physician will use liquid nitrogen to freeze the mole, which will cause the mole to form a scab and eventually fall off. The process might need to be repeated for a complete removal. - Electrocautery: This treatment involves using an electrical current to cut, remove or burn the mole tissue without bleeding. This method can have minimal scarring. Your course of action will depend on the type of mole, its potential risks, and your personal preferences. Medical professionals can help you choose the most appropriate method, based on factors such as scarring, mole depth, and location. Always consult your healthcare provider before taking any measures to remove skin moles."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

He works at his family's auto shop, which has been struggling financially for years. Despite its financial troubles, Zach's family finds solace in the fact that they have each other. Step 2: Introduce Frankie and their connection to Zach Frankie is Zach's eccentric childhood friend, who moved away years ago and found success in the criminal underworld. Known for their cunning and charm, Frankie is a notorious gang leader, and their criminal empire spans across several cities. Step 3: Show the inciting incident Zach's family's financial situation worsens when his father falls ill and the medical bills begin piling up. Desperate, Zach secretly indulges in shady side jobs to make ends meet. During one of these jobs, he unexpectedly crosses paths with Frankie.

Step 4: The offer and Zach's decline Sensing Zach's desperation, Frankie offers him a way out of his troubles: join Frankie's gang, leave the town, and start a new, exciting life in the criminal underworld.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: In order to attract talent scouts and to get recruited onto a team, you’ll need an act to attract the right person. Whether you’re practicing with your brother in the backyard or with your coach at a first-class gym, keep practicing. It should be something you can practically do in your sleep, where you know you won’t hurt yourself and mistakes aren’t common. You want it perfect so when you're called up, you can audition or be a substitute on a second's notice. When you get the circus they may change it as they see fit, but it has to get you there in the first place. To apply for worldwide gigs (like Cirque du Soleil), you’ll probably need to make an audition tape, showing your skills. Bigger companies often have online submission forms that you can submit during certain times of year. Showcase the best of your act, follow the appropriate guidelines, and make sure your tape is as professional-looking as possible. Many circus acts have agents and work through recruiters, too. The more time you spend in the field, the more networked you'll be, making it easier to make and find connections. Though they don’t get a lot of press, there are legitimate, credible circus schools out there that are looking for students to teach with skills they can help hone. If there’s one in your area (or even if there’s not), look into it – it’s a great way to meet people that are already established in the field. There’s a great job outlook, too. Most schools tout one of their biggest selling points as placing 100% (or nearly 100%) of their graduates in jobs. Most people don’t start out playing with the big boys – they do small gigs and then get noticed, breaking in through making a name for themselves. To do this, take whatever opportunities you can. Your high school talent show, your dad’s business luncheon, or the halftime show at a local football game. if you build up your resume, more people will look at your act and take it seriously. Tell your friends and family members to talk to their friends and family members about your act. You may get booked into private parties and local events just by word of mouth. This is one of the most reliable ways to market yourself and it can spread like wildfire. In addition to small, one-off gigs like private parties, think of less traditional semi-related gigs like on cruise ships. You work in a show put together by the cruise line for 6-9 months and then that’s that. This is a great stepping stone to getting to one of the bigger, official circuses around. Consider websites like Workaway, too, where you can sign up for a period of time and be part of the circus in exchange for room and board. It’s not glamorous, but it’s a step in the right direction! Yep, those are a thing. The American Youth Circus Organization holds the Youth Circus Festival every year in August, just as one example. Some people are asked to perform and others get lucky enough to nab a slot – but either way, you’ll be able to showcase your stuff and get seen. Apply as early as you can, talk to your coach, agent, or recruiter, and get your name in the ring. It may, at least initially, cost you money for travel and what not, but it's a small sacrifice to make to be showcased. Now that you’ve built up your resume and have an act you can rely on, go for the big leagues. Apply to the next variation of Cirque du Soleil or Barnum & Bailey’s and get ready for the life of a circus performer. Can you believe you made it happen? Sometimes you'll apply and won't hear for months. If you don't hear back automatically, don't give up hope, but keep applying elsewhere. Don't shy away from international gigs, too. The one brutal fact that most circus hopefuls don't really think about is the fact that they'll be away from home, constantly living out of a suitcase. Life onstage will be glamorous, but life offstage means hotels, vending machines, and sleeping in cars. Some people find this life rewarding, but others find it very challenging. To make it, you've gotta be the kind that thrives in this setting. It can be very lonely, too. You'll develop a circus family definitely, but your real family may even be thousands of miles away. This, of course, depends on your contract. Only sign up for a period of time you know you can handle.","completion":"To attract talent scouts and get recruited, you need a well-practiced act. Applying for worldwide gigs often requires an audition tape, which should be professional-looking. Networking is key, and attending circus schools can help hone your skills and create connections. Gain experience by performing at various events, marketing yourself through word of mouth, and working on cruise ships or through websites like Workaway. Participating in festivals like Youth Circus Festival can provide additional exposure. Once your resume is strong, apply for bigger opportunities like Cirque du Soleil or Barnum & Bailey's. Keep applying if you don't hear back, and don't shy away from international gigs.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them.

Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton.

Input: Passage: John, the eldest son of King Manuel I to his second wife Maria of Aragon, was born in Lisbon on 7 June 1502. The event was marked by the presentation of Gil Vicente's Visitation Play or the Monologue of the Cowherd in the queen's chamber. The young prince was sworn heir to the throne in 1503, the year his youngest sister, Isabella of Portugal, Empress Consort of the Holy Roman Empire between 1527 and 1538, was born. John was educated by notable scholars of the time, including the astrologer Tomás de Torres, Diogo de Ortiz, Bishop of Viseu, and Luís Teixeira Lobo, one of the first Portuguese Renaissance humanists, rector of the University of Siena and Professor of Law at Ferrara . John's chronicler António de Castilho said that, \\"Dom João III faced problems easily, complementing his lack of culture with a practice formation that he always showed during his reign\\" . In 1514, he was given his own house, and a few years later began to help his father in administrative duties. At the age of sixteen, John was chosen to marry his first cousin, the 20-year-old Eleanor of Austria, eldest daughter of Philip the Handsome of Austria-Burgundy and Queen Joanna of Castile, but instead she married his widowed father Manuel. John took deep offence at this: his chroniclers say he became melancholic and was never quite the same. Some historians also claim this was one of the main reasons that John later became fervently religious, giving him name the Pious .

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported.

Hypothesis: A mother and her two kids with balloons have just come from the circus. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true even if the premise is true. While the presence of the two children holding balloons and a woman on the sidewalk may suggest a connection to the circus, we do not have enough information to confidently state and prove that the woman is their mother or if they have truly just come from the circus. There could be several alternative explanations for the scene, such as the woman being their babysitter, a relative, or another family friend who accompanied the children to a different event, like a fair or a birthday party. The balloons could also have been purchased at a store or received as a gift, rather than being acquired at a circus. In summary, while the hypothesis may seem plausible given the premise, we do not have enough evidence to conclusively confirm its truth. To validate the hypothesis, we would need additional information or evidence about the relationship between the woman and children and about their specific whereabouts before the scene took place. Additionally, discerning the context of the premise would help with understanding if there were any other events or scenarios that could have led to this particular scene, finding alternative explanations, and ultimately verifying or disputing the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"tectonic plates. The ground shakes as a result of the movement of tectonic plates. These plates are large pieces of the Earth's lithosphere that fit together like a puzzle, comprising both the crust and a part of the upper mantle. The Earth's surface is divided into seven major and several minor tectonic plates, which rest on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is primarily caused by the forces generated from the release of energy within the Earth's mantle, which results in the process of plate tectonics. The forces driving the movement of these plates are known as mantle convection currents. The upper mantle becomes heated due to the radioactive decay of isotopes, leading to a decrease in density and ultimately causing it to rise, while cooler, denser material sinks. Three main types of plate boundaries exist: convergent, divergent, and transform. As the plates move, they interact with each other at these boundaries, leading to various geological events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains. Convergent plate boundaries occur when two plates come together or \\"collide.\\" In this scenario, the denser plate (typically an oceanic plate) subducts beneath the lighter plate (continental plate), leading to the formation of trenches, mountain ranges, and volcanic activity. Examples of these boundaries include the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate (which formed the Himalayan Mountain Range) and the Pacific plate subducting beneath the South American plate (forming the Andes and the Pacific \\"Ring of Fire\\"). Divergent plate boundaries are formed when two plates move away from each other, which is frequently seen at the mid-ocean ridges where new crust material rises from the mantle to form new oceanic crust. This separation generates rift valleys and, if significant enough, can lead to the development of new ocean basins. An example of a divergent boundary is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North American and Eurasian plates are drifting apart. Finally, transform plate boundaries occur when two plates slide horizontally past each other, which can result in earthquakes. The most famous example of a transform plate boundary is the San Andreas Fault, where the Pacific plate and the North American plate are sliding past each other in opposite directions. In conclusion, the ground shakes as a result of the movement of tectonic plates due to the release of energy within the Earth's mantle and the forces generated by mantle convection currents. These movements result in various geological events, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

He played college football at the University of Pittsburgh. Hypothesis: Stanley Anthony Woods won many awards","completion":"Based on the context provided, we cannot definitively draw the hypothesis that Stanley Anthony Woods won many awards because the information given does not explicitly state any awards or accolades received by Woods during his football career. It is important to note that an individual's success in their career cannot always be measured by the number of awards they receive. However, to investigate further into Woods' achievements, let's consider his contributions and background in more detail. Stanley Anthony Woods' football journey starts with his college career at the University of Pittsburgh. While the context does not provide specifics about his performance or accomplishments at the university, it is safe to assume that Woods played at a high enough level to be drafted into the NFL, which is a significant achievement in its own right. Being able to attend and play for a known university like the University of Pittsburgh, already indicates his talent in football. Woods' professional career saw him play in the National Football League (NFL) as a linebacker and defensive end. He played for three prestigious teams: the Seattle Seahawks (from 1987 to 1992), the Los Angeles Rams, and the Washington Redskins. It is worth mentioning that playing for these high-profile teams and having a career that spans multiple years suggests that Woods was a valued player in the NFL. The context does not provide any specific records or statistics that would otherwise direct us to draw a hypothesis about his awards. As a result, further investigation would be necessary to confirm whether Stanley Anthony Woods did, in fact, win numerous awards during his football career. This may include looking into his college and professional football records, finding biographical data to obtain more context about his career, or analyzing the statistical data to gauge his impact and performance on the teams he represented. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively hypothesize that Stanley Anthony Woods won many awards. However, his football journey – from the University of Pittsburgh to playing for various prestigious NFL teams – does highlight the talent and dedication he demonstrated in his career. Further research would reveal if Woods' talent and dedication were recognized in the form of multiple awards and accolades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

London (CNN) -- Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is once again calling on the UK to hand back the Falkland Islands -- known in Argentina as Las Malvinas -- accusing Britain of blatant colonialism. In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, which was published in the British press, she says that Britain stripped the islands away from Argentina 180 years ago on Thursday's date: January 3.

The British government swiftly rejected the idea of negotiations, saying the","completion":"matter was non-negotiable and that the residents of the Falkland Islands had a clear desire to remain British. The dispute has remained a point of contention between the two nations ever since the end of the conflict when the UK retained control over the islands. In her letter, President Kirchner emphasizes Argentina's historical claim to the Falklands and argues that it is time for the UK to participate in peaceful negotiations in accordance with several United Nations resolutions. She points out that the present British control over the islands is a remnant of old colonialist policies and that it goes against the principle of territorial integrity. The Prime Minister's office, however, reiterates that the central issue is not historical events or colonialism, but rather the rights of the Falkland Islanders themselves. They argue that the inhabitants have a fundamental right to self-determination, as enshrined in the UN Charter. In response to the ongoing disagreement, a referendum was held in March 2013, in which the residents of the Falkland Islands voted overwhelmingly to remain a British Overseas Territory. 99.8% of the voters chose to maintain their current political status, with only three people voting against. The turnout for the referendum was an impressive 92%. With these results, it's clear that the majority of people living in the Falkland Islands wish to remain under British sovereignty. Consequently, the British government asserts that the referendum results should be respected and that the will of the Falkland Islanders must be the determining factor in any discussions regarding the islands' sovereignty. Argentina, on the other hand, has dismissed the referendum as a publicity stunt that lacks any legal standing. Prime Minister David Cameron has maintained a firm stance on the issue, stating that there will be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands without the consent of the people who live there. Tensions between both countries have periodically flared up over the years, with economic sanctions and military posturing complicating matters. In conclusion, the debate over the Falkland Islands has persisted for decades, often driven by nationalistic rhetoric and historical grievances. While attempts have been made to diplomatically resolve the conflict, the UK and Argentina remain at odds, with the UK vehemently defending the right of the Falkland Islanders to determine their own future. Despite President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's plea for diplomatic negotiations, it seems unlikely that there will be any change in the islands' status unless the Falkland Islanders themselves decide otherwise. As long as the islanders remain adamant in their desire to maintain British ties, negotiations between the UK and Argentina will likely remain at an impasse. Although the international community is aware of the longstanding dispute, it has largely refrained from intervening, recognizing the sensitivity of the situation. Ultimately, the key to resolving the Falkland Islands issue will necessitate a mutual understanding and respect for the wishes of the local population by both the UK and Argentina - until then, the ongoing dispute stands as a testament to the complexities of post-colonial relations and national identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - pain - carpal tunnel syndrome - letter - thirst - printed word The rationale to choose \\"pain\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Typing for a prolonged period can lead to various health issues, and one of the most prominent indicators that you need to take a break is \\"pain.\\" Among the choices provided, pain stands out as the most accurate answer due to several reasons, which are discussed below: 1. Direct indication of physical discomfort: Pain is a direct manifestation of physical distress in your body, indicating that something is not right. Continuous typing without taking a break puts strain on your hands, wrists, fingers, and even your neck and back. If you experience pain in any of these areas, it's a clear sign that you should stop and take a break to rest and rejuvenate before continuing. 2. Prevents exacerbation of injury: Ignoring the pain and continuing to type without taking breaks may lead to more severe and chronic injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, or repetitive strain injury. By acknowledging and acting on this sign, you can prevent the progression of these conditions. 3. Enhances posture and ergonomics: Experiencing pain while typing could also be a sign of poor posture or inadequate ergonomic setup. Taking a break allows you to assess and adjust your workstation for better posture and improved ergonomics, resulting in reduced pain and a more comfortable typing experience for the long term. 4. Improves mental well-being: Pain isn't restricted to physical discomfort. It could also be a warning of mental fatigue, strain, or stress that arises from long hours of typing. Recognizing this signal and taking a break can help relieve stress, refresh your mental focus, and enhance productivity. 5. Can be an early sign of health issues: In some cases, pain related to typing could serve as an early warning sign of a more serious condition, like arthritis, nerve disorders, or even heart issues (for example, hand or arm pain can sometimes be associated with heart problems). Taking note of and addressing this concern might facilitate early detection and management of such health issues. While the other choices might be indirectly relevant to typing-related issues—such as carpal tunnel syndrome as an outcome of ignoring pain, thirst as a reminder to stay hydrated while working, or printed words as a means to switch tasks—it is the manifestation of pain that most clearly signifies the need to take a break while typing for a long time."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the two people who collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, while recording Smitten? from the following article ?

He receives two shore passes for himself and his First Officer Axel Skold (Hay Petrie) to dine with Ashton and Ellis, but the passes (and Helvig's motorboat) are stolen by passengers Mrs. Sorensen (Valerie Hobson) and talent scout Mr. Pidgeon (Esmond Knight). From a cut-out newspaper train schedule, Andersen is able to figure out they are taking a train to London and catches up with them; but, when the train arrives in the blacked-out metropolis, he is only able to hold on to Sorensen. He invites her to dine at the restaurant of Skold's brother Erik (also Hay Petrie). Then she takes him to the home of her aunt, where they are captured by a Nazi spy ring led by Van Dyne (Raymond Lovell), a man Sorensen has already had unpleasant dealings with in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Van Dyne knows Sorensen and Pidgeon are British agents. Van Dyne finds a message hidden on one of Sorensen's cigarette papers, identifying her as \\"M47\\" and listing the names of neutral ships which two German vessels are traveling. He decides to replace one of the names with that of an American ship to cause trouble, the United States being neutral at this time. Sorensen and Andersen are tied up, but the captain manages to escape. He brings back reinforcements in the form of Erik Skold's staff and is able to free Sorensen and knock out Van Dyne. With everything cleared up, Andersen and Sorensen resume their sea voyage. My question: Who does Morrone relay his plans to?","completion":"Not answerable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Numerous Turkish NGOs in Kosovo gathered last month in Vushtrri to evaluate the plan prepared by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, which aimed to determine the province's status. A large number of Turkish non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Kosovo held a meeting in the town of Vushtrri last month. The main focus of the gathering was to discuss and evaluate the plan put forward by the United Nations (UN) Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari. Ahtisaari, a former President of Finland, prepared this comprehensive plan with the objective of establishing the definitive status of the Kosovo province. Kosovo has been the subject of political controversies and territorial disputes, particularly between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia. The province declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which led to several complications regarding its recognition as an independent country by the international community. Although over 100 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, have recognized Kosovo as an independent state, some nations, such as Russia and China, have not extended such recognition. Martti Ahtisaari's plan, known as the Ahtisaari Plan, was created to serve as a roadmap that would outline provisions, guidelines, and recommendations for resolving the issues surrounding Kosovo's status. The plan includes proposals on various aspects, including territorial adjustments, minority representation, and decentralization. As a neutral facilitator, Ahtisaari aimed to bring a fair and lasting solution to the region by mediating between the conflicting parties and striving for consensus on critical issues. The meeting of the Turkish NGOs in Vushtrri highlights the active and robust involvement of Turkish civil society organizations in the pursuit of stability and sustainable development in Kosovo. These NGOs aim to support Kosovo's political, social, and economic integration into the international community while respecting its unique cultural identity. It is also a testament to the long-standing bilateral ties between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Kosovo, whether through the exchange of diplomatic recognition, trade, investments, or the provision of humanitarian aid. In conclusion, the gathering of so many Turkish NGOs in Vushtrri to discuss the Ahtisaari Plan indicates their commitment to promoting peace and resolution in the region. Through this collective effort, these organizations hope to contribute to the strengthening of Kosovo's statehood and foster positive diplomatic relations between the disputing parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The shape of each face of a tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle. A tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four faces, and it is the simplest of all the Platonic solids. In a regular tetrahedron, all the faces are congruent triangles – that is, all the sides and angles within the triangles are equal. Specifically, each face is an equilateral triangle, which has three equal sides and three equal angles, with each angle measuring 60 degrees. To further explain, imagine taking four equilateral triangles and connecting their edges to form a three-dimensional figure. When you join these triangles together, meeting at a common point called the vertex, you will create a regular tetrahedron. Each of the four vertices connects three triangles, and each edge of the tetrahedron is shared by two triangles. In addition to its equilateral triangular faces, other qualities of a regular tetrahedron include: 1. All edges have the same length: Since each face is an equilateral triangle, all the edges of the tetrahedron are the same length. 2. It has six equal edges: There are a total of six edges in a tetrahedron, with each face contributing three of its sides. 3. It has four vertices: A tetrahedron consists of four vertices, where each vertex joins three different faces. 4. Angle between faces: The angle between any two faces of a regular tetrahedron is called the dihedral angle, and in the case of a regular tetrahedron, the dihedral angle is approximately 70.53 degrees. 5. Symmetry: A regular tetrahedron has tetrahedral symmetry, meaning that it remains unchanged under certain rotations and reflections. In conclusion, the shape of each face of a tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle, with equal sides and equal angles of 60 degrees. The tetrahedron is composed of four such triangular faces, six equal edges, and four vertices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Drawing is a universal language. It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it. In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\" When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw. So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing. The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper. The theme this year is InsideOutside--People, Structure( ) and Spaces, and other events planned include drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper. The Big Draw is not about turning the nation into artists, it is about helping people to acquire this universal language of communication.

However, the lifecycles of most living polychaetes, which are almost all marine animals, are unknown, and only about 25% of the 300+ species whose lifecycles are known follow this pattern. About 14% use a similar external fertilization but produce yolk-rich eggs, which reduce the time the larva needs to spend among the plankton, or eggs from which miniature adults emerge rather than larvae. The rest care for the fertilized eggs until they hatch – some by producing jelly-covered masses of eggs which they tend, some by attaching the eggs to their bodies and a few species by keeping the eggs within their bodies until they hatch. These species use a variety of methods for sperm transfer; for example, in some the females collect sperm released into the water, while in others the males have a penis that inject sperm into the female.

One night, Ken indulges Ray's desire to get out of their hotel room, and they explore the city. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray approaches ChloÃ«, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a fancy restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a couple and ends up knocking them unconscious. ChloÃ« takes Ray to her apartment, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik suddenly appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him, and fires the gun (which is loaded with blanks) in his face, blinding one of his eyes. ChloÃ« shamefully admits that she and Eirik occasionally rob tourists after she seduces them, insisting she'd told Eirik that Ray was not a target.

Unfortunately, the film swiftly spirals down from its seemingly strong premise into an unrelenting abyss of poor choices that leave the viewer frustrated and disillusioned. The story revolves around two friends, played by relatively well-known actors, who find themselves at a turning point in their careers. The premise holds some genuine potential to explore themes like friendship, loyalty, and ambition. However, the script's rampant clichés, inadequately fleshed-out characters, and complete lack of originality stifle that potential and reduce the film to nothing more than a tedious, predictable slog. As the strained friendship between the two leading characters deteriorates, they descend into a pattern of juvenile behavior that is not only cringe-worthy but also further alienates the audience. The director's inability to coax engaging or nuanced performances, even from a cast with proven talent, is truly an appalling disappointment. The visual aesthetics and pacing of Disappointing Duo are equally disheartening. The film suffers from an overuse of generic establishing shots, washed-out colors, and banal cinematography that do nothing to provide even a semblance of visual flair. The editing is jarring, with abrupt transitions that often leave the viewer puzzled and frequently disrupt the flow of the storytelling. Perhaps the most distressing aspect of this film, however, is its blatant ignorance of any potential negative consequences to the characters' impulsive and reckless actions. The plot rapidly escalates to become a complete farce that undermines the seriousness of the initial conflict and ultimately trivializes the essential themes intended for exploration. All in all, Disappointing Duo was a bitter letdown. Bereft of any meaningful character development, lacking a compelling narrative core, and marred by an unappealing visual style, it squanders any potential it had. As the credits roll, it is difficult to remember a single redeeming quality from this misfire of a film.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. suppose more alcohol is consumed and turned into waste happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"When more alcohol is consumed and turned into waste, it will have a direct impact on the liver by making it work harder. This direct impact can lead to perturbation in the liver's functioning, which in turn can affect the overall health of an individual. Alcohol is broken down by the liver into a toxic substance called acetaldehyde, which is then further metabolized into harmless compounds like acetate and carbon dioxide. The liver is responsible for removing these toxins from the blood, along with its other vital functions such as processing nutrients and producing bile. However, the liver can process a limited amount of alcohol at a time. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause a backlog in the processing of alcohol and its toxins, forcing the liver to work harder and impacting the efficiency of its functions. The following are the ways in which alcohol-induced perturbation directly impacts the steps of the liver's detoxification process: 1. Overburdening the liver: The liver is responsible for breaking down alcohol into less harmful substances. Consuming more alcohol than the liver can handle puts excessive strain on the organ, affecting its ability to perform other important tasks such as processing nutrients and producing bile. 2. Impairing nutrient absorption: Excessive alcohol intake can damage the liver cells, which are essential for nutrient absorption. This damage can disrupt the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, directly impacting the liver's ability to process and distribute essential vitamins and minerals to other parts of the body. 3. Disrupting bile production: Alcohol consumption can lead to a decrease in bile production, affecting the liver's ability to break down and absorb fats. This can lead to fat accumulation in the liver, leading to fatty liver disease. Moreover, a deficiency in bile can also hinder the removal of waste products from the body, which can build up and lead to further liver damage. 4. Increased demand for glycogen reserves: As the body tries to process excessive alcohol, it may rely more on its glycogen stores for energy. This can deplete the liver's glycogen reserves, impacting the ability of the liver to manage blood sugar levels effectively. 5. Formation of toxic byproducts: The metabolism of alcohol produces toxic byproducts, such as reactive oxygen species, that can cause oxidative stress and damage the liver cells. This can directly impact the liver's ability to function effectively, further disrupting the various metabolic processes carried out by the liver. In conclusion, excessive alcohol consumption can directly impact multiple steps of the liver detoxification process, making the liver work harder to perform its vital functions. This can lead to liver damage or diseases over time, highlighting the importance of moderate and responsible alcohol consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). and the situation: There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost. Answer the following question: Which team had more people with muscle injuries? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is most likely that the Red team had more people with muscle injuries. The Red team arrived late and almost skipped the warm-up entirely, which did not give their muscles and tendons enough time to increase blood flow and prepare themselves for the exertion of playing soccer. In contrast, the Blue team arrived early, warmed up properly, and were ready for the game, leading to a decreased likelihood of injuries. Warming up before engaging in any physical activity, especially sports like soccer, helps in reducing the risk of muscle pulls, strains, and other injuries. It also enhances performance by increasing the flexibility and coordination of muscles, improving blood circulation, and preparing the cardiovascular system. The fact that the Red team lost the game can also be attributed to their lack of proper warm-up. When the body is not adequately prepared for physical activity, it can lead to reduced performance, slower reaction times, decreased strength, and a higher risk of injuries. It can also affect the overall morale and teamwork of the players. In this specific situation, the Red team's decision not to warm up properly likely cost them not just in terms of increased muscle injuries but also the outcome of the soccer match."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If \\"A man looking out of green binoculars.\\", can we conclude \\"A man watching a woman with binoculars\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A man looking out of green binoculars\\" offers limited information and could be interpreted in various ways. It is possible that the man is observing the surrounding environment, a distant event, an object, or even a person such as a woman. However, without further context, we cannot assert anything beyond the simple fact that he is using binoculars to look at something or someone. Given the information available, our conclusion \\"A man watching a woman with binoculars\\" is speculative and not directly supported by the original statement. We can only confirm the man's use of binoculars and not the specific object or person he is observing. The statement requires additional clarification and context to support or refute the suggestion that he is watching a woman. Moreover, it is essential to understand that interpretations and conclusions may vary depending on the observer's perspective, the surrounding context, and any implicit or explicit assumptions made by an individual. For a more accurate understanding, it is crucial to gather more information about the situation or context in which the man uses the green binoculars. For example, additional context could provide information about the man's location, purpose, or focus. Perhaps he is using binoculars for birdwatching in a natural setting or spectating at a sports event, in which case the proposed conclusion would be unlikely. Alternatively, the statement could be a snippet from a story in which the man's actions are tied to a particular narrative, and his objective would be better understood within that storyline. It is important not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions without sufficient evidence to support them, as doing so can lead to misunderstandings and inaccurate judgements. In this specific case, we cannot conclude with certainty that \\"A man watches a woman with binoculars\\" simply based on the information contained in the initial statement.

Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart.

Determine the sentiment: First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** From the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-American, normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me (we Brits get enough from Hollywood) but here it's not subtle about making the Americans brain-dead morons. It goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a Yank has raped the directors mother. The grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill. Here we are introduced to the Olympic medallist Auntie and drunk Uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death, then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying. Hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis! The whole virus sideline is ridiculous. If the Americans know there isn't a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? The US government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look evil (or stupid), it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect. The movie is about hunting the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible. The only people hunting the monster, in the whole of Korea, is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally a few US/Korean agents try to stop them along the way. The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end. It was clichéd, you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that kid survive at the end? the monster had been swimming with it's head underwater for about 5 minutes! why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place?","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be identified as predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the majority of the movie after praising the initial 20 minutes for its CGI and the appearance of the monster. The following points indicate the negative sentiment: 1. The reviewer calls the movie anti-American and criticizes the unrealistic portrayal of Americans as \\"brain-dead morons.\\" 2. The grieving scene is described as \\"really poor,\\" and the reviewer highlights the unrealistic aspects of the family's interaction during the crisis. 3. The virus subplot is labeled \\"ridiculous,\\" and the reviewer questions its relevance and the portrayal of the US government agent as evil or foolish. 4. The reviewer criticizes the lack of visible involvement of US and Korean special forces in hunting the monster, as well as the introduction of a random character who saves the day. 5. The sister's role in the movie appears to be solely for the purpose of a clichéd ending, and the reviewer dislikes the lack of her involvement throughout the rest of the film. 6. Finally, the reviewer expresses annoyance with the unrealistic survival of the child at the end of the movie and questions the motivation of the monster in not eating the children. Overall, the negative aspects of the review heavily outweigh the initial positive comments, indicating a principally negative sentiment towards the movie."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What key details about fumiya fujii can be extracted from the following bio?

Choices: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"I will answer the first question about resolving an unresolved issue from school. 1. Identify the issue: Think back to the issue that happened in school and clearly define what it was, who was involved, and why it was never resolved before graduation. 2. Gather information: Collect any relevant information or evidence related to the issue. This may include old emails, letters, or witnesses who were present during the event. 3. Reflect on the situation: Take some time to reflect on your feelings and thoughts regarding the issue. This will help you to understand your perspective and how it may have changed over time. 4. Make a plan: Based on your reflections, determine the best course of action to resolve the issue. This might involve reaching out to the other person involved, seeking help from a mediator or counselor, or simply letting it go if you feel it no longer has relevance in your life. 5. Communicate: Open a line of communication with the other person involved, if there is one. Clearly express your feelings, thoughts, and intentions toward resolving the issue. Engage in active listening, validating their perspective, and working together to find a resolution. 6. Resolution: Find a resolution that is agreeable for all parties involved. This may involve a compromise, an apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing, or other actions to show sincerity and commitment to resolving the issue. Now, I will move on to answering the math question. To prove [math]int_0^{2pi} sin(mt)cos(nt) ,dt = 0[/math] for any integer [math]n[/math] and [math]m[/math], we can use the product-to-sum formula: [math]sin(mt) cos(nt) = frac{1}{2}[sin(m+n)t - sin(m-n)t][/math] Now, substituting this formula into the integral: [math]int_0^{2pi} (frac{1}{2}[sin(m+n)t - sin(m-n)t])dt = frac{1}{2}int_0^{2pi}(sin(m+n)t - sin(m-n)t)dt[/math] Now integrate each term separately: [math]frac{1}{2} [int_0^{2pi} sin(m+n)t ,dt - int_0^{2pi} sin(m-n)t,dt][/math] The integral of sine function is: [math]int sin(at), dt = -frac{1}{a} cos(at) + C[/math] Thus.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Callum Paterson - the subject of interest from Wigan Athletic - nodded the visitors ahead from Sam Nicholson's first-half corner. Thistle levelled after the break when Liam Lindsay's header crossed the line after hitting the bar. But, with time running out, striker Watt lashed a shot into the net from a tight angle. English clubs have already determined that Hearts' right-back Paterson is ready to move south - it is only differing opinions about his value that have prevented a move so far. Wigan may eventually raise their bid from the £700,000 rejected last week, but it is clear why Hearts are looking for more. Physically strong, a powerful runner and commanding in the air, Paterson's goal from Nicholson's corner was an emphatic header. He also plays an important role in Hearts' style. The team's shape is asymmetric, with Arnaud Djoum tucking in from right midfield and Nicholson playing wide on the left, requiring Paterson to provide width on the right flank, which he covers tirelessly. If the Scotland cap leaves this window, Hearts will sorely miss him. There was much to admire about both teams - their organisation, energy and ability to move the ball swiftly in crisp passages of play or directly. The coaching work of Alan Archibald and Robbie Neilson was evident, but personalities still shone through. Watt carries the ball deftly and has vision and clever instincts. Those qualities are all matched in Thistle's Chris Erskine, whose jinking, skilful runs were a feature throughout. He almost made a goal for Ade Azeez in the first half and it was his wing play that led to the corner that delivered Thistle's equaliser. Erskine took the set piece, too, swinging the ball in for Lindsay to score with a header off the underside of the bar. Sometimes managers can just allow individual ability to shine and Hearts were rewarded for leaving Watt on when he struck the winner. Neilson's starting line-up contained eight players who were called up for international duty last week, but it was the talent on their bench that set them apart. The Hearts head coach was able to bring on Bjorn Johnsen and Jamie Walker in the second half and, after Partick Thistle equalised, the visitors stepped up their tempo and pressure. That paid off in the end, but under different circumstances they might have brought on club captain Alim Ozturk, experienced midfielder Prince Buaben, young defender Liam Smith or attacker Robbie Muirhead. What Archibald would have given for those options. Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: \\"It was a sore one to take, but I thought we defended well in the second half and limited Hearts' chances. We were very unlucky with the outcome. \\"Our front four all did really well when we got the ball to them. They made things happen. I was going to take Chris [Erskine] off, but I thought he maybe had a goal in him or an assist late on. \\"If the window shuts [without making signings], it's not the end of the world, because there are still good players out there. But I'd like to get at least one in before then.\\" Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \\"We brought on [Jamie] Walker and Bjorn [Johnsen] to give us a lift, because we had an idea of the scores from other games. \\"[Strength in depth] is a huge advantage for us. So to have the option of changing it during the match like we did makes a huge difference. \\"You saw the quality of Tony Watt at the end.

Review: too much norma rae Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence seems to lean towards a negative connotation. The phrase \\"too much Norma Rae\\" likely refers to the 1979 film \\"Norma Rae\\" which focuses on a factory worker who becomes a local activist striving for better conditions. By saying \\"too much,\\" the reviewer is suggesting that the movie in question has overused or rehashed the themes and ideas from \\"Norma Rae,\\" and, as a result, may lack originality and innovation. Although it is not entirely negative, as comparing a film to \\"Norma Rae\\" could suggest that the movie possesses some positive elements, such as dealing with working-class struggles and human resilience, the overall tone of the review implies that the movie might be overly derivative or that it focuses too much on emulating the specific aspects of \\"Norma Rae\\" instead of offering a fresh perspective on these themes. Additionally, when a movie is compared to or criticized for being similar to another well-known film, it can imply that the movie might disappoint the audience who are looking for new stories, different perspectives, and unique approaches to the subject matter. This type of review can also be indirectly criticizing the filmmakers for a lack of creativity, suggesting that the movie doesn't have enough new ideas to stand on its own. While the review sentence does not outright dismiss the movie as terrible or unsatisfactory, it still conveys a somewhat negative sentiment, as the reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction with the movie's reliance on themes and ideas already explored in \\"Norma Rae.\\" In summary, the movie review sentence leans more negative than positive, primarily due to its critique of the film's originality and overuse of themes from another popular film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Diatoms are a major group of algae, and are among the most common types of phytoplankton. Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. \\"Fragilaria\\"), fans (e.g. \\"Meridion\\"), zigzags (e.g. \\"Tabellaria\\"), or stars (e.g. \\"Asterionella\\"). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial \\"Bacillaria paradoxa\\", was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality. - Trigonella is a genus from the family Fabaceae. The best known member is the herb fenugreek. - Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, \\"tres\\" \\"three\\" + \\"folium\\" \\"leaf\\"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled, cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include \\"Melilotus\\" (sweet clover) and \\"Medicago\\" (alfalfa or Calvary clover). - Alfalfa , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 1020 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine. - Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, NN, to be used in other ways. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the \\"Trifolium\\" clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide. - Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (\\"M. sativa\\"), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, \\"medica\\", from median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (\\"M. arborea\\") is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in \\"Medicago\\" range from 2\\"n\\" = 14 to 48. - Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. \\"Rhizobium\\" species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of legumes and \\"\\". - Medicago falcata is a plant species of the genus Medicago . It is native to the Mediterranean basin , but is found throughout the world . It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which is capable of nitrogen fixation . Its common names include blue alfalfa , sickle alfalfa , sickle medick , yellow lucerne , and yellow - flowered alfalfa . - Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the group of saponin compounds. Triterpenes are a type of terpene containing 30 carbon atoms. Triterpenes are assembled from a five-carbon isoprene unit through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to make a thirty-carbon compound. Some triterpenes are steroidal in nature. Cholesterol, phytosterols and phytoecdysteroids are triterpenes. The triterpenes are subdivided into some 20 groups, depending on their particular structures. Some triterpenoid compounds are found as saponin glycosides which refers to the attachment of various sugar molecules to the triterpene unit. These sugars can be cleaved off in the gut by bacteria, sometimes allowing the aglycone (triterpene) to be absorbed into the bloodstream or to insert into cell membranes. - Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word \\"flavus\\" meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites. - Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. The Fabaceae include legume crops such as beans and peas. - Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium (rhizobium). It forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera \\"Medicago\\", \\"Melilotus\\" and \\"Trigonella\\", including the model legume \\"Medicago truncatula\\". This symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule. The \\"S. meliloti\\" genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases) and two chromids, pSymA (~1.4 megabases) and pSymB (~1.7 megabases). Five \\"S. meliloti\\" genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11 - Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant 1060 cm tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, 12 cm long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod. - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.

A thorough research process ensures the content is accurate, informative, and credible. Step 2: Create an outline To ensure the article is well-structured and organized, creating an outline makes it easier to divide the content into appropriate sections. The outline should include the introduction, background, key reasons, possible consequences, and conclusion. Outline: 1. Introduction 2. The background of spotted owl and barred owl populations 3. Reasons for this intervention 4. The methods used 5. Possible consequences 6. Conclusion Step 3: Write the introduction The introduction should catch the reader's attention and provide a brief overview of what the article will discuss. It should set the tone for the rest of the article and provide context for the situation. Introduction: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has recently implemented a controversial program to save the endangered northern spotted owl. The plan includes killing barred owls, a close cousin species that has contributed to the spotted owl's population decline. This article will explore the background of the issue, reasons for this intervention, methods used, possible consequences, and its long-term implications. Step 4: Write the background The background section should focus on the history, habitat, and population trends of both owl species. It should also discuss the causes behind the population decline of spotted owls. Background: The northern spotted owl, native to the Pacific Northwest, has been an endangered species since 1990 due to logging and habitat loss. Barred owls, which primarily inhabited the East Coast and Midwest, expanded their range westward in the 20th century, resulting in direct competition with the spotted owl for food and nesting sites. Barred owls are more aggressive and adaptable, outcompeting spotted owls and contributing to their dwindling numbers. Step 5: Explain the reasons for intervention This section should focus on the USFWS's rationale for intervening in such a drastic manner and any alternative solutions considered. Reasons for intervention: The USFWS decided to intervene by controlling the barred owl population, citing this invasive species' impact on spotted owl numbers. The goal is to give the spotted owl a better chance to recover by reducing its direct competition. While less drastic alternatives have been considered, such as habitat restoration and captive breeding, these solutions have not been as effective in the short term as the culling of barred owls. Step 6: Describe the methods used This section should provide information on how the USFWS is carrying out the barred owl removal and any related legal or ethical concerns. Methods used: Trained wildlife officials are tasked with locating and humanely euthanizing barred owls in specified areas. The process obeys strict guidelines to ensure minimal distress to the birds. Despite the USFWS's careful approach, the culling has sparked debate among conservationists and animal rights activists. Step 7: Discuss possible consequences The possible consequences section should discuss the potential outcomes and long-term effects of the culling program, both positive and negative. Possible consequences: This intervention poses several possible consequences, such as providing the spotted owl with a chance to recover and regain its native habitat. On the other hand, there are concerns that culling barred owls may disrupt the ecosystem and have unintended effects on other species. Step 8: Write the conclusion The conclusion should summarize the article's main points and offer a balanced perspective on the intervention, acknowledging its potential benefits and drawbacks. Conclusion: The USFWS's decision to cull barred owls in an effort to save the endangered northern spotted owl underscores the complexity of species conservation. While this intervention may offer a short-term solution for the spotted owl population, it's important to recognize that broader habitat restoration and environmental protection measures are crucial for long-term conservation efforts. Ultimately, the success of such interventions depends on a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystems involved and their delicate balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","completion":"(iii) No The statement \\"They had been heading there all the time\\" indicates that they were indeed going to the mentioned place throughout a certain period. So it does not follow that \\"They weren't going there.\\" The reason behind this answer is the usage of the past continuous tense \\"had been heading\\" in the original statement. This verb tense signals that the action was ongoing throughout a specified time or before another past event, which is consistent with the contention of heading towards the destination. Conversely, the contradictory statement \\"They weren't going there\\" employs the past continuous negative form \\"weren't going.\\" It implies the exact opposite—which is that they were not going to the destination during that specified time. It directly contradicts the information conveyed in the original statement. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that the statement \\"They had been heading there all the time\\" implies that they weren't going there.

The White House is connected to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in the centre of the building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site. Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief's (later succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development) home. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings. The Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still standing, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the last remaining well on site, known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict site, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park . Close by, The Leopard Gates mark the original entrance to Gilwell Park, and were carved by Gilwlel master craftsman Don Potter in 1928. The Lid, which originally consisted of a roof but no walls, was a wet weather shelter built in 1967. In 2009, the building was renovated and now consists of a large activity hall, two classrooms, staff space and a large store room added The activity hall houses all the indoor activities on-site, including an archery range and climbing walls. In front of The Lid, is the Tait McKenzie Statue, gifted by the Boy Scouts of America in 1966.

This percentage could fluctuate slightly due to demographic changes, and it is important to note that there are varying degrees of religious observance among the Jewish citizens of Israel, including secular, traditional, and Orthodox Jews. Furthermore, Israel is recognized as the only Jewish-majority state globally, and it is home to the largest Jewish population, surpassing the United States in recent years.

The answer to the question: What authors used a writing style that broke away from the style started during the Han dynasty? is inside the article: The Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (騙體文, \\"parallel prose\\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct. This guwen (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with orthodox Neo-Confucianism.Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the..., can you guess it ?

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the neighborhood that is now upscale and a shopping district? from the following article ? Efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris, repair buildings, and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion. By late January 1918, around 5,000 were still without shelter. A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units, which were furnished by the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Fund.Partial train service resumed from a temporary rail terminal in the city's South End on 7 December. Full service resumed on 9 December when tracks were cleared and the North Street Station reopened. The Canadian Government Railways created a special unit to clear and repair railway yards as well as rebuild railway piers and the Naval Dockyard. Most piers returned to operation by late December and were repaired by January. The North End Halifax neighbourhood of Richmond bore the brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction... Answer:","completion":"The name of the neighborhood that is now upscale and a shopping district, as mentioned in the article, is the Hydrostone neighbourhood in the North End of Halifax. This neighborhood was reconstructed and modernized after the explosion, with the Halifax Relief Commission using the opportunity to improve the area. New housing plans were designed by Thomas Adams and the architectural firm Ross and Macdonald, incorporating fireproof material and providing public access to green spaces.

The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, also known as the Orange Africa Cup of Nations South Africa 2013 for sponsorship reasons, was the 29th Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The tournament took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. The matches were held in five different cities in South Africa, namely Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Rustenburg, and Nelspruit. Nigeria's victory in the tournament marked the third time the Super Eagles had won the competition. Their previous tournament wins were in 1980 and 1994. Under the stewardship of their coach, Stephen Keshi, Nigeria won the tournament, defeating Burkina Faso in the final. The winning goal was scored by Nigeria's Sunday Mba on 40 minutes, securing a 1-0 victory for the Super Eagles. This moment was particularly significant as Stephen Keshi became one of the few individuals who has won the Africa Cup of Nations both as a player and a coach. Keshi was part of the team that lifted the trophy in 1994 when Nigeria won their second title. In addition to the championship, Nigeria’s achievement also included qualifying for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil as the representative from CAF. The 2013 win helped to support Nigeria's ranking in the FIFA World Rankings, too. However, it is also worth mentioning that Nigerian national football team could not carry the trophy to home in several following years of African Cup of Nations. After the 2013 victory, their best result in the tournament has been a semi-final place in the 2019 competition, where they finished third."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", is \\"very happy\\" a valid answer?","completion":"Yes, \\"very happy\\" can be a valid answer to describe Addison, especially in the context of their recent graduation from college. Graduation is a significant milestone in a person's life, reflecting the successful completion of years of hard work, dedication, and efforts to pursue their education. This accomplishment is often accompanied by a tremendous sense of achievement, satisfaction, and happiness. However, while \\"very happy\\" may accurately describe Addison's emotional state due to their recent graduation, it provides a limited view of Addison as a person. To develop a more well-rounded and in-depth understanding of Addison, one should consider various aspects of their personality, experiences, and characteristics. Some factors to consider when attempting to describe Addison might include: 1. Academic Performance: Was Addison an outstanding student, consistently demonstrating academic excellence? Or were they an average student who had to work diligently to maintain decent grades? 2. Area of Study: Did Addison study a subject they were passionate about, or did they follow a specific career path to meet external expectations or societal norms? 3. Personal Interests: What kind of hobbies or extracurricular activities does Addison enjoy? Their interests might provide insight into their personality traits, such as creativity, dedication, or competitiveness. 4. Social Life: Was Addison an extroverted person who made many friends and enjoyed participating in social events, or were they more introverted and preferred to spend time alone or in small groups? 5. Resilience and Persistence: Did Addison face any significant obstacles or challenges during their time in college, such as personal issues, financial difficulties, or academic setbacks? How did they handle these challenges and recover from them? 6. Personal Values and Ethics: What are Addison's fundamental beliefs and principles? Do they prioritize honesty, integrity, and kindness towards others, or are they more driven by ambition and personal success? 7. Future Plans and Goals: Now that Addison has graduated from college, what do they hope to achieve in their personal and professional life? Does their graduation mark the beginning of new endeavors or a continuation of ongoing pursuits? While describing Addison as \\"very happy\\" in reference to their recent graduation is valid, it is essential to recognize that this description is only one aspect of their overall personality and experiences. By considering various factors and dimensions of Addison's life, one can develop a comprehensive and accurate understanding of who they indeed are."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

University of California study also found those who felt powerless smiled at everyone regardless of rank.","completion":"Title: Why Powerful People Don't Smile Back at Important People Once upon a time, a smart researcher named Evan Carr made an exciting discovery. He noticed that when people feel powerful, they don't usually smile back at important people. But why is this important? Well, Evan found out that people do this because they don't want to look too friendly to someone who might be a threat to them. It's like when you're playing tag, and you don't want to let the person who's \\"it\\" be too close to you. Powerful people think that being too friendly could make them seem weaker to others. But guess what? Evan also found out that people who feel powerless smile at everyone, no matter how important they are. It's like they're trying to make friends with everyone in the playground, even the teacher, or the school principal. Evan's research took place at a big, important school called the University of California. They did lots of tests and talked to many people to learn more about this smiling adventure. So the next time you see someone important not smiling back at a powerful person, you'll know it's because they're trying to protect themselves, just like in a game of tag.

Differences between conversational usage and strict grammatical forms are shown but the emphasis is on controversial forms. In the fourth edition the main changes are as follows. 1. Explanation and examples have been brought up to date. 2. There is now more information on countable and uncountable nouns, attributive and predicative adjectives, adverbs of place, sentence adverbs, cleft sentences, prepositions, conjunctives, modal verbs, perfect tenses, infinitive constructions, the passive, purpose clauses and nouns. 3. Some material has been rearranged to make comparisons easier. For example, parts of chapters on can, may, must etc. are now grouped by functions; verbs of liking and preference have a chapter to themselves; suggestions and invitations have joined the chapter on commands, requests and advice. 4. The contents list now summaries every edition heading, and there is a new index containing many more entries references. In this edition the sign \\"~\\" is frequently used to show a change of speaker in examples of dialogue.

Katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. Anybody who questions the politician is labeled a \\"traitor\\" and becomes an assassination target. One of the best photographed films ever, many shots are incredible compositions of form, color and light. The fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes a part of the color palette Gosha uses for his images. Gorgeous and disturbing.

Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was 40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC.

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible.

The film revolves around the whirlwind romance and subsequent marriage between Peter, a young botany professor, and Francey, a nightclub singer played by Ginger Rogers. The couple's attempts to find a moment alone together continuously get thwarted, adding comedic elements to the movie's storyline. The conflict arises as Peter is too afraid to reveal the news of his marriage to his father, Mr. Morgan, who has a reputation for being a proud and overbearing man. Mr. Morgan, as well as Peter's high-society fiancée Helen, initially mistakes Francey for one of Keith's girlfriends (Keith is Peter's playboy cousin, played by James Ellison). To buy himself some time, Peter enlists Keith's help to introduce Francey as a new botany student while she stays at a women-only hotel. Throughout the film, Peter makes several attempts to tell his father about his marriage but is repeatedly interrupted, and each time Peter finally tries to insist on discussing the matter, his mother's heart condition flares up, halting any potential conversation. This series of unfortunate events culminates at the university's student-faculty prom, where Peter plans to finally announce his marriage. However, things don't go as planned, and when he eventually blurts out the news to his father just before a crucial speech, it results in an argument and another flare-up of his mother's heart condition. Mrs. Morgan, played by Beulah Bondi, only learns of Francey's identity after a conversation in Francey's hotel room, where she accidentally reveals her relationship with Peter. Upon discovering this information, Mr. Morgan demands that Francey leave his son.

Muhammad Ali wasn't a mere boxer; he was a man who changed his name and faith, a man who would fight anybody in a ring but refused to go to a war, a perfect physical specimen and a loudmouth who fell frail and all but mute from an affliction he couldn't beat. Lots of fighters won fights. The stories are what have made Ali Ali. It separates names from the norm. He or she is not just a success but a remarkable story, an inspiration, a believe-it-or-not. He was a left-handed pitcher with no right hand who threw a no-hitter for the New York Yankees. (Jim Abbott.) He ran in the Olympic Games on prosthetic legs. (Oscar Pistorius.) She sprinted to an Olympic gold even though they once nearly amputated her feet. (Gail Devers.) You can't make up stories like those. Joe DiMaggio was a ballplayer. We know that Joe played ball better than most. But we also know Joe was married to Marilyn Monroe. We cannot tell you a lot about Willie Mays or Stan Musial except how they played ball. Both played it as well as Joe did ... hey, maybe better. But in some cases, the stories of certain greats are as unforgettable as their deeds. So, we tell their tales. The subjects often furnish the details. We rely on honesty for accuracy. A story that has been reported is a story that ends up repeated because it must be true. We lazily assume facts not in evidence. Or we lean on: \\"Who would make up such a thing?\\" Which brings us to Manti Te'o. The grim fairy tale of The Linebacker Of Notre Dame is one we likely will tell for a while. We woke up Thursday morning and began reading a story that got curiouser and curiouser with every sentence. His girlfriend wasn't real? She wasn't in a car crash? She didn't die of leukemia? He never met her? She didn't even exist??? Irish blarney is a myth, is it not? Pots o' gold and St. Patrick and the snakes and how are things in Glocca Morra and all that? Aye, we aren't so gullible that we will swallow anything, would we, now? So, OK. We tell and retell the true and false legends of Knute Rockne and winning one for the Gipper and all that, but we don't really mind. And maybe that October sky wasn't really as blue-grey as Grantland Rice told us it was when those Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rode to a great Notre Dame victory on the ol' gridiron. \\"South Bend, it sounds almost like dancing!\\" gushed Katharine Hepburn in \\"The Philadelphia Story,\\" and what a funny story that was. Manti Te'o's story, however .... not so funny. He is a Notre Dame football star. Trust me, this alone is not a news event. Notre Dame turns out football stars the way Hostess turned out Twinkies. One after another after another. He is also a Hawaiian kid with an apostrophe in his surname. Now that, that is not something you see on a Notre Dame football field every Saturday. A nice, noteworthy thing, something that separated Te'o from the pack, somewhat. He is also a natural born leader. One who helped take Notre Dame to an undefeated season -- rare, in this day and age -- and to the national championship game. In the vote for the Heisman Trophy, given to college football's top player of any given season, Te'o was the runner-up. That in itself is an honor, but for a linebacker to do such a thing, a defensive player, it is truly cool. Ahhh, but there was more to the Manti Te'o story, as we watched that story unfold. He had this girlfriend, see. Lennay Kekua was her lovely name. And she died. A few months ago, she was in a car crash, we were told. And then doctors found she also had leukemia, we were told. Her death, as well as that of his grandmother, broke Te'o's heart. But on he played, gallantly, valiantly, fighting on for the Fighting Irish, remaining undefeated against adversity. Until at some point it turned out to be a hoax. Which at some point Notre Dame's administrators discovered. Which at some point Te'o confirmed, although not publicly, not before that January 7 championship game against Alabama. Brent Musburger made the Alabama quarterback's girlfriend an overnight sensation that night, gushing about her looks. Musburger did not make the Notre Dame linebacker's girlfriend a star that night. She wasn't there. Turns out, she was never anywhere. We love a good story and will continue to tell them. I, myself, once wrote of a Notre Dame football star, Chris Zorich, who played in the Orange Bowl one night, flew home to Chicago the next morning and found his mother dead inside their home. I made people cry with that story. I damn near cried myself while typing it. Manti Te'o's story makes me want to laugh as much as cry. Mainly because I can barely comprehend it. All those stories being told out there on TV and in print about his \\"girlfriend\\" -- uh, he might have mentioned to someone that he'd never even met her. How do the movies put it? \\"Based on a true story?\\" Well, based on a story, anyhow. Everybody's is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Manti Te'o, a Notre Dame football star, had a heartbreaking and inspiring story surrounding him as he triumphed on the field. He had a girlfriend named Lennay Kekua, who was in a car crash and later diagnosed with leukemia, eventually passing away. This story of personal tragedy motivated Te'o, making him a symbol of strength and courage in the face of adversity. However, it was later revealed that Kekua never existed and the entire narrative was a hoax. This story captured the public's attention and fascination, highlighting our love for inspiring and dramatic stories. The Manti Te'o story serves as a reminder of the power of storytelling and our willingness to believe in tales that touch our emotions, even when they turn out to be false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the name of Beckett's partner? Title: Philadelphia Movie plot: Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a senior associate at the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia. Although he lives with his partner Miguel Álvarez (Antonio Banderas), Beckett is not open about his homosexuality at the law firm, nor the fact that he has AIDS. On the day he is assigned the firm's newest and most important case, one of the firm's partners notices a small lesion on Beckett's forehead. Shortly thereafter, Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. While at home, he finishes the complaint for the case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file the complaint in court on the following day, which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case. Beckett suffers from bowel spasms at home and is rushed to the hospital. Later that morning, while still at the ER, he receives a frantic call from the firm asking for the complaint, as the paper copy cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer's hard drive. However, the complaint is finally discovered and is filed with the court at the last possible moment. The following day, Beckett is dismissed by the firm's partners, who had previously referred to him as their \\"buddy\\", but now question his professional abilities in light of the misplaced document. Beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm a pretext to fire him, and that the firing is actually as a result of his diagnosis with AIDS. He asks several attorneys to take his case, including personal injury lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), with whom he had been involved in a previous case. Miller, who is admittedly homophobic and knows little about Beckett's AIDS, initially declines to take the case and immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the AIDS through shaking Beckett's hand. The doctor explains the methods of HIV infection. The doctor then offers to take a sample of Miller's blood, suspecting that Miller was...

See how close they are to you and whether there are any obstacles, like desks or chairs, that might slow you down if you have to get to the door quickly. This seems easy, since you walk through your classroom doors almost every day, but reviewing their location will help it become second nature and make it easier to remember in an emergency. If you can evacuate safely, this is often considered the best option for getting away from a school shooting. However, each scenario is different. If you know you can’t run away safely, stay in place and hide. Estimate how far off the ground the windows are to see if you could jump out of them safely in case of an emergency. Watch how your teacher opens and closes the windows, and volunteer to help them to see how it’s done. You could even stay behind a few minutes after class to practice opening and closing the windows quickly. Ask your teacher first, explaining to them that you want to be as prepared as possible in case of an emergency. Escaping through the windows especially good option if your classroom has windows that face the outside and you know, as well as you can, that the shooter is inside. When you get a free moment in class, challenge yourself to think of the quickest route off campus from your current location. Figure this out for each of your classes so you can be prepared just in case you need to make a quick getaway. Do the same thing for anywhere else that you spend a lot of time on campus, such as the cafeteria, gym, or sports fields. Challenge yourself to take different routes to class and to explore areas of campus that you’re not as familiar with. Find the fastest way out from every area on campus, as well as alternate routes in case some ways are blocked off or inaccessible. Look around campus after school or during lunch when you’re allowed to be out and about. In the unlikely event of a shooting threat, your in-depth knowledge of your school can help you make a quick getaway. Once you’ve set up your own mental evacuation routes, go over them in your head every few days to keep them fresh. Your goal is to turn these routes into an instinct, so that you know how to evacuate in case it ever becomes necessary. Your school probably has its own evacuation routes in place for the unlikely event of a shooting. If you haven’t already learned these routes through drills, you can ask a teacher or administrator what they are. Remember that in a school shooting situation, you likely won’t be on your own. You can follow the lead of teachers and other adults who are trained to take care of you in these situations.

Given the question: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. The Farlook forest is classified as a tropical forest, and the Celeste forest is not a tropical forest.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the two brands of amplifiers that grunge guitarists commonly use are Marshall and Mesa-Boogie. Grunge guitarists, such as Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl, gravitated towards these brands for their ability to produce a thick, sludgy electric guitar sound with a high level of distortion and fuzz, which is characteristic of the grunge genre. Marshall amplifiers have been widely used in the grunge scene for their loud, powerful sound and their versatility. These amplifiers helped shape the heavy, distorted tones that grunge guitarists aimed for. Many grunge artists opted for Marshall amplifiers because of their reliability and robustness in delivering a consistent sound, even at high volume levels. Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, on the other hand, were favored by some grunge guitarists for their ability to deliver powerful, thick tones with ample amounts of distortion. Mesa-Boogie amplifiers often provide a more aggressive sound than Marshall amplifiers, which some grunge guitarists find particularly appealing for their music. Kurt Cobain and early grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs are examples where Mesa-Boogie amplifiers were used to achieve the signature grunge sound. In addition to the amplifiers, grunge guitarists often employed various stompbox pedals to further enhance their distorted, fuzzy tones. The Fender Twin Reverb and Fender Champion 100 combo amps are also mentioned for their usage by grunge guitarists like Cobain. The use of pedals in grunge music is a departure from the expensive studio-grade rackmount effects units commonly used in other rock genres. This preference for stompbox pedals is exemplified by Mudhoney's debut EP, Superfuzz Bigmuff, which references two popular overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff. Grunge's distinctive sound, characterized by heavy distortion, loud amps, and powerful power chords played on the electric guitar, can be attributed to a combination of these amplifiers and stompbox pedals, providing a unique sonic experience that has been both celebrated and criticized over the years. Through the use of Marshall and Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, alongside various stompbox pedals, grunge guitarists shaped the genre's signature \\"lugubrious\\" and heavily distorted sound."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

My girlfriend and I are both liberal in almost every sense of the word. We have never disagreed about anything you could call a political issue. I've always been more reserved in expressing my political opinions for a lot of reasons (some for professional reasons, but mostly because it's never comfortable). For the last two years, for obvious reasons, politics had become a bigger part of our daily life than I'm okay with. So I tend to not respond to her attempts to start conversation, or I politely (as politely as I can) tell her I'm not in the mood to talk about it. She knows it makes me angry and uncomfortable and if it's all the same I'd rather leave it out of my day. Things came to a head tonight when she convinced me to watch the Netflix documentary \\"Get Me Roger Stone\\" and I couldn't finish it. I was getting too angry, I've got work tomorrow, I can't be dwelling on things like this while I'm trying to run a small business. To her credit, she said she understood and was happy to switch it to something else. But when I mentioned, in passing, that I was recommending the doc to my mother (who has the same views and outspokenness of my girlfriend), she began to start the same usual rant about the state of things and was upset I didn't finish it. I politely told her I still wasn't in the mood to talk about it but wanted to share that I was passing along her recommendation to my mom. She got pretty upset, telling me that it was important for people to be politically aware, and that, since her entire family are far right wing, I am the only person she can talk to about this. I told her I was aware, but didn't want that awareness to derail the little free time I have, especially with her, and wanted to stay in a good mood. And that there's no use in discussing if it's just to an echo chamber. We'd be angrily agreeing with each other for hours. And that I didn't appreciate her insinuation that I was blissfully and intentionally ignorant to what's been going on for the sake of my own comfort, I just didn't want to talk about it. She lost her cool and stormed off, because she was getting angry and uncomfortable, even though I was willing to keep discussing it, at least to explain where I was coming from. I didn't want to point out the irony in any of that, because that might have made me the asshole. And I was happy the topic was being dropped. But now we're sharing an awkward silence and I'm worried that I may be selfish and calloused to her needs due to the discomfort that usually prevents my own family taking about political or religious topics. Or that I'm selfish in considering my own comfort over her's. But nobody's comfortable getting increasingly upset about this kind of stuff, even if it is an echo chamber. Am I the asshole?

This intriguing phenomenon sheds light on the world of late-night comedy writing. It's not unusual for late-night shows to touch on similar topics, as they are often responding to the same current events or gossip worthy of a laugh. However, it's rare that their jokes would align so closely as they did in this instance. This raises the question of whether comedy writers tend to share ideas or simply think alike due to the nature of their profession. One possibility is that comedy writers have an unspoken network of communication, sharing joke ideas to achieve a stronger sense of unity within the industry. This collaboration may help them come up with more effective punchlines by pooling their collective creativity. However, this theory may seem unlikely to some, given the competitiveness of comedy and the powerful incentive for jokes to remain original, as they are intellectual property protected by copyright law. Another plausible explanation is that comedy writers share a similar thought process, which can cause them to independently develop very similar jokes. For instance, they may have a greater sensitivity to humor in everyday situations, or possess a strong inclination towards sarcasm. This would mean that their minds are primed to think in a certain way, and as a result, they end up devising parallel jokes when faced with the same stimulus. It is also worth considering that comedy writers consume similar content, both for inspiration and to keep up with current trends and events. This shared body of common knowledge, coupled with the writers' ability to identify comedic opportunities, may lead them to unknowingly create closely aligned jokes. Additionally, comedy writers are often influenced by their favorite comedic sources or performers, which can invariably lead to overlapping ideas. Ultimately, the fact that Leno and Letterman shared such similar jokes on this particular night seems to be more of a rare coincidence than an indicator of a larger trend. It's unlikely that comedy writers frequently share ideas enough to account for the similarity in material, as doing so would undermine the creativity and originality that is valued in the field. However, the striking commonality observed in this case does prompt a deeper examination of the creative processes that underlie the craft of comedy writing, and it wouldn't be surprising to discover that there's a lot more shared subconscious inspiration at play than we think."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pick your answer from: --his relationship with middle easterners is strained --he doesn't like sandy warfare --not enough information --his son lost his life during combat Q: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010.

Salariile mici, statutul social scăzut al specialiştilor din domeniul medical, precum şi proasta gestionare a sistemului, sunt doar câteva dintre problemele din sectorul sănătăţii, a declarat un medic din Sofia cu o experienţă de 22 de ani în otolaringologie pentru SETimes. Translate to English","completion":"\\"Low salaries, the low social status of healthcare specialists, as well as poor management of the system, are just a few of the problems in the healthcare sector,\\" said a doctor from Sofia with 22 years of experience in otolaryngology for SETimes. The healthcare sector faces numerous challenges that contribute to its current state. Among these challenges, low salaries, the decreased social status of medical professionals, and poor management of the system are some of the most pressing issues. These problems not only affect patient care but can also lead to a shortage of skilled healthcare workers and limit advancements in medical science. Low salaries for medical professionals can have significant consequences for both patient care and the healthcare system as a whole. When salaries do not reflect the high level of skill and dedication required for a medical career, many talented and qualified individuals may opt for other professions or seek work in countries where they will be fairly compensated for their expertise. As a result, the healthcare system may face a scarcity of well-trained professionals who can provide high-quality care to patients. The low social status of healthcare specialists can also impact the sector negatively. Historically, healthcare professionals have been respected and admired for their knowledge and their commitment to saving lives. However, when their social standing is diminished, it can lead to a lack of appreciation for their work and dedication. This can result in job dissatisfaction and burnout, causing medical professionals to leave their positions or even the field, further exacerbating shortages in the healthcare sector. Poor management of the healthcare system is another critical issue contributing to the current challenges faced by the sector. Mismanagement at various levels, including insufficient funding, improper allocation of resources, and ineffective leadership, can cause systemic inefficiencies that affect patient care. Hospitals may be inadequately staffed, lacking in necessary equipment or unable to provide essential services. This not only leads to a reduction in the quality of care provided to patients but can also dissuade potential medical professionals from pursuing careers in healthcare. In conclusion, the healthcare sector faces significant hurdles, including low salaries, decreased social status for medical professionals, and poor management of the system. These problems can lead to widespread consequences, such as a shortage of skilled healthcare workers, reduced quality of patient care, and limited progress in medical science. To address these issues and improve the healthcare system, it is essential to prioritize fair compensation for healthcare professionals, recognize and appreciate their contributions to society, and implement effective management practices at all levels of the healthcare system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

US planes and artillery pounded Falluja on Monday and Iraq #39;s interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said he had authorized a US-led offensive to rid the Sunni Muslim city of insurgents. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a military operation in Falluja, a city in Iraq, that took place on a Monday as a part of the ongoing conflict between coalition forces led by the United States and insurgents in the region. It provides information about the involvement of US planes and artillery in carrying out heavy bombardment in the city. The operation was aimed at eliminating the Sunni Muslim insurgents from Falluja, and was authorized by Iraq's interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi. To provide a more detailed understanding of the events, it is important to consider the historical context in which this operation took place. Falluja is a city located in the Al Anbar province of Iraq, which is known for being a stronghold for various insurgent groups, including members of the Iraqi insurgency, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and later, the Islamic State (ISIS). The city has witnessed numerous instances of violence and military operations since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the invasion, a power vacuum was created in Iraq that led to the rise of various militant and insurgent groups, which sought to destabilize the newly-formed Iraqi government and challenge the presence of coalition forces in the country. Falluja became a focal point of the insurgency, with the city's large Sunni population providing a base of support for the militants. In response to the growing insurgent presence in Falluja, the US-led coalition carried out frequent operations to regain control over the city and eliminate the threat posed by the militants. The text refers to one such operation, authorized by Iraq's interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi. Allawi was appointed as the interim Prime Minister after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, and was tasked with overseeing Iraq's political transition until the formation of a permanent post-invasion government. During this operation, US planes and artillery played a significant role in carrying out heavy bombardments aimed at weakening the insurgent forces in the city. The use of aerial and artillery bombardment is a common tactic in urban warfare and counterinsurgency operations as it allows for the targeting of well-entrenched enemy positions, while minimizing risk to friendly ground forces. While the text does not provide specific details about the outcomes of the operation, it is likely that this was one of various efforts to regain control over Falluja and other areas in Iraq during this time period. The continued military operations, political negotiations, and efforts to rebuild the country have played a major role in shaping Iraq's post-invasion landscape and the ongoing insurgency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The single reached #3 on the Australian Music Charts. The band's American label, Elektra Records, was hoping that they could come up with something a bit easier to market than the witty, 1960s-obsessed pop/rock of \\"Stoneage Romeos\\" and \\"Mars Needs Guitars!\\", so they paired the group with producer Mark Opitz, who had previously produced records for AC/DC, INXS, and the Divinyls.

Download Foursquare for your smart phone and start exploring the world around you! ||||| Foursquare has just gained its highest-profile user yet: President Barack Obama. \\"The White House is now on Foursquare, a location-based social networking website, which is the latest way for you to engage with the administration,\\" The White House said on its blog. \\"There are over 10 million people already 'checking in' around the world, and now you’ll be able to discover 'tips' from the White House featuring the places President Obama has visited, what he did there, plus historical information and more.\\" The White House says that it will be posting tips about the president's visits around the country as he embarks on an economic bus tour across the Midwest. The White House will also be creating checkin locations for different presidential events. The White House posted its first tip on its page on Monday, revealing that the president delivered a speech in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, where he discussed ways to grow and strengthen the economy. Obama joining Foursquare comes just hours after the geosocial network unveiled Tip Lists, a feature that lets users and brands bundle and curate their best tips into easy-to-follow lists. It seems that the White House will be using Tip Lists as a way to track the president's visits across the country as he begins his campaign for reelection. The addition of the president to Foursquare's 10 million-plus users could be a watershed moment for the mobile service, especially as the 2012 campaign kicks into high gear. Expect a lot more people to join Foursquare very soon. ||||| First Facebook, then Twitter and now Foursquare; Obama sure gets around (social platforms). As announced today on the White House blog, Obama will be checking in to the location-based service as he hits stops on his economic bus tour in the Midwest. Of course. Users who want to follow Barack can check out the White House Foursquare page here, where they can now subscribe to White House Tips as well as check in to the White House when they visit as well as Presidential events. And Barack has already left his first “Tip” linking to a blog post about the tour’s first stop at Lower Hannah’s Bend Park in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Eh, someone should tell him that’s not exactly how they’re used. One wonders how much of this social media outreach is the doing of newly brought on Obama campaign CTO (and former Threadless CTO) Harper Reed who is hep to these things, and how useful the location-based service will be in getting the word out to supporters. In any case it seems like you need to follow the President through his page to actually find him — searching for “Barack Obama” on the mobile app got me a guy in Salt Lake City Utah and a Barack Obama in London. While probably the service’s most famous, Barack isn’t the only politician on Foursquare. Mayor Bloomberg famously checked into the Marriage Equalitocalypse earlier this summer and Mitt Romney and Cory Booker are also sharing their checkins with fans. *Insert joke about Obama automatically being the mayor of everything he visits here.* Also: It seems like Foursquare has set up the White House Page to automatically follow people back, otherwise Obama would be fielding A LOT of friend requests. I personally can’t wait until he joins Instagram. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article talks about President Barack Obama joining a fun website called Foursquare. Foursquare is a website where people can share with their friends the places they visit. The White House, which is where the President lives and works, is also on Foursquare now. This way, people can see the places President Obama visits and learn about interesting things he does while traveling. This will help people connect with the President and learn more about his activities, especially during his campaign for re-election. Other politicians are also on Foursquare, but having the President on it is very exciting for its users and might inspire more people to join the website."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For all the hoopla, respect and recognition this film gets from Kung Fu historians, it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas: action and fight scenes. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I've ever seen in a martial arts film. Five Deadly Venoms without a doubt is a must see, not only that, a movie you can watch again and again; but I also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better. It somehow leaves you wanting something, you want more. The producer Chang Cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn't follow through with giving us more of the action we want. The fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer (Centipede,Snake,Scorpion,Lizard,Toad) and they are shown, but battles are noticeably short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much, much more, in fact the Toad is killed off by the middle of the movie. Interestingly enough with this movie, the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome. This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel. To start off the movie and to introduce the Poison Clan producer Chang Cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon. The ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more. Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the movie would conclude with this: The styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail, sad thing is , the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn't expand on it. I am left wondering what could have been with this movie, still one of the best though. 8 out of 10 on the scale.

Kyle doesn't have arms.","completion":"Option 1: Christopher doesn't have arms. Christopher and Kyle had known each other since high school. Back then, they were simply classmates, but as time passed, they got closer and became best friends. Christopher was born without arms, and Kyle had always been supportive and empathetic towards his friend's situation. After graduating from college, they decided to move in together and face the world as two young professionals. Christopher was a remote software developer, relying mostly on voice-command coding programs, while Kyle worked in finance. Despite their different fields, their friendship grew stronger than ever. As adults, Christopher's reliance on Kyle for daily activities increased. Though he tried to retain as much independence as possible, he couldn't help depending on Kyle for things like cooking meals, doing laundry, or helping him with his personal hygiene. Kyle, being the kind-hearted and caring person he was, never complained or hesitated in helping his friend. But sometimes, he couldn't help but feel that he was taking on too much responsibility. Feeling overburdened, Kyle finally decided to talk to Christopher about finding ways to lessen his friend's dependence on him. They searched for solutions together, and soon came across various technologies that could assist Christopher in becoming more independent. They discovered robotic prosthetic arms that Christopher could control with his mind. After some consideration, Christopher decided to go through the procedure of getting these prosthetics, which would allow him to perform most daily tasks on his own. Following a successful procedure, Christopher was now able to handle daily tasks such as cooking and doing laundry. Along with the physical changes, he gained newfound confidence and self-esteem. On the other hand, Kyle felt relieved that his friend could now perform these tasks independently and was proud of the progress Christopher had made. To further increase Christopher's independence, they also decided to hire a part-time caregiver who could help both of them with house chores and Christopher's personal needs. The caregiver would also provide training on how to use any tools and gadgets specifically designed for people with disabilities. As time went on, Christopher became more and more adept at using his robotic prosthetic arms and other tools. He even began exploring hobbies such as painting and woodworking, which he had never thought were possible before.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Given the background: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. and the situation: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Answer the following question: Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms? Answer:","completion":"Dee, the cousin living in the coastal town at sea level, would likely experience fewer thunderstorms as compared to Ann, who lived in a mountain village at 8,000 ft altitude. There are a few factors that contribute to this difference in thunderstorm frequency. 1. Temperature differences: As mentioned earlier, higher altitudes are generally cooler than lower altitudes due to the adiabatic lapse rate, causing a decrease in air temperature with an increase in altitude. Cooler air at higher altitudes results in a more unstable atmosphere. This instability can lead to the formation of thunderstorms, as warm air from the surface rises, cools, and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation. 2. Orographic lift: Mountains can act as barriers for air masses, forcing them to rise over the elevated terrain. As air rises along the mountain slopes, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and potentially leading to the development of thunderstorms. Ann, living in a mountain village, is more likely to experience thunderstorms due to this orographic lift effect. 3. Inversions and fog: In some cases, a temperature inversion can occur where the temperature increases with height, rather than decreasing. These inversions can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below and lead to the formation of fog. While inversions may act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development, they are more common in mountain areas like where Ann lives, resulting in an increased likelihood of fog and cloud formation, which can contribute to thunderstorm development when the inversion breaks. 4. Local climate and topography: Coastal regions like the one where Dee lives are influenced by the moderating effects of the ocean. The specific heat capacity of water is higher than that of land, making coastal areas generally more temperate and less prone to extreme temperature fluctuations that often contribute to the formation of thunderstorms. Sea breezes, formed by the temperature differences between the land and the sea, can also help to dissipate any developing thunderstorms in coastal areas. In conclusion, although thunderstorms can occur in both coastal towns and mountain villages, Dee, living in the coastal town at sea level, would generally experience fewer thunderstorms compared to Ann, living in the mountain village at 8,000 ft altitude. The combination of factors such as altitude-related temperature differences, orographic lift, inversions and fog, as well as coastal climate influences, contribute to this difference in the frequency of thunderstorms between the two locations."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - Gird (also can be known as Gopasetra in ancient times, or Gwalior region later) is a region of Madhya Pradesh state in central India.

CNF Inc. said Monday it swung to a loss in the third quarter as the result of a charge related to the planned sale of its Menlo Worldwide Forwarding unit. What best summarizes the content of the above article?","completion":"In the third quarter, CNF Inc. reported a financial loss due to a charge associated with the intended sale of its subsidiary, Menlo Worldwide Forwarding. This dismal outcome signals a shift from previously profitable performances to a period of financial struggle. The loss comes as CNF Inc. prepares to sell its Menlo Worldwide Forwarding unit, an integral part of its business portfolio. The diversion of resources towards this sale, coupled with the expense associated with this significant strategic shift, has had a pronounced negative impact on the company's financial status during the quarter. It's important to note that the intrinsic value of a business's asset, in this case, the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding unit, is usually embodied in the profitability of the company. However, different factors such as market conditions, company financial health, and strategic decisions can lead to a revaluation of these assets. This often imposes charges culminating in a financial impact, which in turn can result in reporting a loss, as for the case of CNF Inc. Additionally, the sale of business units is usually a significant strategic move. Companies often resort to such decisions either as methods to manage financial distress or to reinvest in more profitable sectors. In such scenarios, the company will often face charges in terms of asset depreciation, transaction costs, or other related financial obligations which can sway the company's financial report to a loss in the short term. But equally, it's crucial to remember that such decisions, while impacting the short-term fiscal health of a company, are often aimed at longer-term profitability and sustained growth. This strategic shake-up could offer CNF Inc. the opportunity to streamline their operations, focus on their key competencies, or invest in new areas of potential growth. It can be a calculated move designed to reconfigure and realign their business operation to a trend that promises favorable prospects. In conclusion, the article essentially reports on CNF Inc.’s financial downturn in the third quarter, primarily caused by a charge involving the impending sale of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding. This situation exhibits the complexities and fiscal influence that major strategic changes can have on a company. It underlines the necessity for companies to adapt and evolve according to the ever-changing economic conditions, despite the potential short-term financial consequences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Paragraph: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.

Article: \\"Why do we have to learn this useless thing?\\" Of all the questions I have heard from my students during my years in the classroom, this was the one most frequently asked. I would answer it by telling them about an experience I once had. It was an experience I had with a students, who I shall call Alan, early in my teaching career. When Alan was in the eighth grade, he majored in \\"trouble\\". He had studied how to be a bully and was getting his master's degree in \\"thievery\\". Every day I had my students memorize a famous saying from a great thinker. No one complained about this daily routine more than Alan -- right up to the day he was dismissed. Then I lost touch with him for five years. Then one day, he called. He told me that after being sent to juvenile prison , he hated himself so much that he had cut his wrists with a knife. He said, \\"You know what? Mr. Schlatter, as I lay there with my life running out of my body, I suddenly remembered that useless saying you made me write twenty times one day. 'There is no failure except in no longer trying.' Then it suddenly made sense to me. As long as I was alive, I wasn't a failure, but if I allowed myself to die, I would most certainly die a failure. So with my remaining strength, I called for help and started a new life.\\" At the time he had heard the saying, it as a pebble which made no sense to him. But when he needed guidance in a moment of difficulty, it had become a diamond. And so it is to you. I say, gather all the pebbles you can, and you can count on a future filled with diamonds. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sometimes the small thing in the life may become a wise guidance when we are in trouble.\\"?","completion":"From the passage, we can learn that sometimes seemingly useless or trivial information can become a valuable source of wisdom and guidance in moments of difficulty. The author emphasizes the importance of accumulating knowledge, even if it seems insignificant at the time, as it might help us when we face challenges in the future. The answer provided, \\"Sometimes the small thing in the life may become a wise guidance when we are in trouble,\\" is a valid interpretation of the lesson presented in this passage. So, yes, the answer accurately reflects the primary takeaway and the story of Alan serves as a compelling example of this idea. The pebbles that Alan collected throughout his education became diamonds when he needed them the most, ultimately saving his life and giving him another chance to make better choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

For a film about 2 very charismatic men--Castro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in. Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end. Several of the reviews I've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Shire shares rise on positive drug data The stock of Lexington-based Shire PLC rose 7.9 percent Tuesday on positive news about trials of its drug lifitegrast. Meant to treat dry-eye disease, lifitegrast has been held up for a year because the Food and Drug Administration told Shire earlier this month that it would need more data before deciding whether to approve it. The latest data showed statistically significant relief over a 12-week course of treatment for people with the disease and could boost Shire’s chances with the FDA. Chief executive Flemming Ornskov went further in an interview with Bloomberg, saying the news would boost Shire’s chances of successfully acquiring Baxalta Inc. because the deal would be partly financed with Shire stock. Shire made an unsolicited offer for Baxalta earlier this year, but Baxalta’s management insisted that it was better on its own. Shire’s stock closed at 228.07 Tuesday. The stock is down 20 percent from its July peak of 270.63.","completion":"A company called Shire made a medicine called lifitegrast to help people with dry eyes.

Roosevelt had previously issued Executive Order 6102 on April 5, 1933, which required all individuals and corporations to turn in their gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve, in exchange for U.S. dollars.

Q: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

Paris Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \\"musette\\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you set goals for weight loss in a one month period?","completion":"To set goals for weight loss in a one month period, it is important to establish a solid plan that includes a clear target, a well-balanced diet, an appropriate exercise routine, and ways to maintain motivation and monitor progress. There are several different approaches to setting weight loss goals, but let's discuss two specific solutions and determine which may be the better option: Solution 1: Setting a Specific Weight Loss Goal In this approach, you set a specific amount of weight you want to lose within the one-month period. To do this, consider the following steps: 1. Determine your current weight: Start by measuring your current weight to establish a baseline. Use a reliable and accurate scale for consistency. 2. Calculate a realistic goal: A healthy rate of weight loss is typically considered to be 1-2 pounds per week. Over a one-month period, losing 4-8 pounds is a reasonable and achievable target. This, however, may vary depending on factors such as age, gender, metabolism, and physical activity levels. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before setting a specific weight loss goal. 3. Develop a diet plan: Consult a nutritionist or use online resources to create a balanced diet plan, focusing on cutting unnecessary calories and incorporating nutrient-dense, whole foods. Track your daily caloric intake and make adjustments as needed. 4. Incorporate regular exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with strength training sessions. Choose exercises that you enjoy to make the routine more sustainable. 5. Monitor progress: Weigh yourself weekly, using the same scale and techniques to ensure consistency. Celebrate your progress but avoid getting discouraged by temporary setbacks. 6. Stay motivated: Seek support from friends, family, or online groups, and maintain accountability by keeping a diary or using a fitness app. Regularly remind yourself of your goal and visualize the benefits of achieving it. Solution 2: Focus on Behavioral Goals Instead of setting a specific weight loss number as your primary goal, you can set behavioral goals that promote a healthy lifestyle. This approach focuses on building sustainable habits that contribute to long-term weight management. Some behavioral goals could include: 1. Increasing daily physical activity: A goal of taking 10,000 steps per day or engaging in at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily can help integrate exercise into your routine. 2. Drinking more water: Aim for at least 8 cups of water per day to stay hydrated and potentially reduce feelings of hunger. 3. Cooking at home: Homemade meals can be more nutritious and lower in calories than restaurant or takeout meals. Set a goal of cooking a certain number of meals at home per week. 4. Eating mindfully: Practice mindful eating by slowing down, listening to your body's signals, and focusing on the experience of eating. 5. Developing a regular sleep pattern: Sleep can play a role in weight management, so aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night and establish a regular sleep schedule. 6. Reducing stress: Manage stress through mindfulness meditation, yoga, hobbies, or other activities that you find soothing and relaxing. When comparing these two solutions, it is important to consider your personal preferences, motivations, and habits. Solution 1 offers a more focused target by using a specific weight loss goal, which can be motivating and provide a clear measure of success. However, this approach can sometimes result in feelings of disappointment if the target is not met. Solution 2, on the other hand, promotes long-term lifestyle changes and shifts the focus from weight loss alone to overall well-being. This approach can lead to sustainable habits and potentially result in weight loss over time, without the pressure of reaching a specific number within a short timeframe. This can also increase the chances of maintaining weight loss over the long term. In conclusion, while both solutions have their merits, Solution 2 (focusing on behavioral goals) may be a better overall approach for setting weight loss goals in a one-month period. This method shifts the focus to sustainable lifestyle changes and overall well-being, leading to healthier habits that can last beyond the one-month period. Ultimately, the choice between these solutions will depend on your personal preferences and what resonates more with your motivations and goals."},{"prompt":"Question: Q: What is the process by which plants gain energy and produce sugar?

Answer:","completion":"New York is located in the Eastern Time Zone (ET) of the United States, which is also abbreviated as EST (Eastern Standard Time) during the standard time and EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) during the daylight saving time. The Eastern Time Zone covers a large portion of the United States' eastern seaboard, including not only the state of New York, but also other densely populated states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Florida, as well as parts of eastern Canada. The time zone is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), commonly known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Eastern Standard Time is UTC-5, meaning it is five hours behind Coordinated Universal Time. During daylight saving time, the clock is advanced by one hour, resulting in Eastern Daylight Time being UTC-4. Daylight saving time in the United States usually begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. During this period, the clocks are advanced by one hour to take advantage of the increased daylight hours in the evening. This practice facilitates energy conservation by reducing the need for artificial lighting and heating during those hours. To conclude, New York follows the Eastern Time Zone, which is split into Eastern Standard Time (EST) when observing standard time and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when observing daylight saving time. The time difference between New York and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is either minus five hours (UTC-5) during standard time or minus four hours (UTC-4) during daylight saving time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was cleaned every day, but it was always full of water and pee by morning. Where is the bathroom located? Options: - school - at hotel - neighbor's house - college - flat Explain why a human would choose \\"school\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons. While all of the options listed could potentially have a dirty and messy bathroom, a school is more likely to have such issues due to a few contributing factors. 1. High foot traffic: School bathrooms experience a large number of users every day, as students, teachers, and staff all use these facilities. This high volume of foot traffic increases the likelihood of water and pee accumulating on a daily basis despite regular cleaning. 2. Young users: A significant portion of the individuals using school bathrooms may be young children or teenagers. These younger users might not have the same level of personal hygiene and cleanliness habits as adults, leading to a greater potential for messiness in the bathroom. 3. Limited supervision: In a school setting, bathrooms tend to have limited direct supervision. This lack of oversight can lead to some users not taking responsibility for their actions, resulting in a messier bathroom environment. 4. Vandalism and pranks: School bathrooms can unfortunately be a common site for vandalism and prank activities, further contributing to their uncleanliness. These occurrences can make it difficult to maintain a clean and hygienic environment, even with daily cleaning. 5. Insufficient resources: Schools can sometimes face budget constraints, leading to inadequate resources for maintaining clean bathrooms. Limited staff or cleaning supplies can make it challenging to keep up with the high demand for cleaning services in these facilities. In contrast, a hotel, neighbor's house, college, or flat may have different dynamics that make it less likely for a bathroom to remain dirty and messy despite daily cleaning. For example, a hotel might have a dedicated housekeeping team that ensures cleanliness, while an individual's house or flat would have fewer users and therefore, less possibility for messiness. A college bathroom might experience similar issues as a school, but it can be argued that adult users at a college may have a higher level of personal responsibility and maturity, potentially resulting in less accumulation of water and pee on a daily basis. In summary, a human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question based on the likelihood of a school bathroom experiencing high foot traffic, having younger users, experiencing limited supervision, being subjected to vandalism or pranks, and potentially facing insufficient resources for maintenance. These factors make school bathrooms more prone to being dirty and messy despite daily cleaning efforts."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

Article:","completion":"Title: Combating Seasonal Allergies: Practical Tips for Relief Introduction Seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, affect millions of people every year. They are caused by an overreaction of the immune system to pollen and other allergens found in the environment. For many, this overreaction can result in sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and a runny or stuffy nose. While there is no permanent cure for seasonal allergies, several strategies can be implemented to help manage the symptoms and make life more comfortable for those who suffer from them. In this article, we will discuss the importance of wearing a mask, monitoring pollen counts, removing wet leaves from your yard, and avoiding ragweed as effective ways to combat seasonal allergies. 1. Wear a Mask Wearing a mask, especially during peak allergy season, can be an effective way to reduce the inhalation of pollen and other allergens that cause seasonal allergies. Masks can filter out large particles, such as pollen, dust, and mold spores, which can significantly reduce the amount of allergens entering your respiratory system. When choosing a mask, opt for one that is specifically designed for allergy protection. These masks usually have a higher filtration efficiency and are made of materials that are designed to prevent allergens from entering your nose and mouth. Make sure the mask fits snugly around your face, and change it regularly to maintain its effectiveness. 2. Monitor Pollen Counts Keeping an eye on pollen counts in your area can help you anticipate when your allergy symptoms may be worse and take appropriate preventive measures. Pollen counts are typically highest between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m., and on warm, dry, and windy days. You can check your local pollen count through several sources, including the National Allergy Bureau, local news broadcasts, or various mobile apps available for your smartphone. When pollen counts are high, try to stay indoors as much as possible, avoid outdoor activities during peak times, and close your windows and doors to prevent allergens from entering your home. 3. Remove Wet Leaves from Your Yard Wet, damp leaves can be a breeding ground for mold spores, which can cause allergy symptoms in some individuals. It is important to be proactive in removing wet leaves from your yard, especially during the fall season when leaves are more likely to accumulate and create damp conditions. Regularly raking and disposing of leaves can help to reduce the amount of mold spores present in your yard and minimize your exposure to this allergen. In addition, removing wet leaves can also improve the overall appearance and cleanliness of your property. 4. Avoid Ragweed Ragweed is one of the most common causes of seasonal allergies, and its pollen is responsible for triggering allergic reactions in many individuals. To minimize your exposure to ragweed pollen, make an effort to identify and remove any ragweed plants growing in your yard or garden. Ragweed has a distinct appearance, with green, feathery leaves and small green or white flowers. You can also implement strategies to help prevent ragweed from growing in your yard, such as planting a barrier of native, allergy-friendly plants around your property. Conclusion Seasonal allergies can be frustrating and uncomfortable, but by implementing these strategies, you can help to minimize your exposure to allergens and reduce the severity of your symptoms. Wearing a mask, monitoring pollen counts, removing wet leaves from your yard, and avoiding ragweed can all contribute to a more comfortable allergy season. In addition to these practical tips, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and explore additional treatment options that can help you manage your seasonal allergies effectively. Remember, the key to combating seasonal allergies is to be proactive and take control of your environment to create a healthier, happier, and more allergy-free lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots. The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them. Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character. In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log. \\"While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,\\" he said. The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen.

She had wrinkles on her cheeks and white hair on her head, which showed that she had lived a long life. This woman had a husband, who was also old. They had been together for a very, very long time, and had shared many happy memories. One day, something very sad and unexpected happened. The woman's husband died. The people in the town were very confused and wanted to know what happened to the old man. They thought that maybe the woman had something to do with her husband's death. So, the town's people decided to take the woman to a place called \\"court.\\" The court is like a big room where people go when they need help figuring out if someone did something wrong. In the court, there is a person called a \\"judge\\" who listens to everything that happened and then decides what should be done.

The people in the court wanted to know if the woman had \\"murdered\\" her husband. This is a very serious word, and it means that someone has purposely caused the death of another person. The woman listened as the judge asked her many questions about what had happened. She tried to explain that she loved her husband and would never hurt him. Other people in the court also spoke and shared what they knew about the woman and her husband.

But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee. Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them.

A study released Tuesday in Nature Communications concludes that the Macrauchenia patachonica, or the \\"long-necked llama,\\" is part of a sister group of the Perissodactyla placental order, which includes horses and rhinos. The two groups split about 66 million years ago, reports the AFP, right about the time a massive asteroid struck the Earth, causing the extinction of land-roaming dinosaurs. Macrauchenia, which looked like camels without humps and weighed up to 1,000 pounds, lived in what is now South America until the late Pleistocene Era, between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago. \\"Its outstanding feature, however, was its nose,\\" says study co-author and American Museum of Natural History curator Ross McPhee. \\"We have no soft tissue fossils,\\" he continues, \\"so we don't know whether the nose was developed into an actual trunk, like an elephant's. It would not have looked very much like anything alive today.\\" The new study built on a 2015 study that attempted to determine the animal's lineage through the analysis of ancient collagen, the structural protein found in skin. CNN reports that McPhee and University of Potsdam paleogenomics expert Michi Hofreiter extracted mitochondrial DNA from a Macrauchenia fossil found in South America and employed new techniques in genome recovery, which together allowed them to identify the animal's origins without the DNA of close relatives. Darwin was the first to find the animal's fossils, while in Patagonia in 1834, but neither he nor Richard Owen, the renowned paleontologist he sent the fossils to, was able to place the creature in any known lineage. (As for the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, it hit in exactly the wrong place.) Article:","completion":"Imagine an animal so strange that even the very smart scientist named Charles Darwin, who taught us a lot about animals and how they change over time, couldn't figure out where it belonged among all the creatures in the world. This animal is called Macrauchenia patachonica, but we can just call it the \\"long-necked llama.\\" It sounds a bit funny because it sort of looked like a llama with a very long neck, but also like a camel without humps, and it was quite heavy too, like a big horse! But even though it looked like those animals, we just learned from a big study that its true family members might actually be creatures like horses and rhinos. Scientists think that they all had a common family a long, long time ago -- about 66 million years! That's around the time when a huge space rock crashed into the Earth and made the big dinosaurs go away forever. The long-necked llama, which lived in what is now South America, was known for its very big nose. However, scientists aren't sure what it looked like exactly because they only have the hard parts of the llama left, like bones, and not the soft parts like the skin or nose. Maybe it had a trunk, like an elephant! To find out more about where this strange animal came from, two clever researchers named Ross Mcphee and Michi Hofreiter used very tiny pieces from the inside of a long-necked llama bone that had been buried a long time ago. Even though they didn't have DNA (which is like a tiny instruction book inside every living thing) from its close animal relatives, they managed to figure out that the long-necked llama belonged to the same big animal group as horses and rhinos. Funny thing is, Charles Darwin was the first person to find a long-necked llama fossil while he was traveling in a place called Patagonia in 1834. He even sent his findings to a very important bone expert named Richard Owen, but even with their big brains, they couldn't figure out where this weird mammal fit in the big folder of all known animals.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: In what year did market-based economic reforms take place in the country that expanded its economy in the 17th century under the Mughal Empire? , can you please find it? India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country.... A:","completion":"The market-based economic reforms in India, the country that expanded its economy in the 17th century under the Mughal Empire, took place in the year 1991. These economic reforms marked a pivotal time in the history of India's economy. Prior to 1991, India exhibited characteristics of a closed economy, as it relied primarily on its internal markets and sought to minimize its interaction with the global economic order. In an attempt to achieve self-sustained growth and protect its economy from external volatility, India had high tariffs and import licensing, a prohibition on foreign direct investment, and a complex system of regulations and permissions known as the \\"License Raj.\\" Seeing the imperative need for change, Indian government leaders instituted a series of market-based economic reforms in 1991. This move towards liberalization, privatization, and globalization, often referred to as the LPG model, was a significant departure from the previous economic pattern of planning and control. Major reforms involved the reduction of import tariffs, the removal of import licensing, the deregulation of markets, and the encouragement of foreign direct investment. There was an introduction of competition in markets that were previously controlled by the government. Additionally, restrictions on private companies were abolished to foster competition, thereby resulting in a surge of economic growth. These significant economic changes helped India to become one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a newly industrialized country. By 2017, the Indian economy emerged as the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Therefore, the year 1991 is significant in the history of India's economy as it launched a new trajectory of growth by embarking on a path of market-based economic reforms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the village square in an arson attack and their cats likewise attack the village mice.

Stress needs to be managed in order to prevent anxiety . Here are some tips on how to manage stress. Write it out Write down everything that seems stressful, and ways to deal with each problem. You'll find a things-to-do list much easier to manage than having all messed up in your head. Write down the tasks along with the specific times when you can do them. One task at a time Give each task all your attention while you're doing it, and forget the rest. This will keep you from feeling anxious about things you have left to do. Thinking about other tasks only adds unnecessary stress, and can even stop you from doing the task you're busy with at present. You don't need to do everything all at once, or on your own. The feeling of being pressed to finish something on time will somehow disappear if someone is there to help you. Give yourself a reward Rewarding yourself for what you've already done, no matter how small, is a great way to motivate yourself to keep going. It will reduce stress, and make you happier to go on with the next task. Give yourself a break Breaks of ten to fifteen minutes are important. Visit a cafe or take a quick walk --anything to take your mind off the work for a while. If you need to stay at work, sit with your eyes closed and imagine a peaceful place or some other relaxing scenes. This will remove the stress from your muscles and mind.

Summarize this article: Letterkenny Circuit Court was told on Monday that the dispute between Mick Hucknall and Chris De Margary of Simply Red, and John Wilde had been resolved. The terms of the agreement were confidential. Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary bought Glenmore Lodge near Ballybofey in 2005 for an estimated 1.3m euros ( Â£1.09m). They have since run the Glenmore Rivers Sporting Estate there. However, in December 2009, the Simply Red members went to court claiming that a neighbour, Mr Wilde of Cloghan Lodge, had been interfering with the sporting rights to lands surrounding their lodge. Mr Wilde said the previous owners of Glenmore transferred those rights to his father. However, Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary said they bought all the sporting rights when they purchased Glenmore Lodge from Thomas Mackie and alleged Mr Wilde had been interfering with and had laid claim to those rights since that time. A full hearing of the case had been due to begin at Letterkenny Circuit Court on Monday, but after a number of hours of talks, legal representatives told Judge John O'Hagan that agreement had been reached. Judge O'Hagan congratulated both parties on coming to an agreement and said it was the sensible thing to do. Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary were not in court.

In 3rd party launchers it doesn't allow to create shortcuts in app drawers so please allow us to create homescreen widgets with this app.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? The answer is:","completion":"Maybe. The mentioned review suggests that certain features (such as creating widgets) could be improved, specifically when using 3rd party launchers, which might impact users' experience with the application. However, it is important to consider several factors before making a recommendation to a friend. These factors include personal preferences, the overall functionality of the app, their experience with launchers, reviews from other users, and the significance of the widgets feature to their usage. 1. Personal Preferences: It is essential to factor in the friend's needs and preferences, as what may be a drawback to one person might not matter to another. If the friend is particular about using widgets, then this app might not be their first choice, especially if using a 3rd party launcher. However, if they don't find this restriction significant, then the app could be suitable for them. 2. Overall Functionality: Gauge the general performance of the app, apart from the mentioned feature. If the app provides excellent other features, you may still consider recommending it, despite the widget creation limitations. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of the app and determine if the mentioned drawback outweighs its advantages. 3. Experience with Launchers: Evaluate the friend's experience with using app launchers, specifically 3rd party ones. If they tend to use default launchers, the mentioned issue may not be relevant to them. 4. Reviews from Other Users: To make a well-informed decision, analyze feedback from other users in addition to the mentioned review. Look for patterns in user issues and see if a general consensus highlights certain pros or cons. The more opinions and experiences you can consider, the better you can gauge whether the app will be suitable for your friend. 5. Significance of Widgets: Determine how essential widgets are in the friend's app usage. If they rely heavily on widgets, they may find the app restrictive. On the other hand, if they rarely use widgets, the mentioned issue might not be a significant concern. In conclusion, recommending this app to a friend depends on various factors, including the individual's preferences, overall app functionality, familiarity with third-party launchers, and the importance of widgets to their app usage. Carefully consider all these aspects before making a decision, and take time to evaluate other options available on the market.

Well, that's what some people are saying about a new movie called Money Never Sleeps. It's a sequel, which means it's the second part of another movie called Wall Street, made in 1987. In that movie, a character named Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, said, \\"Greed is good.\\" That quote became really famous! The person who made both movies is Oliver Stone, a famous film director. Some critics, who are people that watch movies and then tell others what they think, say that this time, Stone put too many things into his movie. It's like he was trying to tell too many stories at once, and that made it a bit confusing. However, one really good thing in the movie is Michael Douglas, who plays Gordon Gekko again. He is really great at being a slimy ex-con stock trader, which means he used to do bad things with money but now he's out of jail. The critics like his performance, and they say he is \\"nasty fun.\\" Even though there are problems with the movie, some people still enjoyed it. Richard Corliss from Time magazine says it has the style and humor of a really great Hollywood movie. But in the end, the movie could have been tougher on the world of money and business.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: Where is Mount Washburn? , can you please find it? As wildfire is a natural part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines—the most common tree species in the park—generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people—in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should...

This collaboration aims to enhance the tourist attraction of the city and offer high-quality amenities to visitors. The partnership between private investors and the Samokov authorities is expected to be mutually beneficial, as the private sector can provide the necessary financial resources and expertise in the field of ski resort development, while the municipal government can facilitate the approval process and potentially contribute to the infrastructure and promotion of the city. The new ski slopes and ski lift will be designed in accordance with the latest international standards, ensuring safety, comfort, and enjoyment for tourists of all skill levels. Additionally, these new facilities are expected to positively impact the local economy by attracting more visitors to Samokov, creating new job opportunities, and increasing demand for accommodations, restaurants, and auxiliary services in the area. The success of this joint venture will largely depend on effective communication, coordination, and cooperation between the private investors and the municipal officials of Samokov. Both parties should share the common goal of creating a top-notch winter attraction that benefits the local community and contributes to the sustainable development of the region. To achieve this ambitious goal, the private investors and the municipal government should consider the following steps: 1. Conduct thorough market research to identify the target audience's preferences, needs, and expectations for ski resort amenities. 2. Engage experienced professionals in ski resort planning, engineering, and construction to ensure the highest quality of the planned ski slopes and ski lift. 3. Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote the newly constructed facilities both domestically and internationally. 4.

Efan al-Essawi, Iraqi Lawmaker and Sunni Leader, Killed in Bombing BAGHDAD — An Iraqi Parliament member who was also the leader of a local council of the Awakening movement, an American-backed group of Sunni militias that switched sides to fight against Al Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Anbar Province on Tuesday, security and government officials said. The lawmaker, Efan al-Essawi, who owned a construction company, had gone to inspect a road that it was building to connect Falluja with the main highway in Anbar, a trade route that leads west to Syria and Jordan. The region has been embroiled in strife since last month, when protests, led mostly by Sunnis, broke out against the Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The demonstrations continued in Anbar on Tuesday. Officials said that the suicide attacker, disguised as a worker, approached Mr. Essawi and blew himself up, killing Mr. Essawi and wounding one of his guards. Mr. Essawi had escaped many assassination attempts before. In 2009, attackers placed a magnetic bomb on the armored car that he was using when he was a candidate for Parliament, the first attack on a candidate as those elections approached. He avoided serious injury in that episode. The province called for three days of mourning for Mr. Essawi, a prominent local figure, and members of his largely Sunni bloc of lawmakers, Iraqiya, boycotted a session of Parliament in protest over the inability of the government to respond to the demands of the demonstrators and its failure to provide adequate security. “Today our ministers have boycotted the session in the cabinet, as they want to send a message to say that we are closer to the street, not the government,” Leqa Mahdi, a member of Iraqiya from Anbar Province, said in a telephone interview. “This boycott will continue until the government responds to the demands of the demonstrators, until the parties sit down and find real solutions for the current crisis.” It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack on Mr. Essawi, but one of his close associates said he had seen in a text message a threat by Al Qaeda against Mr. Essawi that said, “We will kill you even if it was the last day on earth.” The assassination comes as Iraq grapples with political turmoil. A raid last month by security forces on the office and home of the Sunni finance minister, Rafe al-Essawi, and the arrest of 10 bodyguards inflamed tempers and stirred charges that Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, was monopolizing power and marginalizing Sunnis ahead of provincial elections scheduled for April. Rafe al-Essawi is not related to Efan al-Essawi. Over the past few weeks, thousands of Sunnis have staged protests, mostly in Anbar, to show their anger against the government. They and senior opposition politicians have made repeated calls for Mr. Maliki to resign. Iraqi government television reported that Mr. Maliki said Tuesday that the killers of the lawmaker would be tracked down and punished. Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This news story is about an important person named Efan al-Essawi from Iraq, who was a leader and helped make decisions for his country.

Having won the first leg 2-0, United joined Southampton in the final - to be played at Wembley on 26 February - with a 3-2 aggregate success. But Mourinho refused to acknowledge Hull had scored a penalty during the second leg at the KCOM Stadium. \\"I only saw two goals,\\" said the Portuguese. \\"It was 1-1.\\" Hull went in front on the night through a penalty from Tom Huddlestone. Replays showed two tussles in the area as the visitors defended a corner - Phil Jones tangling with Oumar Niasse, and Marcos Rojo briefly holding the shirt of Harry Maguire - and referee Jon Moss awarded the spot-kick. United levelled through Paul Pogba, only for Niasse to give Hull victory. Mourinho said: \\"I saw the Pogba goal and their goal was a fantastic goal - great action, great cross and the guy coming in at the far post. 1-1.\\" The defeat ended United's 17-match unbeaten run, and Mourinho's frustration was clear as he walked out of a television interview after about 30 seconds. \\"I behaved on the bench, no sending-off, no punishment so no more words,\\" Mourinho, on his 54th birthday, told Sky Sports. \\"To speak about the performance, I have to speak about things I don't want to speak about because the game was totally under control - the game was dead. \\"The game was totally under control and something happened to open the game.\\" Mourinho said he did not believe United would be favourites when they meet Southampton next month. \\"It doesn't matter where we play,\\" said Mourinho. \\"I don't think we are favourites against nobody.\\" Despite his frustration, Mourinho now has the chance to win the League Cup for a fourth time, equalling the record held by former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and ex-Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough.

The Eagles responded in the second quarter with a one-yard touchdown pass from Carson Wentz to Ryan Mathews, cutting the Lions lead to seven points. The Lions added to their lead with a one-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Marvin Jones. The Eagles responded with a 50-yard field goal from Caleb Sturgis, which made the score 21-10 in favor of the Lions at halftime. The Eagles scored 10 points in the third quarter via a one-yard touchdown pass from Wentz to Josh Huff, and a 33-yard field goal from Sturgis, cutting the Lions lead to one point. The Eagles took their first lead of the game, going up 23-21 in the fourth quarter on a 49-yard field goal from Sturgis. At the 2:34 mark of the final quarter, Darius Slay forced a Ryan Mathews fumble, which the Lions recovered inside Eagles territory. This was Philadelphia's first turnover of the 2016 season.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator? from the following article ? (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy...

The given sentence in German, \\"Dies wäre das erste Mal, dass das vor kurzem vom Parlament in Simbabwe angenommene Gesetz zum Informationszugang Anwendung findet,\\" translates to \\"This would be the first time that the recently adopted Access to Information Act by the Parliament in Zimbabwe would be applied\\" in English. The Access to Information Act is a piece of legislation that was recently passed by the Parliament in Zimbabwe. The aim of this act is to provide the public with greater access to information held by public bodies and to promote transparency and accountability. With the passage of this law, Zimbabwe is taking a step toward embracing democratic values and principles, as access to information is critical in empowering citizens to participate effectively in all aspects of society. Under this legislation, citizens will have the right to request information from public bodies, which will be required to provide responses within a specified timeframe. This can help to prevent corruption or the misuse of public resources by ensuring that public officials are held accountable for their actions. It also promotes a culture of openness and transparency, which is essential for building trust between government and citizens. However, the successful implementation of the Access to Information Act in Zimbabwe will also depend on the government's commitment to enforcing the law and ensuring that public officials comply with its provisions. This may require the government to invest in training and capacity-building initiatives to ensure that public officials are aware of their responsibilities under the Act and have the necessary skills to respond to information requests. Additionally, establishing an independent oversight body could also help to ensure that the Act is implemented effectively and that any complaints or disputes that arise in relation to information requests are resolved fairly and impartially. In summary, this newly adopted Access to Information Act in Zimbabwe marks an important step towards strengthening democracy and accountability in the country. By providing citizens with greater access to information, the Act can help to empower individuals to better engage in the political process and demand accountability from public officials. However, the Act's effectiveness will also depend on the government's commitment to its implementation and willingness to invest in the necessary resources to ensure that public officials are able to respond effectively to information requests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every cat doesn't like mice, for example Felix doesn't. Choose from: +unacceptable; +acceptable;","completion":"A linguist would likely find the sentence \\"Every cat doesn't like mice, for example Felix doesn't.\\" to be unacceptable as a valid English sentence grammatically. Let's break down the sentence and identify the reasons why it might be considered unacceptable. 1. Ambiguity: The main issue with the sentence is that it can be interpreted in two different ways: a) The intended meaning is probably that not every cat likes mice, and Felix is an example of such a cat. In this case, the sentence should be rephrased to: \\"Not every cat likes mice; for example, Felix doesn't.\\" b) The other possible interpretation is that every cat dislikes mice, and Felix is just another cat that shares this universal dislike. This interpretation is highly unlikely, and the provided sentence doesn't convey this meaning effectively. To state this, it would be better to use: \\"All cats dislike mice, and Felix is no exception.\\" 2. Punctuation and Comma Usage: There are issues with the use of commas in the sentence. The comma after \\"mice\\" should ideally be replaced with a semicolon to properly separate and emphasize the two independent clauses in the sentence. Furthermore, there should be a comma between \\"example\\" and \\"Felix\\" to set off the introductory phrase. Given these issues, the sentence would be considered unacceptable grammatically. A more acceptable version of the sentence, following the improvements suggested above, would read: \\"Not every cat likes mice; for example, Felix doesn't.\\" This revision eliminates the ambiguity and corrects the punctuation, resulting in a sentence that is more likely to be deemed grammatically acceptable by a linguist."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

This way, when you market your tutoring to someone else, you can provide the potential client with a list of references they can contact to learn about the quality of your teaching skills and methods. Do not include clients’ contact information unless they provide their consent. Reaching out to teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, sports coaches, and advisors is a great way to promote your tutoring services. If you make a good impression, these individuals can refer students in need. For example, if you specialize in teaching elementary school students to read, contact the elementary school teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, or advisors in your area. An introductory email with a copy of your references and resume is a good way to start the dialogue if you do not know the people you are contacting. Since many schools have strict visitor policies, it is best not to drop by unannounced. If you are hoping to find tutoring positions in your community, events such as festivals, fairs, and parades offer important networking opportunities. If there are school-sponsored events open to the public, try to visit these since there will likely be many students and families in attendance who may be interested in your tutoring services. Sporting events, for example, are often open to the public. Offer to make a presentation at a school or community event such as a PTA meeting or service club. Make sure you bring some of your business cards, flyers, and brochures to these events so you can promote your services if the subject comes up in conversation. Posting flyers and handing out business cards promoting your tutoring services will help you find tutoring jobs. As a precaution, ask permission before posting your materials, but here are some ideas for ideal locations in your community: Your neighborhood. School bus stops. Sporting arenas or fields. Public parks. Community bulletin boards. Public libraries. School bulletin boards or hallways. Coffee shops. Bookstores. Stores and restaurants close to schools or campuses. If you are planning to work independently as a tutor instead of working for a company, learning center, or school, you may want to create a website to advertise your tutoring services. A website will help you seem more established and professional, and you will likely receive job requests. Be sure to include your resume, contact information, a list of subjects you are prepared to tutor, and testimonials from past or current clients. Use social media accounts to spread the word about your tutoring services and recruit new clients. Remember, if you are hoping to find tutoring jobs, you need to keep the content of your accounts and posts professional and focused on tutoring. If you are hoping to tutor privately, consider advertising tutoring discounts, contests, or specials using social media. This should help attract new clients and promote your tutoring services.","completion":"To find a tutoring job, you can ask students and their parents to tell their friends about your tutoring.

But after 2-3 months the 'browning' dial suddenly stopped functioning so that - even at the lowest setting - the bread would keep on toasting till it turned black and smoky, and even then kept going till unplugged.

Answer:","completion":"The year 1972 can be considered a life-changing year for both Brent Hodge and Puttanna Kanagal, as it marked significant milestones in their personal lives and professional careers, even though they had achieved those milestones in completely different domains and contexts. Brent Hodge, a Canadian actor, comedian, and filmmaker, was born in this year, on June 4, 1972, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This year laid the foundation for Hodge's eventual career in comedy, acting, and filmmaking. Throughout his career, Hodge has been widely recognized for his documentaries that explore different facets of society and popular culture, including Key West: Trouble in Paradise (2006) and Comedy Jam (2010). In addition, Hodge has worked on various television shows and film projects such as Anthem (2006), The Buried Life (2007), and Eagles in Drag (2010). This year marked the beginning of the life-changing journey for Brent Hodge, who has made a name for himself in the film industry and contributed significantly to shaping the entertainment landscape ever since. On the other hand, 1972 was also a pivotal year for an Indian film director, Puttanna Kanagal. Born on December 1, 1933, in Kanagal, Karnataka, India, Kanagal had already made a name for himself by 1972 through his strong storytelling and filmmaking skills. This year witnessed the release of one of his most exemplary films, Naagarahaavu (Cobra, 1972), which marked a turning point in the Kannada film industry. Naagarahaavu was a critical and commercial success, earning numerous accolades, including the Karnataka State Film Award for Second Best Film. This film also introduced legendary actor Vishnuvardhan, who went on to become one of the most revered actors in the history of Kannada cinema. The film's ensemble cast, powerful storyline, and compelling characters resonated deeply with the audience and etched Puttanna Kanagal's name in the annals of Indian cinema. In conclusion, 1972 was a life-changing year for both Brent Hodge and Puttanna Kanagal, albeit in different capacities. While it marked the inception of Brent Hodge's journey as a comedian, actor, and filmmaker, it also solidified Puttanna Kanagal's place among the pantheon of great Indian film directors through the success of Naagarahaavu. Both individuals have since left indelible marks on the world of entertainment and filmmaking, influencing and inspiring countless others along the way."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

A list is shown by two brackets and comma-separated numbers and characters inside, like ['1', '12', 'l']. You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: LONDON — Britain’s most infamous defender of Islamist extremism was found guilty of eliciting support for the Islamic State, officials said Tuesday, marking what authorities described as a milestone in the British campaign to combat homegrown terrorism. The verdict against Anjem Choudary, 49, is the first major conviction against a man seen across Europe as a Pied Piper for young radicals and a cheerleader for the Islamic State. His conviction immediately became the most significant example of how Britain and other European nations are moving to expand their counterterrorism operations, targeting not just active cells but also the voices of incitement. A top associate of Choudary — Mohammed Rahman, 33 — was also convicted, and both now face up to 10 years of jail time. The verdict came after years in which both men had mostly dodged British justice, doing so by successfully playing the same democratic system they often railed against. [In Britain, Islamist extremist Anjem Choudary proves elusive] Choudary is a trained lawyer, and maintained that his polemics — he called for strict Islamic law in Britain and turning Buckingham Palace into a mosque — were expressions of free speech designed to “bait” the British press. His conviction, however, came after he appeared to cross a line by openly supporting the Islamic State. In lectures and statements posted on social media and YouTube, he encouraged youths to embrace the Islamic State and denied its documented war atrocities, prosecutors said. In one piece of vital evidence, officials said, he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader in a conversation with a convicted Islamic State recruiter. “These two men knowingly sought to legitimize a terrorist organization and encouraged others to support it,” Sue Hemming, head of counterterrorism for the Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement. “They used the power of social media to attempt to influence those who are susceptible to these types of messages, which might include the young or vulnerable.” The men were convicted on June 28, but the verdict was announced Tuesday, after the conclusion of a related trial. They are set for sentencing on Sept. 6. Counterterrorism officials and experts have long described Choudary — a soft-spoken orator with a salt-and-pepper beard known for wearing traditional Muslim robes — as a leading figure in the dark networks across Europe that have fostered homegrown extremism and encouraged young Muslims to fight in the Middle East. “These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counterterrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organizations,” Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command. [Britain’s anti-terrorism strategy tested by move against prominent preacher] Choudary, however, has described a crusade against him by authorities. \\"If I had even sent one person abroad, really sent them abroad, if they could link that to me, then surely I would have been in court under the anti-terrorism legislation a long time ago,\\" Choudary told Sky News last month. \\"If you look at my speeches, I have said the same thing for 20 years. For me, it is a matter of worship.” Yet authorities say that looking at his speeches -- and more -- is precisely what led to his conviction. During the investigation, Haydon said, 20 years’ worth of material was considered. They included information recovered from 333 electronic devices containing 12.1 terabytes of storage data. In a meeting in a restaurant in July 2014, Choudary and Rahman used Skype and phone texts to contact Mohammed Fachry, a man convicted of recruiting for the Islamic State in Indonesia, and pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The oath, signed by Choudary, was promptly published by Fachry on an Indonesian website, police said. Via social and traditional media, Choudary has openly defended known terrorists and called for the spread of Islamic law. His comments often harbored an air of the grandiose, leaving some wondering whether he was a publicity hound more than anything else. “We believe there will be complete domination of the world by Islam,” he told The Washington Post in 2014. “That may sound like some kind of James Bond movie — you know, Dr. No and world domination and all that. But we believe it.” But over the past 15 years, counterterrorism experts say, the majority of Britons convicted of offenses related to Islamic extremism have been members or supporters of his shadowy organizations. They included the two men charged with slaughtering Lee Rigby, a British army soldier killed on the streets of London in May 2013. Yet other than a minor charge for holding an illegal demonstration, a series of allegations against Choudary never really stuck. In September, 2014, however, exasperated British authorities arrested Choudary and Rahman after mounting their most rigorous case against them of \\"inviting support\\" of the Islamic State. Officials focused intensely on their web casts. \\"The lesson...is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia,\\" Choudary says in one audio clip -- since taken down from the Internet -- according to the Guardian. \\"And to obey them obviously means they must be established.\\" A detailed report compiled on Choudary by Hate Not Hope, a British anti-extremist organization, portrays Choudary as a sinister but savvy figure with deep connections to extremism. Well over 100 Britons with some connection to Choudary and his al-Muhajiroun network have gone to Syria to fight, the group said. Choudary has disputed that he ever coaxed jihadists to go and fight. But he routinely painted the Islamic State as a religious utopia. “If you look now in the area controlled by the Islamic State, the Jews, the Muslims and the Christians are living side by side in security,” he once told the Guardian. “It’s not true that people are being slaughtered. Those people who are allied with the previous regime or those who are fighting against the Muslims, certainly they will be fought against.” Choudary also maintained early and long ties with a host of other radical groups across Europe, including Sharia4Belgium. That group is now labeled a terrorist organization in Belgium, and authorities see it as an incubator of homegrown terror and young jihadists who have joined the Islamic State. “It seems incredulous that he was allowed to continue all these years,” said Nick Lowles, executive director of Hope Not Hate, a British anti-extremist organization. “This really does put an end to his organization. Others will try to step into his place. But the people who come after him won’t have the same credibility or media profile.” Karla Adam contributed to this report.

Irfon defines the northern border of the Builth Wells area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Mynydd Epynt .","completion":"Yes, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same general meaning, which is the role of the Irfon in defining the northern boundary of a particular area. However, there are a few differences in the structure and word choice between the two sentences, which are essential aspects of paraphrasing. Let's analyze these differences: Original sentence: \\"The Irfon defines the northern limit of the Mynydd Epynt area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Builth Wells.\\" Paraphrased sentence: \\"Irfon defines the northern border of the Builth Wells area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Mynydd Epynt.\\" 1. In the original sentence, the definite article \\"the\\" is used before \\"Irfon,\\" whereas it is omitted in the paraphrased sentence. This is a minor change, but it helps to highlight that the sentences are not identical. 2. The original sentence describes the northern limit as \\"the northern limit of the Mynydd Epynt area.\\" In the paraphrased sentence, it is described as \\"the northern border of the Builth Wells area.\\" This change involves using \\"border\\" instead of \\"limit\\" and changing the focus area's name that is limited by Irfon from \\"Mynydd Epynt\\" to \\"Builth Wells.\\" Although the terms and the focus area changed, the overall meaning remains the same, considering that both sentences still point out the northern boundary defined by the Irfon. 3. The order of the locations \\"Llanwrtyd Wells,\\" \\"Builth Wells,\\" and \\"Mynydd Epynt\\" is changed between the two sentences, but their relationship remains the same. In both cases, the Irfon defines the northern boundary between two locations, highlighting the same geographic connection between these places. In conclusion, the two sentences are indeed paraphrases, as they communicate the same essential information about the Irfon defining a northern boundary between specific locations, despite the differences in structure and word choice.

Answer:","completion":"Ludwig Wenz was a German footballer who was born on August 24, 1906. He achieved notable success and recognition in his career, primarily playing as a goalkeeper. Despite facing many challenges throughout his life, Wenz's achievements on and off the field leave a lasting legacy and impact on the world of football. Wenz's passion for football began at a young age, and over time, he honed his skills, particularly in the goalkeeping position. His talent and determination led him to be part of Germany's national football team. He played for his national team during the 1930s, a time when the world was facing significant changes, and international sports competitions served as a platform for countries to showcase their athletic prowess. Ludwig Wenz had the honor of wearing the national colors for Germany during the early stages of his career. He made his debut for the national team in 1930, earning his first and only national cap. A national cap refers to an appearance made by a player for their national team in an official match. This achievement was a testament to Wenz's exceptional skills as a goalkeeper and a source of pride for both him and his country. As a goalkeeper, Wenz's primary role was to prevent the opposing team from scoring goals. Throughout his international career, he did not score any goals. This is not unusual for goalkeepers, as their main focus is on defending their team's goal rather than scoring. Apart from his achievements on the field, Ludwig Wenz's life was marked by personal milestones. He was born in the early 20th century, a time of rapid industrialization and social change. Throughout his life, he witnessed numerous historical events that shaped the world, such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the beginnings of the Cold War. Wenz’s football career spanned several years, playing in various clubs and his valuable contribution to German football was not limited to his time with the national team. His dedication and commitment helped to lay the groundwork for the future successes of German goalkeepers. Sadly, Ludwig Wenz passed away on April 18, 1968. Despite his death, his legacy continues to serve as an inspiration to aspiring goalkeepers and football enthusiasts in Germany and around the world. His time with the national team may have been brief, but it serves as an essential chapter in the biography of this remarkable goalkeeper, whose name will be remembered in the annals of German football history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Interested in Police Shootings? Add Police Shootings as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Police Shootings news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Eight guns were stolen from Cash America Pawn Saturday before 2 a.m., police said. Of the four suspects who were involved in the burglary, three have been taken into custody. One suspect told police he was looking for bullets to harm police officers in the Baton Rouge Area, said Baton Rouge Police Chief Dabadie, Jr. Police said they consider the threats credible. Six of the firearms, which were all handguns, have been recovered. A BB gun was also stolen from the store. One of the suspects was apprehended while fleeing on foot. A 17-year-old was apprehended on the scene in possession of one handgun and one airsoft BB gun. During questioning, he informed police that he and the three other suspects stole the firearms and were going to get bullets to shoot police. He was booked into parish prison for simple burglary and theft of a firearm, police said. One of the suspects involved in the burglary was a 13-year-old, who was charged with simple burglary and theft of a firearm, police said. Another suspect, 20-year-old Malik Bridgewater, was arrested Sunday at his home and charged with burglary and theft of a firearm. Police recovered three of the stolen handguns from him. Police are asking that the fourth suspect, who is still at large, turn himself in. His identity is unknown. Surveillance video shows the suspects using a ladder to climb to the roof of the building, where they made entry into the store, police said. Investigators recovered two of the stolen handguns from 23-year-old Trashone Coats, who allegedly purchased them illegally on the street, police said. He was charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm. The owner of the pawn shop told police it doesn't appear that any ammunition was taken from the pawn shop. Several law enforcement agencies are investigating the threat, including Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the ATF. Police said they increased their presence in the city following the shooting death of Alton Sterling last week due to the \\"very real and viable threats to law enforcement\\" in the area. The aggressive police response, which showed police in riot gear clearing crowds, was also due in part to the information obtained after the burglary, said East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gatreaux. The investigation is ongoing. ||||| Law enforcement officials in Baton Rouge say four suspects broke into a local pawn shop and stole guns with the intent to attack police officers, just days after the officer-involved shooting of Alton Sterling. Police said the burglary occurred Saturday (July 9) at the Cash America Pawn Store on 3347 Government St. One of the suspects was arrested on or near the scene of the burglary with a handgun, a second suspect was arrested after the burglary on Saturday, and a third, a 13-year-old boy, was arrested Monday. In a statement, police said surveillance video showed the suspects using a ladder to climb the roof of the building to get in early Saturday. Police recovered six handguns from the three suspects, as well as a BB gun pistol. Another two handguns are still on the street, and police are concerned that they remain with the fourth person, who remains at large. Police said they still have not identified the fourth person. Two of the people arrested were identified as Antonio Thomas, 17 and Malik Bridgewater, 20. The 13-year-old was not identified. Thomas was arrested on the scene of the burglary; Bridgewater was arrested Sunday at his home at 2050 Hemlock St. Bridgewater and Thomas were held on charges of simple burglary and theft of a firearm. The plot was uncovered four days after Sterling was shot July 5 as two police officers pinned him to the ground. Sterling's death ignited protests in cities across the nation, leading to dozens of arrests in Baton Rouge. At a July 7 protest in Dallas, a man who told police he was targeting white people shot and killed five officers. State Police Superintendent Mike Edmonson said the information developed since the burglary in Baton Rouge on Saturday revealed \\"an actual, credible threat\\" against police. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said police responding to the protests were dressed in riot gear and armed with automatic weapons because they were concerned some people in the crowd might be armed with the intent to harm police officers. \\"The statement was to get bullets to harm police officers in the Baton Rouge area,\\" Dabadie said in reference to what he said were assertions from the person captured after the pawn shop burglary. \\"We have been questioned repeatedly over the last several days about our show of force and why we have the tactics we have. Well, this is the reason. We had credible threats to the lives of law enforcement in this city.\\" Officials said police were able to get information about the plot from the first person arrested. That person said three other people were involved and that they were looking for guns and ammunition to target police officers, authorities said. Officials said they consider the threat still active, noting one of the suspects remained at large and two of the stolen weapons have not been recovered. Dabadie pleaded with the fourth person to come forward. \\"We ask that suspect, you know who you are, please turn yourself in,\\" Dabadie said. \\"Please come on in, You won't be harmed. ... that way we can recover the rest of the firearms that were taken in this case.\\" East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux said police decided not to disclose the information about the threats against law enforcement when concerns were raised about whether police tactics were heavy-handed. Gautreaux said police did not want to disrupt the investigation, and the arrests were only disclosed after information began to leak in local news reports. \\"What you saw in the response is because of the very real, viable threats against law enforcement,\\" Gautreaux said. \\"Look what happened in Dallas. A very peaceful protest. And then some crazy madman did what he did. We can't take anything for granted anymore.\\" Edmonson said one other credible threat against police has been identified outside of the pawn shop burglary. He said police were investigating whether a police officer was being followed by a suspicious person. Police said there was no indication of when or where an attack against police might take place. A fourth person was also in police custody but was not involved in the plot against police. Police said Trashone Coats, 23, was found in possession of two of the eight handguns and had purchased them illegally on the street. He was charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm. CORRECTION: Authorities initially provided an incorrect photo of Antonio Thomas. The photo has been updated. . . . . . .

While taking a sight-seeing tour on a small boat, he gazes into the ocean and sees something below the surface that fascinates him, while his older brother Freddie Bauer is walking around the boat fascinated by the women. Allen jumps into the water, even though he cannot swim. He grasps the hands of a girl who is inexplicably under the water with him and an instant connection forms between the two. Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy). After Allen is left alone when his motorboat conks out, he again falls into the sea, and is knocked out when the boat hits his head. He wakes up with a headache on a beach, where he encounters a beautiful naked woman with long blonde hair, a necklace with a lion medal, and the inability to talk (Daryl Hannah) who, unknown to him, is the mermaid he met as a boy (her tail transforms into legs when it becomes dry). After kissing him, she dives into the sea and leaves Allen to return home. Kornbluth, while diving in order to seek proof of strange sea creatures, also encounters the mermaid in her sea form, causing him to become obsessed with finding her again.

Kayla didn't get a scholarship. 2). Rebecca didn't get a scholarship.","completion":"2) Rebecca didn't get a scholarship. The dichotomy between Kayla and Rebecca's attitudes toward school was as stark as night and day. Kayla, the more academically inclined of the two, consistently brought home top marks. She diligently studied and submitted assignments on time, always giving her best in each test and project. Her love for learning encompassed a gamut of subjects. Whether it was the complex equations in calculus, the intricate workings of cellular structures in biochemistry, or the fascinating mysteries of the universe in physics, she approached each subject with a zeal that was infectious to others. She had emerged as one of the highest achievers in her batch, a feat she accomplished through sheer hard work, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to her studies. Despite faced with grueling hours of studying and numerous assignment deadlines, Kayla persisted. She was determined to get into a well-reputed university, her dream not merely a college degree, but also a scholarship that tested her merit and recognized her efforts. She yearned ardently for an acknowledgement that symbolized her relentless endeavors, and a scholarship was everything she dreamt of. On the other hand, Rebecca had quite contrasting views on her education. She didn't really care for school. Not that she lacked intellect or capacity; it was more about differing priorities and a different view of her life path. Rebecca had a level of creativity that often conflicted with the linear thinking that was fostered in a traditional academic setting. She had a knack for arts and music, and found joy in writing and exploring the outdoors. To her, school was a chore, something that bridged her world from childhood to adulthood and nothing more. The standard school curriculum often stymied her innovative mindset, and as a result, she didn't perform as well academically. When it came down to scholarships, the final results didn't surprise anyone. Rebecca didn't get a scholarship. Although she was talented in her unique way, her non-academic inclinations and lack of interest in traditional scholastic pursuits reflected in her grades and school activities. Consequently, she didn't meet the standard academic criteria required for scholarship eligibility. As for Kayla, her high-flying grades combined with her impressive list of extracurricular accomplishments made her a perfect candidate, and she was duly rewarded with the precious scholarship she had been striving for. These divergent paths of Kayla and Rebecca only emphasized that while good grades and academic achievements were important for certain ambitions, they shouldn't be the absolute measures of success. Everyone, like Rebecca, should be allowed to follow their own passion and talent, and be appreciated for their unique abilities. It didn't mean that Rebecca was a failure, or that Kayla's achievements were superior – it simply underlined the idea that success can look different for everyone."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

How do I cite a primary historical source when taken from a website? How far down do pile drivers go for very tall buildings? OPT: + no; + yes; The answer is:","completion":"no. The two questions you asked are entirely different and pertain to distinct subjects. The first question, \\"How do I cite a primary historical source when taken from a website?\\" pertains to properly citing an online primary historical source in academic writing or research. Primary historical sources are documents, artifacts, or other materials that were created at the time being studied or by someone who was present during that time. When citing these sources, you must follow guidelines set forth by citation formats such as APA, MLA, or Chicago, which typically include the author's name, the title of the document, the website's name, the publication date, and the URL. The second question, \\"How far down do pile drivers go for very tall buildings?\\" deals with the construction and foundation work of tall buildings. Pile drivers are machines used to drive piles, usually made of steel or concrete, into the ground to create deep foundations for structures. The depth that pile drivers go depends on various factors such as the building's height, weight, and the ground's soil and geological characteristics. In the case of very tall buildings, piles usually need to be driven down tens or even hundreds of feet to provide adequate support and stability. The specific depth would be determined by the building's engineering team after conducting thorough geotechnical studies and analysis. In conclusion, the two questions address completely different topics and are not the same. The first question focuses on proper citation for online primary historical sources, while the second question is related to the depth of pile drivers in the construction of tall buildings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, the","completion":"owner was not interested in her watch and instead offered her a significantly lower price than expected. Sally had inherited the antique watch from her grandmother, who had received it as a gift during her travels across Europe in the early 1900s. The watch featured intricate gold engravings and delicate hand-painted dials, making it a unique and aesthetically striking timepiece. Disappointed but undeterred, Sally had carried out extensive research and consulted various experts, appraising the watch at a much higher value than what the owner of the pawn shop was willing to offer. The tapestry she had set her eyes on was a beautiful piece from the 18th century, depicting lush landscapes and finely woven narrative details that Sally had hoped to hang in her study as a focal point for conversation and wonder. Unfortunately, the owner of the pawn shop, Mr. Thompson, had a penchant for underestimating the value of valuable antiques and overpricing some of their less desirable items. He believed that the watch was not as rare or valuable as Sally claimed, and he proceeded to point out the level of damage incurred by the watch due to its age, such as the scratches on the glass and the slight fading of the numerals. Mr. Thompson also claimed that there was an overabundance of similar watches within the antiques market, making Sally's watch less appealing to potential collectors and, therefore, less valuable than she had previously believed. Sally didn't back down from her stance, as she was aware of the antique watch's true value, and she knew that Mr. Thompson was trying to take advantage of her desperation to acquire the tapestry. She emphasized that she had received professional appraisals and that the watch had historical and sentimental significance, making it a worthwhile exchange for the tapestry she desired. Regrettably, Mr. Thompson remained resolute in his decision not to offer a fair trade or accept the watch for its actual value. He insisted that if Sally wanted the tapestry, she would have to settle for the offer he provided, which was well below what she believed to be a fair exchange. Frustrated and disheartened by Mr. Thompson's refusal to negotiate, Sally left the pawn shop with a greater determination to find a location where her antique watch would be properly valued and appreciated. She also realized that it was essential to explore different options, such as online marketplaces and specialty antique shops, in order to find the tapestry she desired at a more reasonable price. In the end, Sally's experience at the pawn shop taught her that not all venues offer fair evaluations or deals for precious antiques. She also discovered that it is essential to trust her instincts and not be swayed by unscrupulous individuals who may seek to take advantage of those who are passionate about their collections. Despite the setback, Sally remained hopeful that she would soon find a way to trade her antique watch for a marvelous tapestry that would be admired and cherished for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Title: Disappointing Experience with AcDisplay App Review: I am extremely disappointed with the AcDisplay app (com.achep.acdisplay). I had high hopes, expecting this application to simplify my phone's lock screen and notification handling. However, after using it for a week, I can no longer tolerate its various shortcomings and have decided to give it a 1-star review. First and foremost, the app suffers from a plethora of stability and performance issues. It frequently crashes, causing me to waste valuable time trying to restart it, only for the app to inevitably crash again. The few times it manages to stay open, the interface is unresponsive and sluggish, often taking multiple taps to execute a single action. The customization options were insufficient and frequently glitchy. The app claims to offer a wide variety of themes and configurations, but the selection is underwhelming, and the customization options are poorly implemented. Several times I attempted to adjust the settings to enhance my experience, only to encounter errors and find my preferences reset to default upon rebooting the app. I was particularly frustrated with the notification handling feature of AcDisplay. Despite the app's apparent focus on streamlining notifications, it actually complicated the process for me. Notifications either didn't display at all or would appear and then suddenly disappear before I could view them. This eventually led me to miss some crucial messages and calls, resulting in negative repercussions in both my work and personal life. Moreover, battery drainage was a significant issue I encountered while using AcDisplay. The app consumed an unusually large amount of power, even when not in active use. I noticed a drastic decrease in my phone's battery life since installing this app, often requiring me to recharge multiple times a day. This is certainly not an efficient or practical long-term solution, especially for people who rely on their devices heavily throughout the day. Lastly, the lack of customer support was the final straw. When I encountered multiple issues with the app, I searched for ways to resolve them and reached out to the developer's support team, only to receive no response at all. With a seemingly non-existent customer service system in place, this app fell short in addressing users' concerns and issues. In summary, the AcDisplay app has been a severely negative experience for me, marred by performance issues, lackluster customization options, failed notification handling, excessive battery drainage, and all but absent customer support. I strongly discourage other potential users from downloading this app and advise that they seek out alternative solutions for a more satisfactory and beneficial experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Boali, Central African Republic -Â Robert KolofioÂ was finally able to bury his younger brother Konoumon MauriceÂ in February, more than a year after he disappeared. His family says Maurice, along with 11 others, was executed by soldiers from Congo Brazzaville who were part ofÂ an African Union peacekeeping force.

People in Boali, the western town where MauriceÂ was from, say he had kept the peace but an altercation with a Congolese AU commander could have led to his death. Most of the graves alongside MauriceÂ are marked unknown because identifying the highly decomposed bodies was difficult. Among the bodies was a pregnant women. \\"What I saw was just skull and bones.

Write a title for this article: There’s a big difference between annoying calls and outright scams. Telemarketing rules limit the kind of phone calls consumers can receive, but scam calls ignore those restrictions. Calls with prerecorded messages made by computerized dialing devices, commonly known as robocalls, are forbidden with just a few exceptions. (Unfortunately, calls from politicians are one of those exceptions.) So when you get a robocall, often from a generic-sounding company such as “Cardholder Services,” it’s probably a scam. Typically, the recording tries to convince you that you can lower the interest rate on your credit card or extend your auto warranty, enticing you to get on the line with a real person. Ultimately, they want you to pay them money for a worthless offer. Lately, though, more people are complaining about an increase of these calls, which pretend to be from government agencies and utilities. A reader recently wrote in about calls from the Internal Revenue Service threatening arrest if he didn’t pay money he supposedly owed. The IRS might not be a beloved agency, but that sort of call is not part of its repertoire. The scam tries to coax a frightened recipient of the call to send money to avoid arrest. Similarly, National Grid and other utilities are warning about calls instructing consumers to provide bank account information over the phone immediately or have their electricity or gas shut off. While utilities make reminder calls (sometimes using prerecorded messages) noting that failure to pay a bill could result in utilities getting turned off, the legitimate calls won’t demand financial information. The easiest way to verify the legitimacy of such a call is to contact the utility directly at the phone number on the bill, not the one the caller gives. The Do Not Call list can help with legitimate telemarketers, but it doesn’t help with scams. Consumers can report the calls to the Federal Trade Commission using the agency’s online form, but that doesn’t mean the calls will stop. So be on guard for this latest round of scam calls, and do not give out personal or financial information on any call you don’t initiate.","completion":"Unmasking Robocalls: Deciphering Annoying Telemarketing from Dangerous Scams"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.

While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Verkehrsbetrieb der Landschaft Davos Gemeinde is a bus operating company in the municipality of Davos , Switzerland . The company is wholly owned by the municipal authorities , and operates 13 buses on 13 lines serving the various communities in Davos and the surrounding areas . - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons. - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - The Rhaetian Alps are a mountain range of the Eastern Alps. The SOIUSA classification system divides them into the Western and Eastern Rhaetian Alps, while the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps places most of the Rhaetion subranges within the Western Limestone Alps. They are located along the ItalianSwiss and AustrianSwiss borders, in the canton of Graubünden in eastern Switzerland; in the state of Tyrol in Austria; and in the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige and Lombardy. - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Landwasser (German, lit.: \\"water of/for the land\\") is a river in Switzerland, canton of Graubünden. Its origin was Lake Davos before this was turned into a reservoir for a power station. Nowadays it is prolonged by the creek Flüelabach at its source and changes its name near Davos Dorf. Davos is the largest town and except for the last bit the only larger settlement on the river. Landwasser empties into the Albula below Filisur. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.

HEAVE HALF A BRICK AT HIM \\"For strangers then did so increase, By reason of King Henry's queen, And privileged in many a place To dwell, as was in London seen. Poor tradesmen had small dealing then And who but strangers bore the bell, Which was a grief to Englishmen To see them here in London dwell.\\" Ill May Day, by CHURCHILL, a Contemporary Poet. Time passed on, and Edmund Burgess, who had been sent from York to learn the perfection of his craft, completed his term and returned to his home, much regretted in the Dragon court, where his good humour and good sense had generally kept the peace, both within and without. Giles Headley was now the eldest prentice. He was in every way greatly improved, thoroughly accepting his position, and showing himself quite ready both to learn and to work; but he had not the will or the power of avoiding disputes with outsiders, or turning them aside with a merry jest; and rivalries and quarrels with the armoury at the Eagle began to increase. The Dragon, no doubt, turned out finer workmanship, and this the Eagle alleged was wholly owing to nefarious traffic with the old Spanish or Moorish sorcerer in Warwick Inner Yard, a thing unworthy of honest Englishmen. This made Giles furious, and the cry never failed to end in a fight, in which Stephen supported the cause of the one house, and George Bates and his comrades of the other. It was the same with even the archery at Mile End, where the butts were erected, and the youth contended with the long bow, which was still considered as the safeguard of England. King Henry often looked in on these matches, and did honour to the winners. One match there was in especial, on Mothering Sunday, when the champions of each guild shot against one another at such a range that it needed a keen eye to see the popinjay--a stuffed bird at which they shot.

Plot title: Jurassic Park Movie plot: The story begins on Isla Nublar, a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica. A large group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal attempts to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic, and the death of one of the workers.The story jumps forward to an Amber mine in the Dominican Republic, where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a genetic-engineering company called InGen. We also learn that the death of the worker seen earlier has raised serious concerns about the safety of the island, according to Donald Gennaro, an InGen representative, and that the owner of the island is now seeking top scientific experts in the field to help endorse the park.At a paleontological excavation in Montana we are introduced to Dr. Alan Grant, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a Velociraptor, perhaps nature's most lethal and cunning predator to date, a beautiful specimen evolved to kill. Part of Grant's research experiments with a new radiological device that shoots a probe into the dirt which bounces an image of an uncovered raptor skeleton back to a computer screen.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I can use this background: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] Now, I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Answer this question please: Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi. The reason for this is the higher level of water saturation in Peak Forest compared to Valley Forest. Wood-decay fungi require excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood to colonize and proliferate. Even though both forests receive a similar amount of rainfall, the presence of a drainage system in Valley Forest, consisting of ditches dug by the locals, reduces the water saturation, which in turn reduces the rate of wood decay and the growth of wood-decay fungi. In contrast, the higher rate of wood decay in Peak Forest indicates more favorable conditions for wood-decay fungi, which leads to a higher presence of these fungi in that area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's... Guess a valid title for it!

He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Wang Mang (c. 45 6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos. - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator ( ) of Changsha ( ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders . - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved. - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han. - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty. - Cao Cao (155 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals. - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history. - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang. - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han founded by Liu Bei in 221 in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. - Liu Bei (161 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu. - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class. - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.

Solve this instance: Analyzing the roll of the foot remains standard practice among fitness and medical professionals in the belief it will lead to a better shoe fit and fewer injuries. “When it comes to shoe choice, the amount of pronation control is extremely important,” said Dr. Jane Andersen, a podiatrist in private practice in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “Some people need more than others. It can cause a lot of problems if you have the wrong one.” Anderson, a runner herself and past president of the American Association for Women Podiatrists, said the No. 1 cause of the overuse injuries she sees, from stress fractures to tendonitis to Plantar fasciitis (heel pain), is shoes that are worn out or the wrong fit. There are three basic levels of control for standard running shoes: neutral, stability and motion control. “Neutral is generally good for a high-arch foot; it doesn’t provide extra control for pronation,” she said. “The stability shoe works for people who need more support; motion control is for the super flat-footed.” At Jack Rabbit Sports store in New York City, clients’ arches are observed before they hit the treadmill for runs that are videotaped for slow-motion analysis. “The basic premise is that most people land on their heel (and) overpronate or underpronate,” said Johanna Bjorken, the store’s merchandise director. “This causes running injuries and shoes can address this. This has been the model.” Bjorken said neutral shoes account for 60 to 63 percent of the running shoes sold in her store; 30 to 35 percent are stability shoes. The mobility category is very small and usually follows on doctor’s advice. “Some rolling in is natural, normal and beneficial,” she explained. “Compared to 20 years ago, running shoes are really much more flexible, lightweight and well designed to work with movements of running.” American Council on Exercise spokesperson, Dr. Mark Kelly, a runner for 35 years, is a self-described underpronator who believes in heeding an individual’s “biomechanical tendencies.” “Get a certified trainer to look at the biomechanics of how you’re running,” Kelly said. “How are you turning your foot? Are you a forefoot striker, midfoot striker, heel striker, or extreme heel striker?” Connecticut-based exercise physiologist Tom Holland, author of “The Marathon Method,” thinks many of the common running-related injuries, such as runner’s knee, shin splints and hip issues are related to and exacerbated by improper footwear. “Once you find a shoe that works for you, stick with it,” he said. Nevertheless, a recent Danish study cast doubt on whether shoes that control pronation do actually cut down on injury. But the scientists said more work is needed to determine if highly pronated feet face a higher risk of injury than neutral feet.

He was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. The interior is contemporary Japanese and beautiful. And the food was fantastic. We had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish. Tuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing. Blue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong. And the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Cleisthenes (\\"Kleisthéns\\"; also Clisthenes or Kleisthenes) was a noble Athenian of the Alcmaeonid family. He is credited with reforming the constitution of ancient Athens and setting it on a democratic footing in 508/7 BC. For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as \\"the father of Athenian democracy.\\" He was the maternal grandson of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon, as the younger son of the latter's daughter Agariste and her husband Megacles. Also, he was credited with increasing the power of the Athenian citizens assembly and for reducing the power of the nobility over Athenian politics. - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - The Peloponnesian League was an alliance in the Peloponnesus from the 6th to the 4th centuries BC. It is known mainly for being one of the two rivals in the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) - The Clouds ( Ancient Greek : Nephelai ) is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes . A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens , it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423 BC and was not as well - received as the author had hoped , coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year . It was revised between 420 - 417 BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form . No copy of the original production survives , and scholarly analysis indicates that the revised version is an incomplete form of Old Comedy . This incompleteness , however , is not obvious in translations and modern performances . Retrospectively , The Clouds can be considered the world 's first extant ' comedy of ideas ' , and is considered by literary critics to be among the finest example of the genre . The play also , however , remains notorious for its caricature of Socrates , and is mentioned in Plato 's Apology as a contributor to the philosopher 's trial and execution . - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - The Delian League, founded in 478 BC, was an association of Greek city-states, members numbering between 150 173, to 330 under the leadership of Athens, whose purpose was to continue fighting the Persian Empire after the Greek victory in the Battle of Plataea at the end of the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The League's modern name derives from its official meeting place, the island of Delos, where congresses were held in the temple and where the treasury stood until, in a symbolic gesture, Pericles moved it to Athens in 454 BC. - Aristophanes (or ; c. 446 c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it. - The Lamian War, or the Hellenic War (323322 BC) was fought by a coalition of Greek cities including Athens and the Aetolian League against Macedon and its ally Boeotia. The war ended in a Macedonian victory. - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - Pericles (\\"Perikls\\", in Classical Attic; c. 495 429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during the Golden Agespecifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Hegemony (or , or \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE 6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\". - Democracy (\\"\\" literally \\"rule of the commoners\\"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament. Democracy is sometimes referred to as \\"rule of the majority\\". Democracy was originally conceived in Classical Greece, where political representatives were chosen by a jury from amongst the male citizens: rich and poor. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - Polis, plural poleis literally means city in Greek. It can also mean citizenship and body of citizens. In modern historiography, \\"polis\\" is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as \\"city-state\\". - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.

Next question: who wrote the song he's so fine?","completion":"\\"He's So Fine\\" is a song written by Ronald Mack, whose full name is Ronald Wilbur Mashburn. He was an American songwriter who is best known for composing this song. \\"He's So Fine\\" is a classic example of 1960s doo-wop and pop music, characterized by its distinctive melody, catchy rhythm, and memorable lyrics. The song became widely popular and achieved commercial success after it was recorded and released by The Chiffons, an all-female vocal group from the United States. In 1963, The Chiffons recorded \\"He's So Fine\\" under the supervision of producer and composer Phil Spector. The song features three singers from The Chiffons – Judy Craig (lead vocalist), Patricia Bennett, and Barbara Lee, with Sylvia Peterson joining the group later. \\"He's So Fine\\" became the Chiffons' biggest and most enduring hit, soaring to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and remaining there for four weeks. The song's success catapulted The Chiffons to new heights of fame and secured their place in music history. The distinct sound and style of \\"He's So Fine\\" has had a lasting influence on popular music, inspiring numerous covers, adaptations, and even legal disputes. Perhaps the most notable instance is George Harrison's 1970 song \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" which was the subject of a high-profile copyright infringement lawsuit due to its similarities with \\"He's So Fine.\\" In 1976, a court ruled that Harrison had 'subconsciously copied' parts of \\"He's So Fine\\" while writing \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" highlighting the song's enduring impact on the music world. Ronald Mack's contribution to pop music history, \\"He's So Fine,\\" remains a beloved and recognizable song to this day, making him a noteworthy figure in the annals of music composition.

News article: The Next Nightmare May Lurk in the Medicine Cabinet A long list of popular medications, from antihistamines to antidepressants to beta-blockers, are known to cause nightmares, largely because they interrupt natural REM and nonREM sleep cycles. Melinda Beck on Lunch Break looks at why this happens. The next time you're outrunning a pack of hungry wolves, naked, and then wake up in a cold sweat, remind yourself it's only a bad dream—and that it could be a side effect of a prescription medication you're taking. A wide array of drugs can cause nightmares. The list includes certain antidepressants, antibiotics, beta blockers, blood-pressure medications, statins for lowering cholesterol and drugs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Some drugs tend to cause bad dreams when they are first taken; others bring nightmares when they're stopped. Alcohol, over-the-counter antihistamines and some dietary supplements have the same effect. \\"This is a very common complaint,\\" says Andres San Martin, a psychiatrist in New York City. \\"You put a patient on an antidepressant and routinely, they'll say, 'You know I'm feeling better, but I'm having very vivid dreams.' The emotion and passion can be quite overwhelming.\\" Although the mechanisms aren't completely understood, sleep experts think drugs cause nightmares because they interfere with so-called sleep architecture—the stages of light, deep and rapid-eye-movement, or REM, sleep that people typically rotate through three or four times a night. The REM stages, during which the most vivid dreams occur, normally get longer toward morning. But some medications delay or decrease REM, and some create a \\"REM rebound\\" effect when people stop taking them, making the REM stage unusually long or intense. A broad array of prescription medications, including those to treat anxiety, high blood pressure and ADHD can cause disturbing, unusual dreams. \\"Whenever REM sleep is altered, that leads to nightmares,\\" says Naresh Dewan, a professor of sleep medicine at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., and co-author of a review of drug-induced sleep disturbances in June in the journal Consultant Pharmacist. Sleep experts say medications particularly apt to bring troubling dreams are those that affect neurotransmitters, the brain's chemical messengers that influence sleep cycles, among other things. That includes most antidepressants, as well as antihistamines and anticholinergic drugs used to treat a broad range of conditions, from overactive bladder to bronchial spasms. Sleeping pills can also disrupt sleep cycles and cause nightmares. Pinpointing how frequently medications cause nightmares is difficult because bad dreams are so common, and there's no way to prove cause and effect. Nearly 90% of people have nightmares at some point and about 5% of adults have them chronically, according to the American Sleep Association. Bad dreams may also be due to sleep apnea, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder or a carry-over from anxiety during the day. People should suspect a drug connection if weird or disturbing dreams have begun soon after starting a new medication or stopping an old one, sleep specialists say. Sleep experts say drugs may interfere with so-called sleep architecture. Some prescription drug labels have warnings of mention the possibility of nightmares, abnormal dreams or sleep disturbances, but some experts say nightmares they are probably underreported in trials and on labels because patients don't think to mention them, and doctors rarely ask. \\"From a doctor's point of view, it's sometimes a Pandora's box because if you start routinely asking all patients about their dreams, you may be opening something that medicine cannot fix,\\" says P. Murali Doraiswamy a neuroscientist at Duke University Medical School. It isn't clear why disrupted REM sleep tends to bring nightmares rather than more pleasant dreams. \\"The purpose, triggers and biology of dreams, both pleasant and frightening, are still some of the biggest mysteries in all of science,\\" says Dr. Doraiswamy. \\"It could be an evolutionary defense mechanism or could be the brain's way of doing psychotherapy on itself.\\" Modern psychiatrists, led by Allan Hobson of Harvard Medical School, believe dreams are electrical pulses from the brain stem randomly bombarding the center of the brain where visual memories are stored, creating kaleidoscopes of images around which the brain concocts stories. Followers of Sigmund Freud believe dreams are repressed desires or threats. Nightmares aren't necessarily harmful themselves, but if they happen frequently, they can set the stage for chronic sleep deprivation, which can hamper daytime functioning and increase the risk of diabetes and other health problems. Some nightmares are so disturbing that the effects linger for hours or longer. Alesandra Rain still recalls the dreams of suicide she had while taking a variety of sleep and pain medications nine years ago. In one, she went skydiving with a defective parachute; in another, she removed the lug nuts from her tires and gunned her car down a winding mountain road. Ms. Rain, 54, was so disturbed by the dreams and the long list of drugs she was taking that she quit them cold turkey and started a nonprofit organization, Point of Return, in Westlake Village, Calif., to help others wean themselves off of multiple prescription drugs. \\"I haven't had a nightmare in nine years,\\" she says. Some medications that have been reported to cause abnormal dreams and other sleep disturbances. Source: Drug labels; The Consultant Pharmacist, June, 2011 Most physicians tell patients not to stop medications abruptly on their own. Tapering off can help avoid withdrawal nightmares. In some cases, taking a drug at a different time of day can improve sleep. Dr. San Martin tells patients to take some SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the morning, but those that have a sedative effect closer to bedtime. Cutting dosages or switching to another brand in the same class may also be an option. For severe sleep disruption, some doctors give patients yet another prescription to help them sleep. Common choices include Klonopin, an antiseizure medication; Trazodone, often used in sleep clinics for insomnia, or Prazosin, a beta blocker that helps quell anxiety. All three can bring on nightmares themselves, so some doctors see prescribing a new drug as a last resort. Some chronic nightmare sufferers find relief with Image Rehearsal Therapy, a technique pioneered in the 1990s in which patients write out their typical nightmare, then imagine a new, benign ending for it. Shelby Harris, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., says her favorite example was a young patient who kept dreaming he was being chased by a scary man. In the new scenario he concocted, the setting was the theme park in Hershey, Pa. The man was made of chocolate and the boy ate him. Patients practice visualizing the new dream several times a day for several weeks. Even if that particular dream never recurs, the nightmares typically end. \\"Once people believe they have control over their nightmare, that's when they start to get better,\\" says Dr. Harris. Experts say that people who are troubled by nightmares should let their doctors know. Disturbed REM sleep and vivid dreaming can also be an early warning sign of some types of epilepsy, dementia and Parkinson's disease. \\"It's important to address whether [nightmares] are due to a medication or if something else is going on,\\" says Dr. Harris. \\"Don't assume that nothing can be done.\\" Write to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Please write a short summary for the following article: New York’s New High-End Rentals A slew of high-end, high-profile rental buildings are poised to open across Manhattan and Brooklyn this year, adding more than 8,000 units at a pace not seen in years, and in the process, redefining what rental housing in the city can be. Many of these new rental buildings are large, tall and unusually shaped. Some are in untested residential areas, which might explain their devotion to lavishly entertaining their occupants by piling on the amenities both indoors and out. Soon-to-be-completed examples include Via 57West, on an industrial edge of Manhattan’s West Side; 461 Dean Street, by the Barclays Center at the Vanderbilt Yards in Brooklyn; and 365 Bond Street, on the banks of the Gowanus Canal. Prices, too, are lofty, with studios in some of the buildings renting for about 5,000 a month. While any softness in the rental market — new leasing activity has slowed in recent months, and vacancies are up — could spell challenges going forward, most developers say they are undeterred. “New York is safer and cleaner than it’s been in decades, and we fully expect people to keep moving here,” said Adam R. Rose, a president of Rose Associates, which is converting 70 Pine Street, an Art Deco office building in the financial district, into a 776-unit rental. “And the fact is, we need virtually unlimited housing at all levels,” he added. Once, a driveway and porte-cochere might have been enough to provide a building with an air of prestige, but rentals today seem to be springing for brash top-to-bottom designs. Like their condo kin, rentals are increasingly opting for architects with boldface names. Via 57West, a 709-unit rental at 625 West 57th Street, for example, was designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group. Mr. Ingels is the Danish designer whose résumé also includes Two World Trade Center. Those expecting four walls and a roof at Via, which is to open in March, may be disappointed. There is no roof at all, only sloping walls that taper to a point at the 42nd story, recalling a tilting tepee or a wizard’s hat, though the developer, the Durst Organization, prefers “tetrahedron.” Because the metal-paneled rental is near the West Side Highway, a gateway to Manhattan, the city’s Planning Commission didn’t want some humdrum rectangle, according to Durst officials. But Mr. Ingels’ great pyramid also allowed Durst to preserve Hudson River views from the windows of the Helena, a rental that the company owns next door, according to a Durst spokesman. The offbeat style produced unusual layouts. A 685-square-foot one-bedroom with tall windows that was a stop on a recent tour had an angled exterior wall, which might not be ideal for straight-backed furniture. “We have apartments with a lot of character to them,” said Jonathan Drescher, a Durst senior vice president. And those apartments seem tailored to younger, unattached renters, as 85 percent are studios, starting at 2,770 a month, or one-bedrooms, starting at 3,880. In contrast, the median price of a studio in Manhattan in December was 2,562 a month, while that of a one-bedroom was 3,375, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Via and other buildings are adding rental units to the market in a banner development year. About 4,900 apartments in large and mostly market-rate buildings are expected to open their doors in Manhattan in 2016, according to data prepared for The New York Times by Cliff Finn, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, and George Wlodarczyk, a research director there. This is a significant increase, as the number has hovered below 3,000 a year since at least 2010. Eight of the 15 major buildings to open this year, according to Elliman, offer 300 apartments or more. Similarly, Brooklyn will add about 3,300 apartments in major projects in 2016, Elliman said, the most since 2014, when about 3,000 units entered the market. But in previous years, going back to 2007, the number of new apartments that opened in the borough was much lower. This housing surge comes at a time of some weakness in the market. In December, the median rent in the Manhattan luxury market — that is, the top 10 percent of all transactions — nudged down to 8,500 a month from 8,537 a month in November. Similarly, the November median was down from October, when it was 8,750, according to Elliman data prepared by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. In addition, the city has more empty apartments than usual. Traditionally, in New York, the dividing line between a robust and not-so-great market is a 2 percent vacancy rate. Since June of last year, the rate has been higher, with November’s at 2.87 percent, the highest in nine years, Mr. Miller said. In December, the rate was 2.74 percent. With empty apartments and dipping rents, the market is not ideally suited for thousands of new units, which could depress prices further. For renters, that could be a good thing. Mr. Miller said concessions are already part of the picture. Both Via 57West and 70 Pine are offering two free months on a 14-month lease, which is more than the one month traditionally offered under similar conditions, Mr. Miller said. “I think there is great confusion about demand for this product,” Mr. Miller added. “It’s not correct to say that demand is not there for this new product. It is more accurate to say that in many, if not most, cases, demand is not there at prices set a few years ago.” Of course, developers won’t really know where things stand until their rental offices actually open. But so far, many of the rentals scheduled to hit the market in the next few months come with high monthly price tags. The new 11-story, 106-unit rental from the Related Companies at 456 Washington Street in TriBeCa, for instance, will have studios starting at 4,995 a month, while one-bedrooms will start at 5,295, though a Related spokeswoman pointed out that the building, which is to open in May, is in a prime location, and that its apartments are larger than most of the firm’s other properties. Studios are around 600 square feet, she said, while one-bedrooms range from 700 to 750 square feet. Also in May, Related will unveil the Easton, a 230-unit rental on East 92nd Street, where one-bedrooms will start at 4,295 a month. If rents seem steep, they need to be considered along with the costs of building apartment houses, which can be astronomical, according to Jed Walentas, a principal of Two Trees Management Company, which is developing 300 Ashland Place, a 379-unit tower across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, to open at summer’s end. The building, clad in aluminum-composite panels, was designed by TEN Arquitectos, Enrique Norten’s firm. From above, the building resembles a flattened football with its pointed ends trimmed, creating slightly curving walls. It was built under the 421-a program, which gives developers breaks on their property taxes if they construct and maintain affordable housing in a so-called 80-20 building — 80 percent market-rate rents and 20 percent below-market or affordable rents. Developers say that in a city where land is so pricey, it can be almost impossible to build without the program, especially rentals, for which revenue trickles in over time. The controversial benefit, which critics say enriches developers at the expense of the public and has outlived its usefulness, expired in January, and its impending end helped fuel the current rental-building boom, some developers say. Other builders, though, say the rental surge is more the result of the post-recession recovery, and began when these projects were conceived a few years ago. At 300 Ashland Place, 421-a has made a big difference. The 170 million project will realize savings of up to 2 million a year in property taxes for 25 years, or about 50 million, according to Two Trees officials, in exchange for the building’s 76 below-market-rate apartments. As Mr. Walentas scanned the horizon from his rising tower, which provides views of low-slung sections of Brooklyn that were mostly unattainable before the rental boom, he said he wasn’t worried about competition. “The more people build, the better it’s going to be for everybody,” he said, adding that the rising buildings help strengthen neighborhoods. One new rental in the current crop, 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, will be split almost evenly between apartments with below-market rents and market-rate apartments. The 363-unit project from Forest City Ratner Companies, which is made of prefabricated modules, will have 181 apartments with lower rents. About 40 percent of the affordable units, or 72, will be for people making 100 percent to 160 percent of the area’s median income, or up to 138,080 for a family of four. That family could end up paying 2,800 a month for a two-bedroom, said Susi Yu, an executive vice president of Forest City. “This is actually a segment of the market that really has been overlooked,” Ms. Yu said, referring to the income bracket of that same family of four. Forest City has not yet determined what a market-rate two-bedroom would cost in the building. In December, the median price of a two-bedroom in Brooklyn was 3,350 a month, Elliman said. To score one of the coveted reduced-rent units at 461 Dean, renters must enter a lottery, which will be organized by Forest City and the city’s Housing Development Corporation. When the lottery is announced, which is expected “imminently,” according to a project spokeswoman, applicants will have 60 days to register at the New York City Housing Connect web page, or by paper application. To get the word out about the application process, Forest City will contact labor unions, community boards and churches. Each applicant will receive a number. If that number is drawn, he or she must submit tax returns, landlord references and bank statements to verify eligibility. Priority will be given to people with visual impairments and other disabilities, and secondarily, to those who live within the boundaries of Brooklyn Community Boards 2, 3, 6 and 8. Municipal workers also will have an advantage. As has been the case for several years, buildings in less-residential neighborhoods are packed with extras designed to give their occupants something to do in otherwise quiet areas. But the amount of space dedicated to these amenities has mushroomed. At Via by the West Side Highway, for instance, the 30,000 square feet of indoor amenity space will include a 75-foot swimming pool, a half basketball court and a leather-walled room designated for poker. A terraced courtyard planted with pitch pines, river birches and honey locusts will offer another 22,000 square feet of communal space. Four retail spaces will line the building’s base. Another 75-foot swimming pool will turn up at Eos, a glassy 375-unit Durst project at 100 West 31st Street in NoMad to open this year. Sidewalk windows peer down at the pool, so passers-by can admire people doing the backstroke below. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, at 365 Bond Street, a 430-unit, 80-20 building from the Lightstone Group next to the Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site, residents will avail themselves of 40,000 square feet of amenity space. Among the offerings are a yoga room, a children’s playroom and a rooftop lounge with barbecue grills. The building, which broke ground in 2014, opens in March. Interest in the affordable component has been intense, with more than 56,000 applications received for the 86 below-market units. Applications closed last month. Market-rate studios there will start in the “low 2,000s,” a spokesman said, adding that “we don’t have concessions finalized yet.” The building will be by a dock from which kayaks can be launched for paddling the Gowanus, which is scheduled to be cleaned starting this year, said Mitchell C. Hochberg, Lightstone’s president. “I think Gowanus is one of the most exciting places in the city, like Williamsburg 10 years ago,” Mr. Hochberg said. But in a shift, even developers in more central areas are acknowledging a new cultural reality: that young renters, who may work and live under the same roof, and have all their groceries delivered, might not set foot outside that much. At amenity-loaded 70 Pine, “the whole idea is that you don’t ever have to leave the building,” Mr. Rose said. Rents for studios on the lower floors of the 1932 building, which are now being marketed, start at 3,100 a month, and 21 leases were signed between December and the end of January. The next batch of studios, on higher floors, will inch up to 3,200 a month, Mr. Rose said. The building has about 19,000 square feet of amenities, spread across two below-grade levels, including a two-lane bowling alley and a 20-seat screening room in an old bank vault, whose door will be welded into the open position. Seventy Pine’s fitness center will be run by La Palestra, a company whose services extend to arranging out-of-building exercise at places like Mount Kilimanjaro. There will be about 31,500 square feet of retail space, including a branch of the upscale grocer Urban Market. And the top four levels of the building, which has a window-lined observation deck, will house a yet-to-be named restaurant from the team behind the Spotted Pig in the West Village. The list of amenities dazzles even Mr. Rose. “I’ve been in this business for 30 years, and we’ve never done this much in one place before,” he said. Correction: February 9, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the maximum income for a family of four to be eligible for an affordable two-bedroom apartment at 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, based on information supplied by the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies. It is 138,080, not 124,000. Summary:","completion":"New York is seeing an influx of luxury apartment buildings opening across Manhattan and Brooklyn, redefining rental property expectations within the city. Over 8,000 new rental units are set to open this year alone, boasting a variety of high-end features and amenities, as bold face-name architects now also design rental properties, in addition to condos. The prices are increasing just as quickly as the buildings themselves, with the median price of a studio apartment in Manhattan now at 2,562 a month, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. A significant increase in new apartment buildings is expected in Manhattan this year, with around 4,900 large rental units coming to the market, up from below 3,000 a year since at least 2010.

The organizers of New York City's annual march down Fifth Avenue are about to find out. The makers of the popular Irish beer announced over the weekend that they pulled their sponsorship of the parade due to organizers' longstanding rule against gay and lesbian groups marching openly. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT \\"Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all,” the company said in a statement posted on the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation website Sunday. \\"We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year’s parade. As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy.\\" The move by Guinness follows similar moves by fellow beer companies Heineken and Sam Adams, the latter of which pulled its sponsorship from Sunday's parade in the traditional Irish stronghold of South Boston. The decision also left Ford Motor Company as the only major U.S. company sponsoring the New York City parade, which dates back to 1762. Companies aren't the only ones conspicuous by their absence from city parades. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio will become the first mayor in decades to sit out the march due to the dispute. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh didn't take part in his city's parade, either, after talks broke down that would have allowed a gay group to march. One leader who does plan to march in New York Monday is Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who defended himself against criticism over his decision earlier this week, saying \\"The St. Patrick's Day parade (in New York) is a parade about our Irishness and not about sexuality, and I would be happy to participate in it.\\" Parade organizers have said gay groups are not prohibited from marching, but are not allowed to carry gay-friendly signs or identify themselves as LGBT. In Michigan, parades were Sunday held in Bay City and Detroit, and on Monday a St. Patrick's Day Parade was scheduled in Cleveland. Cities from Savannah, Ga., to Montreal also hosted festivities over the weekend, and throughout the world landmarks were bathed in green floodlights. Some LGBT groups were to protest the parade, while others had planned to dump Guinness from the shelves of the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the gay rights movement. That demonstration was canceled late Sunday after Guinness put out its statement yanking its sponsorship. Despite the controversy, New York's parade, a tradition that predates the city itself, is expected to draw more than 1 million spectators and about 200,000 participants Monday. It has long been a mandatory stop on the city's political trail, and will include marching bands, traditional Irish dancers and thousands of uniformed city workers. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Bill de Blasio and Martin Walsh (L) speak to the press outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, December 13, 2013, following their meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama and other newly-elected mayors about job creation. BOSTON Irish brewer Guinness said on Sunday that it would not participate in New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade this year because gay and lesbian groups had been excluded, costing organizers a key sponsor of the annual event. The move came on the same day that Boston's Irish-American mayor skipped that city's St. Patrick's Day parade after failing to hammer out a deal with organizers to allow a group of gay and lesbian activists to march openly. \\"Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all. We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year's parade,\\" the brewer said in a written statement issued by a spokesman for its parent company, Diageo. \\"As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy,\\" Guinness said. Last week New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would not march in the parade because gay and lesbian activists had been again precluded from taking part. The loss of Guinness, one of the world's top beer brands originating in Dublin, Ireland, appeared to ratchet up the pressure on organizers even further. On Friday, two other major beer companies, Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer Co and Heineken dropped their sponsorship of parades in Boston and New York, respectively, over the issue. Representatives for the New York board of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, which has run the parade for more than 150 years, could not be reached for comment on Sunday afternoon. Earlier in the day Boston Mayor Marty Walsh skipped his city's parade when he couldn't negotiate a deal with organizers, the conservative Allied War Veteran's Council, to allow members of MassEquality, one of Massachusetts' largest gay activist groups, to join. INCREASING CRITICISM \\"So much of our Irish history has been shaped by the fight against oppression,\\" Walsh, the city's first Irish-American mayor in 20 years, said in a statement. \\"As mayor of the city of Boston, I have to do my best to ensure that all Bostonians are free to participate fully in the civic life of our city. Unfortunately, this year, the parties were not able to come to an understanding that would have made that possible.\\" Despite Walsh's boycott, other prominent Democratic Boston politicians, including Representative Stephen Lynch, marched in the parade, which drew tens of thousands of spectators, some of whom expressed disappointment at MassEquality's exclusion. \\"It's supposed to be a time when everyone can come together,\\" said university student Jeyashri Sridhar, 18. \\"It's sad that people can't participate because of who they are.\\" Organizers of St. Patrick's Day parades in New York and Boston, among the most liberal-leaning cities in the United States, have come under increasing criticism in recent years for banning openly gay marchers. Parade organizers argue that to do so would conflict with their Roman Catholic heritage. The Catholic church contends that homosexual activity is immoral. While MassEquality did not participate, the parade was not without gay marchers. South Boston resident Randy Foster, along with his husband Steve Martin, organized a diversity-themed float that sported rainbow flags but no direct gay rights messages. Foster said the flags represented the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in Irish lore, though he acknowledged the gay-rights movement uses a rainbow flag. \\"If there's a dual message to it, we're OK with it and so are the parade organizers,\\" said Foster, 48. \\"We made the point of not making it a gay float. If we're going to have a message of inclusion, it shouldn't be for one group.\\" Massachusetts in 2003 became the first U.S. state to legalize gay marriage. Attitudes on gay marriage have changed markedly across the nation since then, with 17 states and the District of Columbia now allowing same-sex couples to wed.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) (Associated Press) New York's Irish, their descendants and the Irish for a day planned to revel in the celebration of culture on Monday, but de Blasio's decision to skip the parade underscores lingering political tensions over gay rights issues in the Northeast. Boston's Mayor Martin Walsh opted out of his city's parade on Sunday after talks broke down that would have allowed a gay veterans group to march. Parade organizers said they did not want the event to turn into a demonstration for a particular group, but Walsh said their plans prevented all Boston residents from participating fully. Still, thousands of green-clad spectators came out to watch bagpipers and marchers in Boston, and organizers of a float intended to promote diversity threw Mardi Gras-type beads to onlookers. A similar scene played out in downtown Philadelphia. In Michigan, parades were Sunday held in Bay City and Detroit, and on Monday, a St. Patrick's Day Parade was scheduled in Cleveland. Cities from Savannah, Ga., to Montreal also hosted festivities over the weekend, and throughout the world, landmarks were bathed in green floodlights. Ireland's head of government, Enda Kenny, on Sunday became the first Irish prime minister to attend Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast. Kenny has resisted pressure, in both Ireland and America, to support the gay rights lobby's demand to have equal rights to participate in parades on St. Patrick's Day. \\"The St. Patrick's Day parade (in New York) is a parade about our Irishness and not about sexuality, and I would be happy to participate in it,\\" he said in Dublin before leaving for a six-day trip to the U.S. In Ireland, St. Patrick's Day provides the launch of the country's annual push for tourism, a big part of the rural economy. \\"To Irish people by birth or descent, wherever they may be in the world, and to those who simply consider themselves to be friends of Ireland, I wish each and every one of you a happy, peaceful and authentically Irish St. Patrick's Day,\\" Irish President Michael D. Higgins, the ceremonial head of state and guest of honor at Monday's parade in Dublin, said in a statement. Parade organizers in New York have said gay groups are not prohibited from marching, but are not allowed to carry gay-friendly signs or identify themselves as LGBT. Some LGBT groups were to protest the parade along the parade route on Fifth Avenue on Monday. Others had planned to dump Guinness beer from the shelves of the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the gay rights movement, in protest of the brewer's plan to sponsor the parade, but that demonstration was canceled late Sunday after Guinness said in a statement that it had dropped its sponsorship. Other beer companies joined the boycotts earlier, with Sam Adams withdrawing its sponsorship of Boston's parade and Heineken following suit in New York. New York's parade, a tradition that predates the city itself, draws more than 1 million spectators and about 200,000 participants every March 17. It has long been a mandatory stop on the city's political trail, and includes marching bands, traditional Irish dancers and thousands of uniformed city workers. ___ Associated Press writer Shawn Pogatchnik in Dublin contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"St. Patrick's Day parades in New York City and Boston faced controversies when Guinness and other major beer companies, Heineken and Sam Adams, pulled their sponsorships due to organizers' longstanding rule against gay and lesbian groups openly marching in the parade. The decision resulted in Ford Motor Company being the only major U.S. company to support the New York City parade. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh also did not participate in the parades due to the exclusion of gay and lesbian groups. Guinness stated that they have a strong history of supporting diversity and advocating for equality, and they hope for an inclusive policy in future parades. Despite the controversies, the parade in New York City was expected to draw more than 1 million spectators and 200,000 participants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Even if you know full well that you could never afford such an expensive vehicle, you don't forget the name, or the car. Why? You have been affected by product placement. Companies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples:Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ). Shampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers-anything can be product-placed. Advertisers value the mass appeal of the movies, knowing that a successful film can showcase their goods to hundreds of thousands of viewers. But when product placement takes over, artistic considerations can take a back seat. Cai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant. The movie contains product placement for airline companies. _ filmmakers often have to give less consideration to the quality of their work because they need money from advertisers. In the original story for Meteor Shower, the heroine's mother owned an ice cream shop. But no ice cream company wanted to sponsor the film. For this reason, the story was changed. In the film the man drinks 20 cups of milk tea instead of eating ice cream.

Dave Swarbrick, British Folk Fiddler, Dies at 75 Dave Swarbrick, a fiddler who electrified the British folk tradition as a member of the band Fairport Convention, died on Friday. He was 75. His death was announced on his website. The announcement did not say where he died or specify the cause, but he had emphysema for many years. Mr. Swarbrick and Fairport Convention were prime movers in trad-rock, which connected the 1960s ferment of folk-rock and psychedelia to a deep British heritage of storytelling ballads and nimble dance tunes. His fiddle playing had the deliberately rough-hewed sound of rural tradition; his tone could be sweet or scratchy, his phrases songful and melancholy or propulsive and gnarled with ornamental turns and quavers. He also sang, wrote songs and played viola, mandolin, mandola and guitar. Mr. Swarbrick was born in New Malden, Surrey, near London, on April 5, 1941. He learned to play fiddle as a child in Yorkshire. In the 1950s, the pianist Beryl Marriott heard him in a skiffle band and invited him to join her traditional Gaelic band, beginning a long association. By the early 1960s Mr. Swarbrick was being heard on the BBC series “Radio Ballads,” a mixture of oral history and music produced by the songwriter Ewan MacColl; he also recorded with Mr. MacColl, Peggy Seeger and other folk musicians. He appeared on seven albums with the Ian Campbell Folk Group in the early 1960s and in 1965 began recording with Martin Carthy, a leader of Britain’s folk revival. Mr. Swarbrick released his first solo album, “Rags, Reels and Airs,” in 1967. Fairport Convention, which had started as a folk-rock group strongly influenced by American styles, brought in Mr. Swarbrick as a sideman on the 1969 album “Unhalfbricking.” The Fairport version of the traditional song “A Sailor’s Life” emerged as an 11-minute maelstrom, with Mr. Swarbrick’s fiddle rising alongside Richard Thompson’s lead guitar, bringing echoes of past generations into the jam. For a pickup to amplify his instrument, Mr. Swarbrick recounted in the 2011 book “Electric Eden,” by Rob Young, “We smashed open a telephone and elastic-banded it to the fiddle.” Mr. Swarbrick switched to electric fiddle and joined Fairport Convention for its next album, “Liege & Lief,” also released in 1969. Merging rock instruments and riffs with traditional songs of love, war and murder, the album became a cornerstone of trad-rock. Fairport Convention’s lineup was perpetually unstable, and in the early 1970s Mr. Swarbrick took over more of the songwriting and lead singing. One of his major projects was Fairport’s 1971 concept album, “‘Babbacombe’ Lee,” about a Victorian convicted of murder who was freed after the gallows failed three times. Mr. Swarbrick was also a studio sideman on many British folk-rock recordings, and he continued to play more traditional music in the band Three Desperate Mortgages. The electric fiddle took a toll on Mr. Swarbrick’s hearing. By the end of the 1970s he was nearly deaf in one ear. He officially left Fairport Convention in 1984, although in 2007 he was part of a Fairport Convention lineup that reunited to perform “Liege & Lief” in concert. A smoker since his teens, Mr. Swarbrick struggled with failing health in the 1990s. He underwent three tracheotomies, and his emphysema grew so severe that at one point he needed oxygen onstage to perform. The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph mistakenly published an obituary for Mr. Swarbrick in 1999. “It’s not the first time I’ve died in Coventry,” he remarked afterward. A double lung transplant in 2004 improved his condition. He continued to make music, including a duo album with Mr. Carthy, “Straws in the Wind,” in 2006, and a final solo album, “Raison D’être” (2010), which gathered many of his collaborators through the decades. Mr. Swarbrick is survived by his wife, Jill Swarbrick-Banks; three children, Emily, Isobel and Alexander; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He lived in Coventry. In a 2001 interview with the online music magazine Innerviews, Mr. Swarbrick said he had long had the same goals: “To continue to be as expressive as I can and to not hold back, as well as not going over the top either. I would like to continue to expand my repertoire and do it all with integrity and the occasional whiskey.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Dave Swarbrick, a British folk fiddler, has passed away at the age of 75.

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation.

Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Testosterone can be broken up into 2 types, often referred to as T and DHT. DHT levels impact beard hair density, while T impacts beard hair thickness. Managing T and DHT levels under medical supervision may enhance your beard growth. Do not use testosterone-boosting pills, creams, injections, or other products without the advice and guidance of your doctor. There can be a range of unwanted side effects, and you could end up impeding beard growth. Your doctor may recommend engaging in regular strength-training sessions as a way to naturally boost testosterone levels. Rogaine, the most common brand name for minoxidil, is widely used to slow the progress of male pattern baldness. If applied to the face properly, it should help stimulate beard growth. However, even though Rogaine is available over the counter in many areas, you should always consult your doctor before using it on your face. This may be a better treatment option if you have patches where your beard doesn’t grow in well, as opposed to wanting your entire beard to grow in faster. If and when you stop treatment, any new hair growth may fall out. Microneedling involves rolling a device on your face that’s similar to a lint roller—except instead of sticky paper on the roller, it has hundreds of tiny needle points. Some advocates for micro-needling believe the tiny pinpricks stimulate the hair follicles and enhance beard growth. Some dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons use in-office micro-needling to address issues like acne. Talk to a medical professional you trust before undergoing micro-needling treatments or buying a device yourself. If used correctly, the process should be safe and relatively painless. However, it’s essential that the device is sanitized properly before each use according to the product instructions (usually by soaking it in alcohol). If there are areas of your beard that simply won’t grow in, hair transplants may be your only choice. As with top-of-the-head hair transplants, individual hair follicles are relocated from one area (like the back of the neck) to another (like your cheek). Hair transplants usually require multiple procedures that are both costly and time-consuming. It may take up to 2 years to see the full results, and the procedure doesn’t always work. Transplants may help fill in gaps in your beard, but it won’t make your beard grow faster.","completion":"Testosterone has 2 types, T and DHT. DHT helps make beard hair dense, and T makes it thick. With a doctor's help, you can manage these to grow your beard better. But don't use special pills, creams, or shots without a doctor's advice. They may cause problems. Your doctor may say it's okay to do muscle exercises to help boost testosterone. Rogaine is a common product that can help with beard growth, but always ask your doctor first. Microneedling is when you roll a tool with tiny needles on your face to help your beard grow. Talk to a medical person you trust before trying it. If some parts of your beard just don't grow, hair transplants may help. But it's a long, costly process and might not make your beard grow faster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is the content of an email: Jeff, Please accept my apologies for the slight delay in getting back to you on the message board regarding this week's API forecast. I'd like to take a minute of your time to highlight what we are doing to address all our concerns over our forecasts and how we are actively seeking to produce better results that we are all comfortable with and that provide useful insight and tradable information to our colleagues on the trading desks. As I am sure you know, forecasting the API's is not as scientific as other industry data such as the AGA's. The API is not consistently clear as to how it measures crude demand and this week's data is a clear example of this in that there is a discrepancy of 1.2 million b/d between crude runs and the demand figure shown by the API. Each week the basis of measuring crude demand changes slightly. To address this we are looking at finding ways of predicting what we call the API Curve Ball Factor through a variety of regressions / moving averages analysis. The second area we are in the process of perfecting is imports data. We are working closely with IT and Net Works to scrape real time shipping information in order to give us a better handle on crude coming in to the country. We are also recruiting a Quants PhD from Vince Kaminski's group who will be able to bring a slightly more scientific skill set to our team of business / economics skill sets. Please be assured that this issue is one we are giving the utmost priority to addressing. Having only recently taken on responsibility for the crude and products fundamentals team I have not had much opportunity to discuss issues with you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

EDM's 'summer of death' reporting is more than just tabloid raving In 2010, around the time of the last raves held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, former venue officials made the argument the parties there were no different than beer-fueled American football games held there. At the Los Angeles Rams’ season-opening home match at the Coliseum last weekend, at least 158 people were hospitalized for heat-related issues. (Temperatures were in the 90s.) But there was one huge difference: nobody died. Over the past 10 years there have been at least 25 drug-related deaths at parties hosted by just three LA-based rave promoters, the Los Angeles Times found. Parties such as Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) in Las Vegas have seen multiple drug-related deaths since moving there from the Coliseum in 2011. At Hard Summer this year, three patrons died. The cause is still under investigation. Last year two teenage girls died after attending Hard Summer. Both deaths were MDMA-related, coroner’s officials said. In the wake of these tragedies, and with a background of fewer venues willing to take risks on dance events, Hard announced it is not hosting its annual Day of the Dead festival in LA. Like in London, where one of the world’s greatest dance music venues, Fabric, appears to be no more due to factors triggered by the drug-related death of two teenagers in August, Los Angeles is in the midst of a rave crisis. Almost all of the city’s rave deaths are ecstasy-related, according to coroner’s conclusions. Yet for more than 20 years the electronic dance music scene has been blaming everything but itself – the media, “bad batch” pills, lack of party skills – for its drug problem. MDMA deaths have been constant here since the dawn of the 90s, when British ex-pats organized some of the first American raves in Los Angeles. In 1999 five teens died when the car they were in plunged off a mountain road following a rave(Ecstasy was one of the main drugs found in the victims’ bodies). Since those days the culture has returned to harm reduction as a means to combat the fatalities. DanceSafe, an organization that promotes health and safety within the electronic music community, believes ravers need a safe place to play where there’s plenty of free water, pill testing and space to cool down. Sounds reasonable. But pill testing, which has been embraced by some countries, can lead to a belief that ecstasy isn’t a cause in these deaths. Even the most celebrated MDMA scientists, such as the University of California Los Angeles’ Charles Grob, say ecstasy is problematic and unpredictable in a party setting. In the past five years there have been government task forces, free water, increased security and age limits of 18 and older. In the late 00s, operators of the San Francisco Bay Area’s Cow Palace tried harm reduction and found no improvement, with multiple hospitalizations. We’re fairly liberal in California. Marijuana is on the ballot this November and is likely to be fully legalized after 20 years of pioneering medical legitimacy. The so-called godfather of ecstasy, Sasha Shulgin, was a lifelong resident. We’re not opposed to fun. The important thing to acknowledge is that MDMA has a deadly record, like alcohol, heroin and cocaine. There are only two sure solutions when it comes to saving ravers’ lives: one, don’t hold raves. That’s not going to happen, and we don’t want it to. Two, make them 21 and older. None of the 25 deaths happened at 21-and-older events. Last year, following the 2015 deaths, Hard Day of the Dead went 21-plus. Nobody died. Of course, the crowds, estimated at 20,000, were fractional. Hard Summer saw about 147,000 people through the turnstiles this year. Yes, some of the deceased over the years have been older than 21, but barely. When 20-year-old Kenani Kaimuloa died after attending EDC Vegas this year, her father, an Iraq combat veteran, told a local newspaper reporter that he had been waiting for her to come home that weekend “to give me her Father’s Day present”. If 21-and-older works, then, why isn’t it done more often? What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the drug-related deaths at electronic dance music (EDM) events, particularly raves, and the ongoing crisis these events face due to such incidents.

Write a summary based on this article: At a business roundtable that Trump and Trudeau will attend with Canadian and American female executives in Washington Monday, the two countries will launch a joint task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. Trudeau took a big step to ease that acquaintance already. Trudeau’s aides reached out to Trump’s team and pitched an event that jibes with the prime minister’s emphasis on “women in the workplace” and Ivanka Trump’s commitment to advance women’s issues like child care and maternity leave in the workplace. Well, there’s a new guy in town now and the Canadians are working to take his measure on Monday, adjust their agenda and come to terms with the political phenomenon known as Donald Trump. There was pomp and ceremony on the front lawn, gracious toasts at a state dinner and Trudeau and the Canadian delegation basked in the welcome laid on by President Barack Obama last March. “That’s another world. That world is not here right now so you have to deal with a different world,” said former diplomat Paul Frazer. It is potentially a good sign for a visit that will look very different than the very warm reception Trudeau got from the Obamas in March. A PMO official said Trudeau had similarly advocated for the advancement of women in the workplace, especially at the executive level in China, in New York and at home and “is looking forward to being able to do this now in the White House. It seemed like a natural fit given their commitments” in Trump’s platform as well. Frazer says no other government has better prepared for the Trump administration than Canada , reaching out even before last November’s U.S. election to forge ties with his advisers in the possibility — though rare as it seemed back then — he might win. But that doesn’t mean this new reality is necessarily bad for Canada, he said. Justin Trudeau says when he meets with Donald Trump on Monday he expects to talk mostly about issues the U.S. and Canada \\"align on,\\" but the prime minister says he won't avoid subjects he disagrees on with the U.S. president. More recently, Trudeau shuffled his cabinet, dispatching foreign affairs minister Stéphane Dion to a diplomatic posting and installing Chrystia Freeland in his place, making retired army general Andrew Leslie a parliamentary secretary with special responsibility for cross-border ties and changing staff behind the scenes, all to put greater emphasis on Canada’s relations with the United States. Freeland will join Trudeau on his Monday trip to Washington, along with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau. “He’s done an enormous amount to get ready for this,” said Frazer, a former Canadian diplomat who now serves as a consultant in Washington. All that has laid the groundwork for Trudeau’s Oval Office tête-à-tête with Trump. In the “bloody chaotic town” that is Washington right now, the Monday meeting offers a respite for the Trump team to latch onto something that “actually works,” Frazer said. “Weeks into this rock and roll administration, I think the president is probably open to a little calm,” he said. Frazer’s advice? Don’t walk in with a list of grievances or complaints about Trump’s policies, such as his controversial immigration moves, at least not for the first meeting. Lay out the argument that keeping the border open and avoiding protectionist measures will help the economy and help boost the financial fortunes of the middle class in both countries. “Lay it out quickly. We don’t need long detailed policy memos here,” Frazer said. “Here’s what we’ve got and it’s better than anything else in the world and how do we make it better. Let’s not do anything to screw it up,” he said. “(Trump) responds well to facts, to a businesslike approach, kind of a roll-up-our-sleeves, ‘what is it you want, what is it I want,’ ” Frazer said. Trudeau suggested Friday that’s the very angle he’ll be taking when he sits down with Trump. “Relations between Canada and the United States are much deeper than just what is happening between a president and a prime minister. Obviously we’ll talk about jobs and growth for the middle class and we’ll find a lot of common ground,” the prime minister said during a visit to Yellowknife last week. Both sides have been working on “deliverables” for the meeting, concrete commitments they can point to as evidence that the two leaders did more than just talk. But for a first meeting, talk is important, too, especially as Trump’s early days in office have already left some world leaders unsettled, especially by his treatment of allies. The U.S. president drew fire for giving short shrift to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in a telephone call. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped his own White House visit in the continuing dispute over paying the cost of a wall along their shared border. But Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, got a warm reception when he met with Trump Friday at the White House. Abe had met once before with Trump, travelling to his New York apartment for a pre-inauguration visit with the incoming president. Trump declared Friday that he has a “good chemistry” with the Japanese leader. “I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that’s the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond,” he said, adding, “I’ll let you know if it changes.” During his joint news conference with Abe, Trump touched on themes that should encourage Canadians getting ready for their own meeting. He highlighted the importance of working together with Japan on “shared interests, of which we have many.” “We face numerous challenges and bilateral co-operation is essential. Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner,” Trump said. “We’re going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan,” the president said. That kind of language bolds well for Trudeau’s visit, who will be looking to tap similar sentiments with Trump and his cabinet team. And as one of the first leaders in to see the U.S. president, others on the world stage will be looking to Trudeau for his impressions and advice — lessons he will be able to impart later in the week when he travels to Germany and France to meet with European politicians. “What great timing for the Europeans to see him after he’s had his personal meeting with Trump and quietly give them a personal sense of what’s his takeaway,” Frazer said. ||||| FILE - In this Nov. 29, 2016 file photo, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a press conference at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario.

On Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, President Donald Trump... (Associated Press) OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump will participate in a roundtable discussion about women in the work force Monday, an early sign of cooperation as Trudeau seeks to have good relations so Canada is not targeted in trade talks. In his first face-to-face meeting with the new U.S president, Trudeau will also meet with Trump to talk about trade and participate in a working lunch. A White House official and a senior Canadian government official said the two countries plan to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The officials agreed to confirm the move only if they were not quoted by name because they were not authorized to make the information public. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter who has been an advocate for policies benefiting working women, was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the roundtable. Female executives from the United States and Canada are expected to participate. Trudeau's close cooperation with Trump and the first daughter could ease some worries among Canadians that the U.S. president will enact protectionist measures that could hurt the Canadian economy. It could also alleviate some fears that Trump will be as combative with Trudeau as he has been with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. The Canadian official said Trudeau's administration had suggested the task force, because the prime minister considers the issue of working women an important part of his agenda and economic growth plan. \\"It's a smart thing if Canada proposed this,\\" said Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto. \\"It takes attention off of NAFTA. And from Trump's point of view, it contributes to softening Trump's image, and he's got a problem with women.\\" Trudeau, 45, and Trump, 70, are polar opposites. Trudeau is a liberal who champions free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. He calls himself a feminist and his Cabinet is 50 percent women. Trump has few women in his Cabinet. He has taken a protectionist stance on trade and wants to crack down on the inflow of migrants and refugees. Trump's order to temporarily halt entry into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim nations, which is tied up in court, might come up during his bilateral meeting with Trudeau. But Trudeau is expected to focus on common economic interests. Relations with the U.S. are crucial as more than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S., while 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears among Canadians that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau, said the prime minister needs to build a relationship with Trump to ensure Canada is not. \\"The overriding priority will be for Canada to maintain secure and reliable access to the U.S. market and the supply chains that crisscross the border,\\" Paris said. Trudeau, whose father was the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has been preparing for the Trump meeting for months. He will also meet with legislative leaders on Capitol Hill. ___ Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Donald Trump are set to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs.

Richard Lester Meyers (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name Richard Hell, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer. Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor. Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism. Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books. Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"There are definitely other interesting aspects about this article. One noteworthy aspect is Richard Hell's diverse talents and interests, which extend beyond music into poetry, writing, and publishing. A quote from the article highlighting this range of activities is: \\"Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals.\\" Additionally, the collaboration between Hell and Verlaine in creating a fictional poet, Theresa Stern, displays their creativity and willingness to challenge norms. The quote, \\"In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity,\\" illustrates this unique aspect about Richard Hell's life and work. Furthermore, the article provides insights into Hell's early life, family background, and friendships that would later shape his career. This broader context helps to understand his development as an artist and his influence on the punk scene. Overall, the article not only highlights Richard Hell's musical achievements and influence on punk fashion but also delves into his multifaceted talents and personal history, adding depth to our understanding of this iconic figure in American punk culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The teenager hopes to follow her father into helping others despite his fate. She spoke as MP vote to join U.S.-led bombing campaign today. Article:","completion":"Title: Dragana and Bethany Haines Support Military Force Against ISIS Introduction: The family of late aid worker David Haines, who was brutally murdered by the terrorist group ISIS, has publicly expressed their support for military force against the extremist organization. Dragana Haines, the widow of David, and their 17-year-old daughter, Bethany, have called for the complete eradication of ISIS. As MPs vote today on whether the UK should join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, this grieving family bravely shares their story and the hope for a future where others will be saved from the fate of David Haines. David Haines' Tragic Capture and Murder: In March 2013, experienced aid worker David Haines was captured by ISIS militants in Syria. The father of two had dedicated his life to helping others, working tirelessly to improve the lives of vulnerable and suffering people in countries like Libya, Sudan, and former Yugoslavia. Tragically, in September 2014, Haines was brutally beheaded by jihadists, who proudly shared their horrific acts on the internet. His death shocked the world and marked the start of a chilling trend wherein the terrorist group executed a series of Western hostages in an attempt to instill fear and attract media attention. Family's Inspirational Response and Call for Action: Despite receiving personal threats from the terror group, Dragana Haines has maintained her courage and determination to ensure that her husband's killers are brought to justice. Both she and her daughter, Bethany, fully back the use of military force against ISIS. They have urged various governments not only to participate in the U.S.-led bombing campaign but also to collaborate in every way possible to destroy and eliminate the extremist organization. Bethany Haines has openly shared her desire to follow in her father's footsteps as a humanitarian worker, even though he endured such a cruel end. Rather than being deterred by his brutal death, the teenager remains steadfast in her mission to help those in need and work tirelessly for the betterment of societies facing severe hardship and crises such as those in Syria. UK Parliament's Vote and the Potential Impact: Today, as UK MPs vote on whether to join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, the plight of David Haines and his family serves as a strong argument in favor of taking swift and decisive action to stamp out the terrorist group. By joining the bombing efforts of the United States and other supportive nations, the UK could help weaken ISIS, save lives, and prevent future tragedies like the one suffered by the Haines family. In Conclusion: As the world grapples with the ongoing threat of ISIS, a courageous family like Dragana and Bethany Haines, facing the repercussions of terrorism, stand in inspirational defiance to the violent and oppressive organization. It is their courage and unwavering resolve against these terrorists that epitomise the resilience of the human spirit. As we witness the strength and determination of a mother and daughter who, despite their unimaginable losses, call for the eradication of ISIS, it is essential that the international community works in unison to defeat the terrorist group. Today's vote in the UK Parliament also serves as an opportunity to take a further step towards achieving this goal where we can ensure that people like David Haines, who worked tirelessly for making the world a better place, have not given their lives in vain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night.

A Wisconsin woman who already had three children and was desperate to have one with her new boyfriend was today charged with killing a pregnant mother, cutting out her baby and passing off the child as her own. The criminal complaint filed today details the horrific story behind the murder of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, who was expecting her fourth child that she had planned to name Omar. Her alleged killer, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, admitted she. had scoured the suburban Milwaukee neighbourhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant. woman whose child she could steal and call her own. Scroll down for video. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday. On October 6, she saw Maritza Ramirez-Cruz - a total stranger - and offered her a ride. When. she got in the car, however, Morales-Rodriguez said she needed to go. back to her home to change her shoes, and Ramirez-Cruz followed her in. to use the bathroom. It. was when she came out of the toilet that Morales-Rodriguez allegedly attacked her. with a baseball bat, striking her in the head several times. With. Ramirez-Cruz on the ground, her attacker choked her until she. passed out, and cut her open, attempting a Cesaerean section that she. had seen done on the Discovery Channel, according to the complaint. Suspect: Annette Morales-Rodriguez is accused of murdering Maritza Ramirez-Cruz then savagely cutting out her unborn child. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, bottom left, had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday. Morales-Rodriguez then hid the body in her basement. Later that evening, emergency services responded to a. call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had. just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the. criminal complaint. Indicted: Annette Morales-Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but,. after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the. woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth. Police Chief Edward Flynn said: 'During. the ensuing investigations, detectives determined that the 33-year-old. woman was not, in fact, the birth mother of the baby.' The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body. The medical examiner determined that Ramirez-Cruz likely died from excessive loss of blood. Local residents and neighbours have. been shocked by the brutal killing, and many cannot believe police have. the right person in custody. On Sunday night, the victim's husband, Christian Mercado, told WTMJ that his wife was a 'good person.' Because he doesn't speak English, Mr Mercado's stepmother Darla Guiterrez translated for him. She said: 'We still can't believe it. We know it's true but we can't believe it and the whole family is taking it real hard.' Jacqueline Bonilla, whose daughter lives next-door to Morales-Rodriguez, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 'She was acting like she was [pregnant]. Grief: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz's husband Christian Mercado is shocked by her death, and says she was a 'good person' 'She'd push her belly out and I'd say, \\"Oh, she's pregnant.\\"' Another neighbour, Keila Perez, claimed the Morales-Rodriguez is the godmother to her daughter. 'From what I know she had a baby, she had baby stuff in there, she has a car seat and everything in there. I don't know what the hell is going on.' Morales-Rodriguez lived in the property with a man and her three children, but police said no-one else is being considered as an accomplice. Neighbours said Morales-Rodriguez claimed to have been pregnant for months. Police tape: The home where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lived in suburban Milwaukee remains blocked off after police found the body of 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz in the basement. Crime scene: The house near 7th and Mitchell streets, where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lives with her boyfriend and three children. Ms Perez said Morales-Rodriguez had been talking about pregnancy, and had even shown her a sonogram of the baby. She claimed she was expecting to deliver the baby by Caesarean section in the coming weeks but had called Ms Perez around noon on Thursday to say she was having contractions. She said the woman's three other children ranged in age from five to 14, and her current boyfriend was not their father. She added that Morales-Rodriguez had lived in the neighbourhood for seven years, after moving from Puerto Rico. Similar cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004. In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death. Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb. Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull. Disbelief: Shocked neighbours say the suspect lives with three of her children in the house where the body was found.","completion":"A shocking case has emerged from Wisconsin, where a woman, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, has been charged with killing a pregnant mother, Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, and stealing her unborn child.

Information: - A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.

The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Mestizos are usually considered to be mixed Spaniards by the crown of Spain. - Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form.

Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another. - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank.

Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks. - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.

Paul Verhoeven was born on 18 July 1938, the son of a school teacher, Wim Verhoeven, and a hat maker, Nel van Schaardenburg. Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy. Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews. Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017. In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.

Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. For the most effective startup, focus on a particular genre to build your reputation. This focus will be determined in large part by what you wish to accomplish. If your goal is to make a lot of money, then you'll focus on popular music. If your goal is to be the go-to label for 21st century post avant jazzcore, your focus and approach will be much different. This is needed on many levels. First and foremost, you will build the framework of your label: how you plan on finding and developing talent, your marketing and promotion avenues, how you understand the market and the competition, how you plan on financing your venture, and how you intend on making this a profitable business. If you're independently wealthy, then you may not need investors, at least for the monetary backing. However, you may wish to attract investors who can help you build credibility in your market. For example, if you started a pop music label with your own cash, but were able to convince Sir Paul McCartney to invest in your label, that would be a huge win for your label. To do that, though, you will need a credible plan that shows Sir Paul, or any other investor, that you know what you are doing. Should you need financial backing, having a plan that shows that you understand both the rewards and the risks, and that you have been able to determine a way forward, will go a long way in convincing an investor to risk his capital on your venture. That will include everything from staples to electricity to recording and production costs. Be very thorough when you do this: people who might consider becoming involved in your label will certainly be, when they read your plan! Here are some things to take into account: Administrative costs: rent, utilities, taxes, and licenses are right up front and can be significant. Don't forget to include phone, internet, printers, paper, computers, business cards, and office supplies in this list. You will also need a website, as well as somebody to both create and maintain it. Some of these costs will be weekly, some monthly, and some that only happen every year or two. It may seem like a lot at first, but if you create a five-year plan, you should be able to chart out how these costs will eventually become a small percentage of the overall financial picture. Recording costs: as a record label, you're going to be producing acts. That means you need to account for the recording chain, including studio time, the fees for the engineer and producer (which may be you, but you need to get paid too), mixing engineers, and studio musicians. Marketing budget: a great recording is nothing until it's actually in the market. To do that, you're going to need to promote your label through online ads, magazine ads, press releases, and your website. You will also need to work with artists and designers to create your logo, packaging standards, and overall design plan. Professional services: while you're busy making beautiful music, somebody needs to take care of writing clear, effective legal contracts both for your talent, and for your business deals. For that, you will want the services of a qualified attorney who specializes in the music business. You'll also want an accountant to make sure that you friendly tax collector doesn't come to call. You need people that you can trust and rely on. Planning a cash flow forecast for one, three, and five years out requires some skill, some savvy, and some educated guesswork. The first year should be a very solid plan: you will have a good idea of your startup costs already, and you will likely have in mind (and made contact with) a few bands who will be the first on your roster. Using this information, determine how much you'll be spending, and a projection about how much these acts will bring in. For example, you can base this on how the bands are doing currently: Do they pack clubs? Their music has a good track record, and will probably perform well. If you also have bands that are brand new, and don't have a fan base to work from, you'll have to do significantly more promotion to get the word out. As you add more bands to your roster, your income potential will continue to grow. As you plan for years three to five in your forecast, you will need to determine how and when you will add more talent, and how you will promote them. This is where prediction gets a little more complicated: a great band on your roster may make it much easier for you to promote all the bands on your roster. Similarly, a poorly-performing band will be a cash drain that can lead to financial struggles. Unless you're supremely talented in sales, marketing, music, business, art, conversation, and moonlight as a lawyer, you're going to want to develop a team. Here are some key skill sets that will enable your success: Marketing and sales: somebody who can get out there and promote your label, who knows the industry, and has a personal relationship with artists, promoters, and people who like to support the arts financially. This person or persons will be key to your success: they're responsible for bringing talent in, and getting the word out. The better they perform, the more successful you'll be. Production. You'll need somebody who understands the recording process inside and out, who can find or develop good engineers, mixers, and producers, and who can run a recording session. Contract help. To keep costs down, at least at first, consider hiring other staff on a per-job basis. This would include logo and graphic design, legal, accounting, engineering, and other needs that only occur from time to time. Summary:","completion":"1.

Write an article based on this summary: Two-year-old Alice does not like meat and only eats broccoli with ketchup, but scientists researching toddlers' eating habits do not blame her parents.","completion":"Title: Tackling Toddler Eating Habits: Beyond Parenting Introduction Two-year-old Alice may not like meat and prefer her broccoli with a side of ketchup, but according to recent scientific research, her eating habits should not be seen as a reflection of her parents' culinary skills or parenting approach. In this article, we dive into the fascinating world of toddlers' eating habits and investigate the reasons behind their peculiar preferences, dietary challenges faced by parents, and strategies to encourage a well-rounded diet. Understanding the Picky Eater When toddlers begin their journey into the world of solid foods, their taste buds can be quite unpredictable. Vegetables smothered in cheese or fruits dipped in yogurt might become a favorite, while meat might be met with disdain. In many cases, parents are not to blame for their children's preferences. Researchers suggest that taste preferences may be formed in infancy, which means that what babies were exposed to during their first months of life could play a role in their likes and dislikes. Genetics, too, can influence a child's taste preferences. Some children may have a higher sensitivity to bitter flavors, which is why they may avoid vegetables like broccoli or sprouts, while some may be more drawn to sweet flavors, leading to a preference for fruits or treats. The Role of Environment and Culture Environmental factors also play a huge part in shaping a child's taste preferences and eating habits. Cultural norms, family customs, and regional cuisines contribute to the types of foods that toddlers are exposed to. For instance, a child who grows up in a Mediterranean household is more likely to develop a taste for olives, tomatoes, and fish compared to a child growing up in a more meat-centric American household. In addition to this, toddlers, in general, enjoy imitating others in their environment, which significantly influences their food choices. When they observe family members, friends, and peers enjoying a particular food, they are more likely to try it themselves. Strategies to Encourage Better Eating Habits Acknowledging that toddlers' eating habits are not solely a consequence of parenting can help pave the way for more creative and effective strategies in cultivating healthier eating behaviors. 1. Repeated exposure: Patience and persistence are key when introducing new foods to a toddler. It may take multiple attempts, sometimes over a month, before a toddler feels comfortable enough to consistently accept a new food. The trick is to repeatedly expose them to a variety of foods in a pressure-free environment. 2. Presentation matters: Toddlers are often more inclined to try foods if they are presented in an appealing manner. This could involve cutting up fruits or vegetables in fun shapes, arranging them colorfully on the plate, or coming up with creative names. 3. Involvement in meal preparation: Young children who help prepare meals may be more interested in trying the foods they've helped to create. Activities like washing fruits and vegetables, stirring, or putting toppings on a dish can all engage a toddler in meal preparation. 4. Encourage family meals: Eating together as a family helps to create healthy eating habits, as well as a sense of routine and comfort in trying new foods. Toddlers learn by observing their family members and may be more likely to partake in eating a meal when they see others enjoying it. 5. Addressing sensory concerns: Some toddlers may not like certain foods because of their texture or appearance. In such cases, it may help to modify the food's texture, like blending it, altering the cooking method, or mixing it with other familiar foods. Conclusion In conclusion, it is essential for parents not to feel discouraged, nor blame themselves or their culinary prowess for their toddlers' eccentric eating habits. Evidence suggests that several factors can contribute to a child's food preferences, including genetics, early infancy exposure, environment, and cultural norms. By incorporating patience, creativity, and a variety of approaches, parents can help introduce their toddlers to a diverse and healthy array of foods. Remember, like the story of Alice, even if broccoli is only enjoyed with a dollop of ketchup, the key is to appreciate the colorful journey through the culinary world with your little ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve.

The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent.

Plot title: Babes in Toyland Movie plot: Lisa Piper (Drew Barrymore), an eleven-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio, takes care of her siblings and cooks for her family. She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night. Barnaby, having lost control of his creatures and having failed at making Lisa his new Trollog, is then banished from Toyland. Jack and Mary are then married.

A:","completion":"From the provided plot of \\"Babes in Toyland,\\" it's not shown that the children sneak away into the forest. The main characters - Lisa Piper, Mary Contrary, Jack Nimble, and Georgie Porgie - do engage in several actions to counter the nefarious plans of the antagonist, Barnaby Barnacle, though none of these involved sneaking away into a forest. These actions included stopping a forced wedding, escaping from Barnaby's clutches multiple times, including from his hidden fortress, countering Barnaby's attempt to corrupt them using a flask of distilled evil, seeking help from the Toymaster/Santa Claus, and ultimately, with the belief of Lisa Piper as the catalyst, animating a life-sized army of toy soldiers to defend Toyland from an army of trolls engineered by Barnaby. The only reference to a forest in the provided plot is 'the Forest of the Night,' into which Barnaby was driven and subsequently banished following his failure to take over Toyland.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Now, I have a new situation: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. Answer this question please: Who is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we will consider the given background information and the new situation to determine which individual is exposed to more dangerous sounds. Step 1: Understand the relationship between decibel levels and sound intensity. As mentioned in the background, for every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. High-decibel sounds have more intensity and are potentially damaging to the ears and can cause hearing loss. Step 2: Consider the working environments of Jeremy and Alexander. Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. These machines are known to produce high-decibel sounds. Alexander works in a library, where he is frequently exposed to low-decibel sounds. Step 3: Compare the sound exposure of Jeremy and Alexander. Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds in his work environment. Meanwhile, Alexander is exposed to low-decibel sounds in his work environment. High-decibel sounds are dangerous, as mentioned in the background information. Step 4: Determine who has a higher risk of exposure to dangerous sounds. Since Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds due to operating heavy machinery in his work environment, he is more likely to be exposed to dangerous sounds that could damage his ears and cause hearing loss.

Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - Sonata (Italian: , pl. \\"sonate\\"; from Latin and Italian: \\"sonare\\", \\"to sound\\"), in music, literally means a piece \\"played\\" as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\"), a piece \\"sung\\". The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure. - A Scots Quair is a trilogy by the Scottish writer Lewis Grassic Gibbon , describing the life of Chris Guthrie , a woman from the north east of Scotland during the early 20th century . It consists of three novels : Sunset Song ( 1932 ) , Cloud Howe ( 1933 ) , and Grey Granite ( 1934 ) . The first is widely regarded as an important classic ( voted Scotland 's favourite book in a 2005 poll supported by the Scottish Book Trust and other organisations ) but opinions are more varied about the other two . - A trilogy (from Greek - \\"\\", \\"three\\" and - \\"-logia\\", \\"discourse\\") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, or video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term \\"trilogy.\\" - Lewis Grassic Gibbon was the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell (13 February 1901 7 February 1935), a Scottish writer.

They do n't spend money on consumer goods at Wal - Mart and Target . They tend to save their money . Question: Am I in support of tax breaks for the wealthy ?","completion":"Based on your statements, it is clear that you are not in support of tax breaks for the wealthy. You have expressed your disagreement with the benefits that tax breaks for the wealthy are supposed to provide to the economy. You believe that since the wealthy do not tend to spend their money on consumer goods at stores such as Wal-Mart and Target, their tax breaks do not have a meaningful impact on economic growth. Furthermore, you have mentioned your dissatisfaction with the current state of financial assistance provided by the government, specifically the 600 stimulus checks. This implies that you believe more support should be offered to those who may be in need of it, rather than giving tax breaks to wealthier individuals who may not be investing that money back into the economy in a meaningful way. In addition, it is important to understand that individuals have different opinions on the effectiveness and fairness of tax breaks for the wealthy. Many argue that these tax breaks are essential for encouraging businesses to grow and create jobs, which can subsequently lead to economic growth. On the other hand, others argue that such tax breaks only serve to widen the wealth gap and cause socioeconomic disparities, as those with higher incomes might have a greater capacity to save and invest their additional income, rather than spending it on consumer goods or other activities that could stimulate the economy. It is evident from your statements that you side with the latter argument, believing that tax breaks for the wealthy do not provide sufficient economic benefits to warrant their existence. Instead, you might propose solutions such as increasing financial assistance to those in need, or advocating for policies that ensure a fairer distribution of wealth and resources within society. This could involve progressive tax policies, social safety nets, or investments in education and workforce development to create opportunities for economic mobility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the lungs are functioning normally, the oxygen exchange between the alveoli and the capillaries is not hindered, allowing for proper gas exchange. The walls of the alveoli are intact, and there is no narrowing or blockage in the airways, which contributes to a more effective oxygen transfer, and ultimately more oxygen reaching the bloodstream. As for the supposed perturbation and its influence on the second effect (oxygen going into the bloodstream), if the person does not have COPD, there would likely be no perturbation or negative effect on the oxygen delivery to the blood. Instead, the person's respiratory system would function as expected, enabling a greater amount of oxygen to reach the blood and thus having a positive impact on overall oxygenation levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Q: Review: After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as Zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!! All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I'll attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie #1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie #1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie #2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into Zombie #1's grave is never explained. (Considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, I'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his \\"normal\\" form until his business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie #1 ??? We can only assume Zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie #1. (This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are). Then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?)Meanwhile, Zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover John Ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. Upon seeing it's only Zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland's revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. Taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots). Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie #1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie #1.Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie #1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie #1's bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him (and the audience), Zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last we see of Zombie #1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones \\"mirror\\" the old ones. How profound.Zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). Zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie #1) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave.The viewer is left wondering: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie #1's grave? Why is Zombie #2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine -- where's he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave... If this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused, don't worry cause you're not alone. Question: is it a negative review? A:","completion":"Yes, this is a negative review. The reviewer expresses confusion regarding the plot, a lack of explanation for some characters' behaviors, a lack of urgency in the characters' actions despite life-threatening circumstances, and seemingly illogical scenes. The reviewer also questions the logic behind a zombie's transformation process, the identity of certain zombies, and the residency of a grave. There are significant criticisms about the film and no positive comments made about it, which suggests a negative sentiment towards the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Don think i'm gunna even go n the control room wen i get 2 the stu [Kydnice] What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as a mix of tiredness, impatience, and unenthusiastic feelings. The author of the tweet starts by describing their current situation, sitting in the waiting room, waiting for someone named Boogz. This statement is neutral, simply setting the scene for the reader. However, the author's feeling of tiredness is expressed in the next sentence with \\"i'm super tired!\\" The use of 'super' in this context serves to emphasize the extent of the author's fatigue. The author then follows up on this sentiment of tiredness by mentioning that they don't think they will go into the control room when they arrive at the \\"stu\\", which is presumably a shorthand term for 'studio'. This reinforces the level of exhaustion or lack of energy the author is experiencing, as they are not just physically tired, but also feeling unenthusiastic about their upcoming task or activity. Additionally, the use of the casual language, informal contractions, and shorthand adds a sense of spontaneity to the tweet, reflecting the author's mood, and possibly suggesting impatience as they await Boogz's arrival. The overall sentiment is therefore a blend of tiredness, impatience, and reluctance or lack of enthusiasm for the subsequent activity in the control room."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible answers: very happy to miss work, in pain, delighted to be sick The answer is:","completion":"To find the answer to this question, we can examine the context and possible answers, relating them to Jordan's situation of being ill and admitted to the hospital. Step 1: Analyze the context Jordan got ill yesterday and had to be admitted into the hospital, missing work today. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers, relating them to the context a) Very happy to miss work: This answer seems unlikely because Jordan was ill and had to be admitted to the hospital. It would be more plausible if Jordan wasn't truly sick or was avoiding a responsibility at work. b) In pain: This answer is more likely, given that Jordan was ill and required hospitalization. It is common for people to feel pain or discomfort when they're sick. c) Delighted to be sick: This answer is similar to the first one and seems unlikely, considering that being sick to the point of needing hospitalization generally isn't a pleasant experience. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer, based on the evaluation Based on the evaluation of the possible answers, the most appropriate answer is: In pain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Who wrote first, Droysen or Arnold?\\" Context: \\"\\"Hellenistic\\" is a modern word and a 19th-century concept; the idea of a Hellenistic period did not exist in Ancient Greece. Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"J.
