The process is quite straightforward and can be done using everyday objects found in your household! In this article, we show you how to find an approximation of Pi by measuring the circumferences and diameters of circular containers or lids. This activity provides a practical understanding of Pi, making the concept more accessible and engaging for everyone. Materials: 1. Four different sizes of circular containers or lids 2. A non-stretchy, non-kinky string 3. A meter-stick, yardstick, or ruler 4. A marker Procedure: Step 1: Number the circular containers (or lids) from 1 to 4. This will help you keep track of your measurements later. Step 2: Get a non-stretchy, non-kinky string and use a marker to mark its beginning point. The string should be long enough to be wrapped around the circular items. Step 3: Measure the circumference by wrapping the string snugly around the edge of each of the four circular items. Be sure to mark the point on the string where the beginning point meets the edge. Step 4: Straighten and measure the marked part of the string using a meter-stick, yardstick, or ruler to record the circumference in decimals for each container. Step 5: Turn the circular containers upside down so you can find and mark the center on the bottom of each container. Step 6: Measure the diameter by stretching the ruler or straight edge from one side of the circle across the center to the other side, marking the end point on the string. Step 7: Record your measured diameter in decimals for each container. Step 8: Create a chart or table with two columns – one for the circumference and one for the diameter – and fill it in with the measured values. Step 9: Divide each circumference by the same circle's diameter to obtain a ratio. Note down all the results. Step 10: Calculate the average of the four ratios by summing up the values and dividing by 4. Now, you should have a reasonably accurate approximation of Pi (π). While this experiment may not give you the most precise value of Pi, it helps illustrate the relationship between the circumference and diameter of a circle, creating a real-world connection to the concept. So, why not grab some circular objects, a measuring tool, and a piece of string to enjoy this hands-on mathematical adventure? The process is not only educational but will also be a fun experience for students and curious learners alike.

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.\\" \\"This research shows how...

NPR produces and distributes news and cultural programming. Individual public radio stations are not required to broadcast all NPR programs that are produced. Most public radio stations broadcast a mixture of NPR programs, content from rival providers American Public Media, Public Radio International, Public Radio Exchange and WNYC Studios and locally produced programs. NPR's flagships are two drive time news broadcasts, \\"Morning Edition\\" and the afternoon \\"All Things Considered\\"; both are carried by most NPR member stations, and are two of the most popular radio programs in the country.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you are watchful, you may be able to simply spray cats with a water hose whenever they are trying to use your garden. Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently drive them away. Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enough—there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats. Motion-activated sprinklers are available from home supply stores. When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your garden. These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs. These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear. These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your garden. Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them out of your garden.","completion":"The article provides various methods to deter and keep cats away from your garden, such as using a gentle spray of water, employing motion-activated sprinklers, utilizing ultrasonic devices, and having a dog to create a sense of insecurity for the cats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

Which glacier would have thinner ice? Mike likes to visit places. This winter he is visiting Greenland. First, he visited Lake A, which is very small. Then he visited Lake B, which is huge. While visiting Lake B he went to a local pub. There he heard other tourists talking about two nearby glaciers, glacier C and glacier D. They said that glacier C had a snowfall and the snow became part of the glacier, but glacier D didn't have any snowfall. Mike is getting ready to visit those glaciers. Hint: Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue. Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue. Answer:","completion":"Glacier D would have thinner ice. This is because, as mentioned in the paragraph, glacier C had a snowfall and the snow became part of the glacier. This would result in the formation of more layers of compressed ice in glacier C. On the other hand, glacier D didn't have any snowfall, so there is no addition of snow layers to be compressed and contribute to the thickness of its ice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States. - Emotion, in everyday speech, is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure. Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition. - Guadalajara is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Jalisco, and the seat of the municipality of Guadalajara.

The correct process is as follows: 1. Air is drawn in through the mouth or nose. 2. The air travels through the trachea. 3. The air moves into the bronchi, which branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles. 4. The air finally reaches the alveoli, small air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. 5.

Increased soil pH may influence plant growth and, in turn, photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants utilize sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. If an increase in soil pH affects plant growth positively, this may lead to increased oxygen production. However, this increased oxygen availability would not specifically impact the steps in the human respiratory process mentioned above. To summarize, a higher soil pH may indirectly impact oxygen availability in the environment by affecting plant growth and photosynthesis, but it will not directly impact the respiratory processes within the human body responsible for oxygen intake and delivery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

September 18, 2017 Factbox: Egypt and North Korea By Margaret Suter On September 12, during a visit to Seoul, South Korea, Egypt’s Defense Minister reportedly announced that Egypt would be severing military ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea. The alleged announcement and subsequent speculation, which was not immediately confirmed by the Egyptian government, comes as the United States and other members of the international community have repeatedly called on the Egyptian government to cut ties with the isolated hermit state.The official South Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported that Egypt had already cut ties with the DPRK according to the Egyptian Defense Minister Sedki Sobhi. Confusion over the validity of the remarks arose when Egypt’s government neither confirmed nor denied the report. According to Yonhap, Sobhi reportedly said, “Egypt will actively cooperate with South Korea against North Korea acts that threaten peace.”When reached for comment, the Egyptian Army’s official spokesperson, Tamer El Refeai, told Egypt Independent that all the details pertaining to Sobhi’s visit to South Korea were listed on the spokesperson’s official Facebook page . However, the Facebook statement did not include any information on the state of ties between Egypt and North Korea. Several Egyptian news outlets included Sobhi’s comments in their write-ups about the trip, only to remove them later. The daily newspaper, El-Masry El-Youm, initially published his comments in its print edition, but removed them in later iterations.The lack of clarity surrounding the veracity of the comments creates further pressure for the Egyptian government, which has faced increasing demands by one of its main allies and sources of foreign aid, the United States, to scale back its economic ties to North Korea. On August 22, the Trump administration announced its intention to cut 96 million in aid and delay 195 million in military funding to Egypt, citing concerns over Egypt’s human rights record. However, other reports have speculated that the move was part of a broader administration strategy to pressure Egypt into severing ties with the DPRK, further isolating the state from one of its key trading partners.When asked about the decision, a State Department official reportedly said that issues of concern were raised with Cairo, but refused to verify whether Egypt’s relationship with North Korea had factored into the decision.Egypt has long maintained a relationship with the isolated regime in Pyongyang, especially in the arms trade . Egyptian policymakers have viewed North Korea as a key source of military technology since the 1970s when, following North Korea’s support for Egypt in the Yom Kippur War, then-President Anwar Al Sadat agreed to sell Soviet-produced Scud-B missiles to North Korea from 1976-1981. The DPRK returned the favor by supplying technological assistance to Egypt’s missile production.Despite changes in successive governments, Egypt has sustained the arms trade with North Korea. As recently as 2015, the United Nations issued a report confirming that the North Korean Ocean Maritime Management Company (OMM) was a central player in arranging the illicit shipment of concealed arms via individuals and entities based in Egypt, as well as other countries. The report stated that OMM representatives were stationed with a company called the Sunlight Agency in Port Said until at least 2011. In February 2017, UN investigators stated they had uncovered evidence of North Korean trade in “hitherto unreported items such as encrypted military communications, man-portable air defense systems, air defense systems and satellite-guided missiles” in the Middle East and Africa, among other regions. Investigators added that in August 2016, Egypt intercepted a North Korean vessel laden with thirty thousand PG-7 rocket-propelled grenades hidden in wooden crates.In addition to its ongoing military ties, Egypt has maintained a strong economic relationship with the DPRK, as demonstrated by the approximately twenty economic, security, media, technology and cultural agreements established and ongoing with the regime. In 2008, Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom helped set up the DPRK’s first and only 3G mobile phone network, a deal which Orascom’s billionaire business tycoon Naguib Sawiris oversaw. While critics have questioned whether the arrangement violated UN sanctions and embargos, Sawiris maintains that he has obeyed all UN resolutions and is not in violation of sanctions. The deal reportedly supplied Orascom with 300,000 new North Korean customers and spurred further Egyptian investments in North Korea’s economy. The Egyptian State Information Service, the government’s official channel, states “the volume of the Egyptian Orascom Group’s direct investments in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has exceeded half a billion dollars, which puts Egyptian investments at the top of the pyramid of foreign investments in Korea.” For its part, North Korea exports various goods to Egypt including cars, plastics, and rubbers among others.Cairo has also maintained close diplomatic times with the DPRK, one of three Arab countries (including Syria and Palestine) that operates an embassy in Pyongyang. In addition, Egypt is “one of only five Arab countries to host a North Korean Embassy on its territory, the other countries being Syria, Algeria, Kuwait and Libya.” In 2015, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to attend the grand opening of the re-designed Suez Canal, who dispatched the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, Kim Yong-nam to attend in his absence.While Egypt’s government has condemned several of the North Korean regime’s recent nuclear tests, in a 2016 television interview , a military spokesman attributed the condemnations to Egypt’s role on the UN Security Council and the need to take a principled stance against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. When questioned about continued US demands for Egypt to shutter its ties with the DPRK, Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid told Al-Monitor, “Egypt is managing its relations with foreign countries based on its own interests and priorities without taking into account any pressures that may hinder the independence of its national decision.” Yet recently, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2371 with a “yes” vote from Egypt, a signal that Egypt supports much tougher sanctions against North Korea despite the two countries’ long-standing economic and military ties.At the same time, Defense Minister Sobhi’s recent trip to South Korea was meant to show Egypt’s commitment to South Korea, with the aim of boosting military ties between the two countries. With no confirmation as of yet regarding a possible severing of relations with the DPRK, Egypt may be attempting to have its cake and eat it too; however, the recent decision by the Trump Administration to withhold and delay critical aid may be more than Egypt’s fragile economy can endure. Given its relatively weak bargaining power and its substantial and longstanding dependence on its alliance with the US, Egypt may soon succumb to US pressure by officially confirming the severing of ties with North Korea. While the stakes of cutting these ties remain high, the risk of losing a stable and secure partnership with its closest western ally may just be enough to prod Egypt’s reluctance.is an MA graduate from the American University School of International Service International Affairs Program.

Despite increased transparency among the 55% of nations who trade in small arms, the 6bn (£4.5bn) market remains a murky industry in which weapons find their way into the hands of terrorists or are used by states to carry out human rights abuses, according to the Small Arms Survey Trade Update 2017. Where nations are secretive, evidence is garnered from reports of weapons seizures, including huge hauls from North Korea and Iran. Two North Korean shipments to Syria intercepted in six months, UN told Read more In August last year a North Korean vessel was intercepted in Egypt. On board, hidden beneath 2,300 tonnes of iron ore, were 30,000 PG-7 rocket-propelled grenades and their sub components. Suspected North Korean exports of small arms worth 18m and destined for Iran were also intercepted on a plane in Thailand in 2009. “Such seizures … coupled with other documented small arms trade activities, are sufficient to justify North Korea’s status as a major small arms exporter,” the report said. “Although Iran, North Korea, and the UAE rarely, if ever, recorded small arms exports worth 10m or more ... survey research indicates that they are major small arms exporters. It is more difficult to determine the status of Saudi Arabia, which appears to be a significant re-exporter of small arms.” Tens of thousands of rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and more than 350 million rounds of ammunition were exported by eight central and south-east European states to Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2015, the report said. Such shipments were sent to military bases in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and then re-exported to non-Saudi forces in Yemen and Syria. “Such information indicates that Saudi Arabia also re-exports significant quantities of small arms to armed forces and non-state actors in the Middle East,” the report says. Irene Pavesi, researcher on the Small Arms Survey, said: “The concealed nature of the small arms trade increases the chances that the transferred weapons will end up in the wrong hands, and help fuel conflict, insecurity and instability around the world.” Analysis of the flow of deadly weaponry across the globe by the experts based in Geneva also shows: Brazil has for the first time emerged as among the top five exporters of machine guns, rockets mortars, and other small arms, along with the US, Germany, South Korea and Italy. The UK is among the top importers of small arms, its trade increased by 18% between 2013 and 2014 to reach 109m, mostly for the civilian market. Weapons exported or re-exported from North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE are getting into the hands of armed militant groups in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq was among the top 10 importers of small arms in 2014 in a trade worth 139m, up from 10m in 2013. The US remains the world’s largest exporter of small arms, with exports worth 1.1bn in 2014. Even nations which aim to be transparent and above board can see weapons fall into the wrong hands. A UN report earlier this year revealed Brazilian weapons makers shipped handguns which were supposed to be destined for Djibouti to a Yemeni arms dealer three months after the imposition of an arms embargo. I’ve seen how arms sales fuel deadly suffering in Yemen. We must stop them | Radhya al-Mutawakel Read more In 2015 – the year of the Bataclan, Bardo museum and Charlie Hebdo attacks – there were more terrorist attacks carried out with Kalashnikovs than any other weaponry, raising huge concerns about how the legal weapons can end up on the illicit market and in the hands of terrorists. Paul Holtom, of the Small Arms Survey said there was still a lack of transparency in the industry. “We know that complete transparency is not possible, but as a public watchdog our role is to make sure the trade in small arms is not supplying weapons that are going to end up in the hands of terrorists. At the moment we cannot say that.” In July campaigners against the arms trade lost a case in the UK high court calling for Britain to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of concerns over the civilian toll of its two-year bombing campaign in Yemen.

Here are a few key tests under Kim Jong Un’s rule and the resulting U.N. Security Council sanctions. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has advanced its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon technology at an unprecedented rate. Here are a few key tests under Kim Jong Un’s rule and the resulting U.N. Security Council sanctions. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) Last August, a secret message was passed from Washington to Cairo warning about a mysterious vessel steaming toward the Suez Canal. The bulk freighter named Jie Shun was flying Cambodian colors but had sailed from North Korea, the warning said, with a North Korean crew and an unknown cargo shrouded by heavy tarps. Armed with this tip, customs agents were waiting when the ship entered Egyptian waters. They swarmed the vessel and discovered, concealed under bins of iron ore, a cache of more than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades. It was, as a United Nations report later concluded, the “largest seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.” But who were the rockets for? The Jie Shun’s final secret would take months to resolve and would yield perhaps the biggest surprise of all: The buyers were the Egyptians themselves. A U.N. investigation uncovered a complex arrangement in which Egyptian business executives ordered millions of dollars worth of North Korean rockets for the country’s military while also taking pains to keep the transaction hidden, according to U.S. officials and Western diplomats familiar with the findings. The incident, many details of which were never publicly revealed, prompted the latest in a series of intense, if private, U.S. complaints over Egyptian efforts to obtain banned military hardware from Pyongyang, the officials said. It also shed light on a little-understood global arms trade that has become an increasingly vital financial lifeline for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the wake of unprecedented economic sanctions. President Trump tweeted Sunday, Oct. 1, saying he told Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with North Korea. (Reuters) [Do sanctions against North Korea work?] A statement from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington pointed to Egypt’s “transparency” and cooperation with U.N. officials in finding and destroying the contraband. “Egypt will continue to abide by all Security Council resolutions and will always be in conformity with these resolutions as they restrain military purchases from North Korea,” the statement said. But U.S. officials confirmed that delivery of the rockets was foiled only when U.S. intelligence agencies spotted the vessel and alerted Egyptian authorities through diplomatic channels — essentially forcing them to take action — said current and former U.S. officials and diplomats briefed on the events. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. and U.N. findings, said the Jie Shun episode was one of a series of clandestine deals that led the Trump administration to freeze or delay nearly 300 million in military aid to Egypt over the summer. Whether North Korea was ever paid for the estimated 23 million rocket shipment is unclear. But the episode illustrates one of the key challenges faced by world leaders in seeking to change North Korea’s behavior through economic pressure. Even as the United States and its allies pile on the sanctions, Kim continues to quietly reap profits from selling cheap conventional weapons and military hardware to a list of customers and beneficiaries that has at times included Iran, Burma, Cuba, Syria, Eritrea and at least two terrorist groups, as well as key U.S. allies such as Egypt, analysts said. [How has North Korea managed to make rapid gains in its missile program?] Some customers have long-standing military ties with Pyongyang, while others have sought to take advantage of the unique market niche created by North Korea: a kind of global eBay for vintage and refurbished Cold War-era weapons, often at prices far lower than the prevailing rates. North Korean soldiers carrying packs marked with a radioactive symbol take part in a 2013 military parade in Pyongyang. North Korea has been selling small arms around the world to bring in the hard currency it needs to survive. (Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images) Over time, the small-arms trade has emerged as a reliable source of cash for a regime with considerable expertise in the tactics of running contraband, including the use of “false flag” shipping and the clever concealment of illegal cargo in bulk shipments of legitimate goods such as sugar or — as in the case of the Jie Shun — a giant mound of loose iron ore. “These cover materials not only act to obfuscate shipments, but really highlights the way that licit North Korean businesses are being used to facilitate North Korean illicit activity,” said David Thompson, a senior analyst and investigator of North Korean financial schemes for the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington. “It is this nesting which makes this illicit activity so hard to identify.” With North Korea’s other profitable enterprises being hurt by international sanctions, Thompson said, such exports are now “likely more important than ever.” Beneath yellow rocks Even by North Korean standards, the Jie Shun was a veritable rust bucket. The freighter’s steel frame was corroded from bow to stern, and its fixtures caked with coal dust from previous voyages, U.N. investigators would later report. The desalination system had stopped working, judging from crates of water bottles officials would find strewn around the crew compartments. Whether its weapons were discovered or not, the ship’s 8,000-mile voyage last summer was probably destined to be its last. “The ship was in terrible shape,” said a Western diplomat familiar with confidential reports from the official U.N. inquest. “This was a one-shot voyage, and the boat was probably intended for the scrap yard afterward.” [Photos of the Jie Shun show how rocket-propelled grenades were concealed under iron ore] Seaworthy or not, the ship set sail from the port city of Haeju, North Korea, on July 23, 2016, with a 23-member North Korean crew that included a captain and a political officer to ensure Communist Party discipline on board. Although North Korean-owned, the vessel had been registered in Cambodia, allowing it to fly a Cambodian flag and claim Phnom Penh as its home port. Using a “flag of convenience,” as the tactic is called, allows North Korean ships to avoid drawing unwanted attention in international waters. So does the practice of routinely shutting off a vessel’s transponder, behavior documented in a February U.N. report that described the Jie Shun’s voyage. “The vessel’s automatic identification system was off for the majority of the voyage,” the report said, “except in busy sea lanes where such behavior could be noticed and assessed as a safety threat.” Still, a 300-foot-long freighter big enough to hold 2,400 passenger cars is not easily concealed. U.S. intelligence agencies tracked the ship as it left North Korea, and then monitored it as it steamed around the Malay Peninsula and sailed westward across the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The vessel was heading northward through the Red Sea in early August when the warning was passed to Egyptian authorities about a suspicious North Korean vessel that appeared bound for the Suez Canal. “They were notified by our side,” said a former senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the events. “I give their foreign ministry credit for taking it seriously.” The Jie Shun had not yet reached the canal when an Egyptian naval vessel ordered the crew to halt for an inspection. At first, the cargo hold appeared to match the description on the manifest: 2,300 tons of loose yellow rocks called limonite, a kind of iron ore. But digging beneath stone and tarp, the inspectors found wooden crates — stacks of them. Asked about the boxes, the crew produced a bill of lading listing the contents, in awkward English, as “assembly parts of the underwater pump.” But after the last of the 79 crates was unloaded and opened at Egypt’s al-Adabiyah port, it was clear that this was a weapons shipment like none other: more than 24,000 rocket-propelled grenades, and completed components for 6,000 more. All were North Korean copies of a rocket warhead known as the PG-7, a variant of a Soviet munition first built in the 1960s. [North Korea defies predictions — again — with early grasp of weapons milestone] A closer examination by U.N. experts would reveal yet another deception, this one apparently intended to fool the weapons’ Egyptian recipients: Each of the rockets bore a stamp with a manufacturing date of March 2016, just a few months before the Jie Shun sailed. But the label, like the manifest, was false. “On-site analysis revealed that they were not of recent production,” the U.N. report said, “but rather had been stockpiled for some time.” A worldwide customer base North Korea’s booming illicit arms trade is an outgrowth of a legitimate business that began decades ago. In the 1960s and ’70s, the Soviet Union gave away conventional weapons — and, in some cases, entire factories for producing them — to developing countries as a way of winning allies and creating markets for Soviet military technology. Many of these client states would standardize the use of communist-bloc munitions and weapons systems in their armies, thus ensuring a steady demand for replacement parts and ammunition that would continue well into the future. Sensing an opportunity, North Korea obtained licenses to manufacture replicas of Soviet and Chinese weapons, ranging from assault rifles and artillery rockets to naval frigates and battle tanks. Arms factories sprouted in the 1960s that soon produced enough weapons to supply North Korea’s vast military, as well as a surplus that could be sold for cash. [How Russia quietly undercuts sanctions intended to stop North Korea’s nuclear program] By the end of the Cold War, North Korea’s customer base spanned four continents and included dozens of countries, as well as armed insurgencies. The demand for discount North Korean weapons would continue long after the Soviet Union collapsed, and even after North Korea came under international censure and economic isolation because of its nuclear weapons program, said Andrea Berger, a North Korea specialist and senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif. “North Korea’s assistance created a legacy of dependency,” said Berger, author of “Target Markets,” a 2015 monograph on the history of Pyongyang’s arms exports. “The type of weaponry that these [client] countries still have in service is largely based on communist-bloc designs from the Cold War era. North Korea has started to innovate and move beyond those designs, but it is still willing to provide spare parts and maintenance. As the Russians and Chinese have moved away from this market, the North Koreans have stuck around.” As a succession of harsh U.N. sanctions threatened to chase away customers, North Korea simply changed tactics. Ships that ferried artillery rockets and tank parts to distant ports changed their names and registry papers so they could sail under a foreign flag. New front companies sprang up in China and Malaysia to handle transactions free of any visible connection to Pyongyang. A mysterious online weapons vendor called Glocom — jokingly dubbed the “Samsung of North Korean proliferators” by some Western investigators — began posting slick videos hawking a variety of wares ranging from military radios to guidance systems for drones, never mentioning North Korea as the source. The sanctions stigma inevitably scared away some potential buyers, but the trading in the shadows remains brisk, intelligence officials and Western diplomats say. Some remaining clients are fellow pariah states such as Syria, whose recent purchases have included chemical-weapons protective gear. Other long-term customers are nonstate actors such as the militant group Hezbollah, which has acquired North Korean rockets and missiles from arms smugglers and sympathetic regimes. North Korean-made rifles have even been recovered from the bodies of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, although U.S. officials believe the guns were probably looted from stocks sold to the late Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi years earlier. Still other customers look to North Korea as one of the last suppliers of low-cost parts and ammunition for older weapons systems that are scarcely found in commercial markets. The list includes sub-Saharan African countries such as Uganda and Congo, which for decades relied on North Korea to train and equip their armies. The list also includes Egypt, a major U.S. aid recipient that still maintains diplomatic ties and has a history of military-to-military ties dating back to the 1970s with Pyongyang, said Berger, the Middlebury researcher. Although Cairo has publicly sworn off dealing with North Korea, she said, incidents such as the Jie Shun show how hard it is to break old habits, especially for military managers seeking to extend the life of costly weapons systems. Egypt’s army today still has dozens of weapons systems that were originally of Soviet design. Among them are at least six types of antitank weapons, including the RPG-7, the 1960s-era grenade-launcher that uses the same PG-7 warhead as those discovered on the Jie Shun. The number of Egyptian RPG-7 tubes in active service has been estimated at nearly 180,000. “Egypt was a consistent North Korean customer in the past,” Berger said. “I would call them a ‘resilient’ customer today.” Diplomatic turbulence When Egyptian officials were first confronted about their country’s possible ties to the Jie Shun’s rockets, the response was denial, followed by obfuscation, Western diplomats said. At the time of the discovery, Egypt was a newly elected nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council, and its delegation resisted including information in official reports linking Egyptian officials or businesses to illicit North Korean weapons, said U.S. officials and diplomats familiar with the discussions. The embassy statement said Egyptian officials sought only minor delays to ensure that their views on the events were properly reflected. It noted that Security Council officials had “recognized and praised Egypt’s role” in assisting the investigation. In any case, the February U.N. report on the incident sidesteps the question of who was meant to receive the rockets, saying only that the munitions were destroyed by Egypt under U.N. supervision, and that “the destination and end user of the equipment was investigated by the Egyptian general prosecutor.” But evidence gathered by U.N. investigators and later shared with diplomats left little doubt about where the rockets were bound. An early clue was the nature of the rockets themselves: All were practice rounds — fitted with removable, nonlethal warheads of the type used in military training — and the large quantity suggested that the purchaser had a sizable army with many thousands of recruits. Egypt’s active-duty military is 438,000 strong, with another 479,000 reservists. The most damning evidence was discovered on the crates. Each had been stenciled with the name of an Egyptian company, but someone had taken trouble of covering the lettering with a canvas patch. Diplomats familiar with the investigation confirmed the involvement of the Egyptian company, but declined to name it. Likewise, the Egyptian company is identified nowhere in the U.N. report. A single footnote states, cryptically: “National authorities closed the private company and revoked its license.” While U.S. officials have declined to publicly criticize Egypt, the Jie Shun incident — coming on top of other reported weapons deals with North Korea in recent years — contributed to the diplomatic turbulence that defined relations between Cairo and the Obama and Trump administrations. U.S. officials confirmed that the rockets were among the factors leading to the Trump administration’s decision in July to freeze or delay 290 million in military aid to Egypt. During Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi’s visit to Washington that month, President Trump praised the military strongman before TV cameras for “doing a fantastic job.” But a White House statement released afterward made clear that a warning had been delivered in private. “President Trump stressed the need for all countries to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea,” said the official statement, including the need to “stop providing economic or military benefits to North Korea.” Read more: How North Koreans are escaping the clutches of Kim Jong Un North Korea’s surprising, lucrative relationship with Africa China watches in frustration as North Korea crisis enters dangerous spiral ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"North Korea has been supplying Egypt with weapons and equipment despite the tightening of economic sanctions, according to US officials and Western diplomats.

Misnomers often arise because the thing received its name long before its true nature was known, or because the nature of an earlier form is no longer the norm. A misnomer may also be simply a word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. \\"Misnomer\\" does not mean \\"misunderstanding\\" or \\"popular misconception\\", and many misnomers remain in legitimate use (that is, being a misnomer does not always make a name incorrect). - Hotch Potchi is a Japanese boy band group . The band was formed in 2005 . Many of the original members quit , including lead singer Yousuke . They were replaced by new members . - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers. - The Monkees are an American-British pop rock band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series \\"The Monkees\\", which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner. - A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? wishing a had a new car already Options: - negative. - positive.","completion":"In order to accurately describe the sentiment of the given tweet, one must take into account the tone and context of the message. The tweet states, \\"wishing a had a new car already.\\" This expression can be read in several ways, each of which may convey a distinct sentiment. Firstly, focusing on the feeling of desire for a new car, one could argue that the tweet has a positive sentiment. The individual expresses an aspiration, which implies they might be in a phase of life where they are looking forward to or actively pursuing this goal. This outlook reflects a sense of optimism and hope for the future. However, by honing in on the word \\"already,\\" it is also possible to frame the tweet as having a negative sentiment. This specific word choice implies a level of impatience or frustration, suggesting that the individual is unhappy with their current situation. They might be experiencing dissatisfaction with their current car, or perhaps facing difficulties in acquiring a new vehicle. In this sense, the tweet conveys a more negative tone. Taking both of these perspectives into consideration, it is important to recognize that the sentiment of a tweet or statement is not always straightforward, and can encompass multiple layers of meaning. It can be particularly challenging to discern the intended sentiment in a brief tweet with limited context. Given this understanding, a comprehensive classification of the tweet's sentiment would likely encompass elements of both positive (desire for a new car) and negative (impatience or frustration) emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the differences between a borderline personality disorder and a narcissistic personality? What are similarities between borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. While they both deal with the comparison of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), they approach the subject from different angles. The first question asks for the differences between the two disorders, while the second question seeks to understand their similarities. Differences between Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 1. Emotion Regulation: BPD is characterized by intense emotional instability, fear of abandonment, sudden mood swings, and outbursts of anger. Individuals with BPD often experience chronic feelings of emptiness and are prone to self-harm or suicidal thoughts. NPD, on the other hand, involves feelings of grandiosity, exaggerated self-importance, and a constant need for admiration. They may exhibit limited empathy and are often insensitive to the needs of others. 2. Relationships: People with BPD often experience unstable and tumultuous relationships, as they struggle to maintain close connections while fearing abandonment. They may have intense and fluctuating emotions, making it difficult for them to form consistent and trusting relationships. On the contrary, those with NPD can be controlling and manipulative in relationships. They frequently lack empathy and understanding, seeing others as mere extensions of themselves or as instruments to achieve their goals. 3. Self-Image: Individuals with BPD often struggle with identity issues and have an unstable self-image. They may adjust their values and beliefs according to their environment or the people they interact with in an effort to fit in. Conversely, individuals with NPD possess an inflated sense of self-worth, feeling superior to others, and believing they deserve special treatment. 4. Handling Criticism: People with BPD are usually sensitive to criticism and can react with intense anger or self-destructive behavior when they perceive rejection. In contrast, those with NPD often respond to criticism with disdain or by outright dismissing remarks, as they are unable to tolerate any perceived threat to their self-image. Similarities between Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 1. Both are classified as Cluster B personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This classification includes disorders characterized by dramatic, emotional, or erratic behavior, making it difficult for individuals to form healthy, functioning relationships. 2. Both disorders involve problems with emotional regulation, self-image, interpersonal relationships, and empathy. For instance, those with BPD or NPD may have difficulty bonding with others, understanding other people's feelings, or maintaining stable relationships. 3. Early childhood experiences and attachment issues may contribute to the development of both BPD and NPD. People with either disorder may struggle with unresolved traumas or unmet emotional needs, which can manifest in their adult lives as relationship issues or emotional difficulties. 4. Treatment options for both BPD and NPD involve various forms of psychotherapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or psychodynamic therapy. The treatment process can be lengthy and challenging for both individuals and their therapists, as the disorders feature ingrained patterns of thought and behavior that require time and effort to modify. In summary, although the two questions posed explore the relationship between BPD and NPD, they address different aspects of the disorders. The first question seeks to understand the differences between them, while the second question aims to discover their similarities. Understanding both the differences and similarities can provide valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with these disorders and inform effective treatment strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay. The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year. Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month. The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women. Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper. The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000. He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit.

Article: For many children of traditional parents, marrying is only an option the parents will consider once the child's college or career education is complete, and a steady (and respectable) job has been held by the child for at least 1-2 years. Approaching them with the idea of marriage before you graduate can understandably feel like you're endangering their hard work. Waiting, in that case, is best. Belittling them, comparing your behavior to theirs, and otherwise insulting them will not change their mind and is not your role as a respectful and loving child. First, ask your parents how they feel, what they like, what they don't like in the current situation, and what they expect you to do. Be silent until they finish explaining what they think about the situation. “I'd like to hear what you think about all this.” Once they finish explaining, they will definitely ask some questions to you (and the girl, if she is present in the room) in terms of how to approach this whole thing, finances, your future, and other general topics—all of which you should try to answer. The temptation to avoid answering their questions might be strong, especially if you find you have not thought through an issue they raise or if you do not yet have an answer you like. You can always return to the conversation, but try to answer fully and be honest about where you struggle with their questions. If their explanation presents another situation that gives a feasible solution for everyone, then take it up. Don't keep your feelings or relationship a secret.

Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

Refraction of light is similar to refraction of sound waves. You can also read more about refraction of light in the lesson “Optics. ”. Choices: - vibration - reflection - resonance - refraction A: Answer:","completion":"Refraction When light bends as it passes from one type of matter to another, the phenomenon that occurs is called refraction. When light travels through different media with different refractive indices, the speed at which it travels changes, causing the light to change direction and bend. This is similar to the refraction of sound waves, which also involves the change in speed and direction of waves as they pass through different media. In the provided paragraph, the text explains that light may be refracted by matter, and this bending of light occurs when it passes from one type of matter to another. It also mentions that refraction of light is similar to refraction of sound waves and could be further studied in the lesson on \\"Optics.\\" From the given choices - vibration, reflection, resonance, and refraction - the correct option that accurately describes the phenomenon of light bending as it passes from one type of matter to another in the context of the paragraph is refraction.

Options: - boiling water - pacific ocean - cold water - a huge knife - fish market The answer is \\"boiling water\\" because Answer:","completion":"The crab was startled when it saw something in the kitchen, and the answer is \\"boiling water\\" because this represents the most immediate and significant source of danger to the crab. Boiling water is often used in the process of cooking crabs, making it the most relevant and threatening variable for the crab among the other options provided. Option one, the Pacific Ocean, does not make sense in the context, as oceans are typically not found inside kitchens. Moreover, the Pacific Ocean, being the crab's natural habitat, would not likely startle or alarm the crab. In fact, the crab might feel more at ease if it were near the ocean. Option two, cold water, while it may be a minor inconvenience for the crab, is not as threatening as boiling water, which would lead to the crab's immediate demise. Cold water may slow down the crab's metabolism, but it does not pose a direct or significant danger to its survival. Option three, a huge knife, might startle the crab, but it is important to consider that, as a crustacean, the crab may not have the cognitive ability to perceive or understand the threat posed by a knife in the same way that humans do. While a knife may be dangerous for the crab in the hands of a human, it would not be a direct cause of harm without human intervention. Option four, fish market, is a place where crabs and other seafood are sold. However, being in a kitchen, a fish market does not fit within the context of the scene. Furthermore, a crab might not be able to comprehend the meaning or purpose of a fish market, and therefore, would likely not find it startling or alarming. In conclusion, the answer is \\"boiling water\\" because of its direct threat to the crab's life and its relevance in the context of a kitchen environment. Boiling water is commonly used to cook crabs, making it the most probable source of alarm among the options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mike preferred eating fresh fruit in the morning instead of oatmeal because the","completion":"Mike preferred eating fresh fruit in the morning instead of oatmeal because the vibrant flavors and natural juiciness of the fruit provided him with a more pleasurable and invigorating start to his day, activating all of his senses and nourishing his body with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that maintained optimal health and well-being. There are several reasons why Mike might opt for fresh fruit over oatmeal as his morning meal of choice, including taste preferences, nutritional benefits, and how it affects his overall energy levels throughout the day. Firstly, fresh fruit boasts an assortment of flavors that range from sweet, tangy, to mildly sour, depending on the type of fruit being consumed. This rich diversity appeals not only to Mike's taste buds but also keeps him engaged and excited for breakfast each day. In contrast, oatmeal has a rather neutral and sometimes bland taste that might require additional sweeteners, flavors, or toppings to make it more palatable, which can sometimes lead to the consumption of excess sugars or fats. In terms of nutritional benefits, fresh fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins, such as vitamin C, which is crucial for supporting the immune system, and vitamin A, which plays a vital role in maintaining healthy skin, vision, and overall growth and development. Additionally, fruits are rich in minerals like potassium, which is necessary for regulating blood pressure, and magnesium, which aids in muscle and nerve function. Moreover, fresh fruits are packed with antioxidants, including flavonoids, polyphenols, and anthocyanins, that help protect the body from free radicals and oxidative stress, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Oatmeal also contains beneficial nutrients, such as heart-healthy soluble fiber, B vitamins, iron, and zinc. However, for individuals like Mike, the combination of taste preferences and the nutrient composition of fresh fruit might simply be more appealing for their palates and health goals. Another factor that could influence Mike's choice of fresh fruit over oatmeal is the effect each food has on his energy levels, digestion, and satiety. Fresh fruits, being rich in natural sugars and rapidly digestible carbohydrates, could give Mike quick bursts of energy and help wake up his metabolism, whereas oatmeal, containing complex carbohydrates and proteins, might provide a slower and more sustained release of energy. Depending on Mike's lifestyle and activity levels, he might find that the quicker energy supply from fresh fruits better suits his needs, especially during the early hours of the day. Lastly, for some individuals, the texture and mouthfeel of food play a significant role in their food choices. The soft and juicy textures of fresh fruits can be more enticing and refreshing, while oatmeal has a thicker, denser consistency that some people might find less appealing. Thus, Mike preferred eating fresh fruit in the morning instead of oatmeal because the experience of savoring the diverse range of flavors, availing of the numerous health benefits, and enjoying the natural energy boost and appealing textures provided him with a holistic and satisfying breakfast ritual that left him feeling invigorated and ready to conquer the day ahead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kim Yo Jong's inclusion in the North Korean delegation is likely to irritate the United States, which has sent its own delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence to counter North Korea's charm offensive. Last year, the US Treasury Department included Kim Yo Jong on its list of blacklisted officials .

The Vice President's delegation includes the father of the late Otto Warmbier, an American student who died shortly after being released from North Korean custody. Fred Warmbier and his wife Cindy were in the audience during US President Donald Trump's State of the Union address last month. They looked on tearfully as the President cited their son's treatment as a example of the \\"menace that threatens our world.\\" The US delegation will be joined by the President's daughter and senior advisor Ivanka Trump , who will attend the closing ceremony on February 25, a White House official said Monday.

Kim Yo-jong, a senior Workers' Party official promoted to the politburo last year, will be the first immediate Kim family member to cross the border. Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony. The North's participation has been seen as a thawing of bilateral ties. However, the US, Japan and others have accused the North of using the Games for propaganda purposes. Who is Kim Yo-jong? Believed to have been born in 1987, she is the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il and is Kim Jong-un's full sister. She is about four years younger than her brother and is said to be very close to him. She is reportedly married to the son of Choe Ryong-hae, the powerful party secretary. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kim Yo-jong at the opening of a residential complex in Pyongyang in 2017 Kim Yo-jong has been in the spotlight sporadically in recent years, with her main job being to protect her brother's image via her role in the party's propaganda department. She remains blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. A message from her brother? Analysis: BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul This is a huge surprise. There had been speculation Kim Yo-jong might be part of the delegation but few thought it would actually happen. It is being seen as a sign that Kim Jong-un is serious about improving ties with South Korea. Kim Yo-jong is one of Kim Jong-un's closest aides and some are speculating that she might be bringing a message from her brother. But there could be a number of obstacles to overcome if she is to make it to Pyeongchang. She is targeted by US sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, although she is not on the UN Security Council travel blacklist. There is also the question of how she will get to the Games. Seoul has had to request special permission from the US and others in the international community to allow North Korean athletes and performers to travel south by bus and ferry. They may have to do so again and this time it will be for a member of Kim Jong-un's own family. How rare is this visit? It would be the first by a direct member of the Kim dynasty. Chang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un's uncle and brother in law of Kim Jong-il, did travel to the South but did not belong to the Baekdu blood line, which is considered significant. There is speculation in the South that this is part of Kim Yo-jong's grooming for greater power, and that she could be bringing a letter from her brother to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who she is likely to meet. It is unclear whether Kim Yo-jong will be at the opening ceremony on Friday. Who else is in the delegation? Politically, four figures, including Kim Yo-jong, are key. The others are: Kim Yong-nam . North Korea's ceremonial head of state, the president of its parliament. The diplomatically sure-footed 90-year-old has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders and has travelled overseas before .

It's a 280-strong delegation, most of whom arrived in the South on Wednesday.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North Korean cheerleaders arrive in the South for the Games The team arrived via a western border at 09:28 local time (00:26 GMT), the Yonhap news agency reported. Only 10 athletes will compete for the North at the Games, along with another 12 as part of a unified Korean women's ice hockey team. Drip, drip, drip of PR Michael Madden, North Korea leadership expert In announcing its delegates both to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the inter-Korean culture events on the sidelines, Pyongyang let out the information in a slow drip. Part of this is Pyongyang maximising the positive PR effects. The announcement of the full delegation came following the arrival of its athletes to the Games late last week, and one day after 10 musicians arrived in South Korea. So now North Korea has earned itself a third day of positive media coverage about its participation in the Olympics. How have others reacted? The US is scornful of the North's motives over the Olympics and is sending Vice-President Mike Pence to the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang to counter what it terms propaganda. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Both the US and Japan have been critical of the North's Olympics policy \\"We're travelling to the Olympics to make sure that North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the Winter Olympics to paper over the truth about their regime,\\" he said. He was in Tokyo on Wednesday and maintained the pressure, announcing that \\"the United States will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea\\". Japan has been equally sceptical. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: \\"We must not be fooled by North Korea's 'smile diplomacy'.\\" Where are we on North-South ties? North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a new series of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, and a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump. Kim Jong-un then extended a New Year's olive branch to the South over participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February. The perceived warming of ties has not been without difficulties, not least the North's decision to move a military parade in Pyongyang from April to the day before the opening of the Games. ||||| FILE - This 2015, file photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong, left, during their visit to a military unit in North Korea.

(Associated Press) FILE - This 2015, file photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong, left, during their visit to a military unit in North Korea. South... (Associated Press) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, an increasingly prominent figure in the country's leadership, will be part of the North's delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics, officials said Wednesday. Kim Yo Jong, believed to be around 30, will be the first member of North Korea's ruling family to visit South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Analysts say her inclusion in the Olympic delegation shows North Korea's ambition to use the Olympics to break out from diplomatic isolation by improving relations with the South, which it could use as a bridge for approaching the United States. By sending a youthful, photogenic person who will undoubtedly attract international attention during the Olympics, North Korea is also trying to construct a fresher and warmer public image and defuse potential U.S. efforts to use the Pyeongchang Games to highlight the North's brutal human rights record, experts say. Kim Jong Un might also have seen that U.S. President Donald Trump was sending his daughter, Ivanka, to the Olympics ceremony and decided to match the move by sending his sister, said Hong Min, an analyst at Seoul's Korea Institute for National Unification. By sending a relative, \\"Kim Jong Un may be trying to present himself as an equal to Donald Trump,\\" Hong said. South Korea's Unification Ministry said North Korea informed it that Kim Yo Jong, first vice director of the Central Committee of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, would be part of the delegation led by the country's nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam. The ministry said Kim Yo Jong's schedule in the South has yet to be determined, and it wasn't immediately clear whether she will meet with President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who has expressed a desire to reach out to the North. Moon's office welcomed the decision to send Kim Yo Jong, which it said showed the North's willingness to cooperate in efforts to ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula. \\"First Vice Director Kim Yo Jong is Chairman Kim Jong Un's sister who has an important role in the Workers' Party, (so her visit) is that much more meaningful,\\" presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said in a statement read on television. Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University, said Kim Yo Jong, as Kim Jong Un's relative and apparently one of the few people who has earned his absolute trust, carries more weight as a dialogue partner for the South than any other official the North could send. It's unclear whether any member of the North Korean government delegation will hold talks with U.S. officials during the Olympics. But Kim Yo Jong's presence would give North Korea a better opportunity to win South Korean help in reaching out to the United States, Hong said. He also said Washington may see Kim Yo Jong as an avenue to deliver messages to Kim Jong Un. \\"With any other North Korean official, even the so-called No. 2 Choe Ryong Hae, you are getting a person who's just parroting orders given by Kim Jong Un,\\" Hong said. \\"But with Kim Yo Jong, you are getting a person who's chiefly involved in designing Kim Jong Un's rule, a person whom the leader actually listens to.\\" North Korea said the delegation will also include Choe Hwi, chairman of the country's National Sports Guidance Committee, and Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North's agency that deals with inter-Korean affairs. Seoul previously said the delegation would arrive Friday, but Wednesday's statement was the first confirmation that a member of the North's ruling family will be included. Kim Yo Jong and Kim Jong Un were born to the same mother, Ko Yong Hui. They had a half brother, Kim Jong Nam, who was murdered last year at a Malaysian airport. Kim Yo Jong was promoted by her brother last year to be an alternate member of the decision-making political bureau of the ruling party's central committee, which analysts said showed that her activities are more substantive than previously thought. The war-separated Koreas are cooperating on a series of conciliatory measures during the Olympics, which the South sees as an opportunity to ease tensions with the North following an extended period of animosity over its nuclear weapon and missile programs. Skeptics think North Korea is trying to use the Olympics to weaken U.S.-led sanctions and pressure against it and buy time to advance its weapons programs. North Korea has 22 athletes competing in the Winter Olympics but also has sent performing artists and a large cheering group. A decision by North Korea to send the artists by sea has triggered debate in the South, where conservatives see the move as a clear indication the North is trying to use the Olympics to ease sanctions against it. South Korea is deciding whether to accept North Korea's request that it provide fuel for the ferry that transported the artists. Seoul exempted the ferry from sanctions to allow it in South Korean waters. \\"We will closely discuss with the United States and other related nations the matter of providing convenience to the Mangyongbong ferry so that no problem regarding sanctions would occur,\\" said Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman, Baik Tae-hyun. |||||Summary:","completion":"Kim Yo-Jong, the younger sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, is set to attend the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea. As part of a North Korean delegation, her inclusion could provoke an irritated response from the US, whose delegation is headed up by vice-president Mike Pence.

Steven always calculate the risks before they invest but Benjamin doesn't as","completion":"he relies on his instinct and intuition. These two friends, each with their own investment philosophy, had known each other since they were kids. They grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same school, and even attended the same college, majoring in finance. Everything was fine until one day, they decided to start a small hedge fund together. Their partnership was natural and seemed promising, blending technical analysis and gut-driven instincts. They believed it would be the perfect combination to yield strong returns. Yet, they never could have anticipated the series of events that would unfold in the years to come. Their business grew successfully for a few years, outperforming the market averages and catching the attention of affluent investors. As the fund amassed more capital, the difference in their investment styles began to strain the partnership. Steven strictly adhered to quantitative analysis, crunching numbers and meticulously identifying opportunities with statistical support. Benjamin, on the other hand, relied on his innate ability to read people, market sentiment, and focus on innovative companies with tremendous growth potential. It was 2006, and Benjamin had his eyes set on a new tech startup with a revolutionary idea to change the way people communicate. The company was in its infancy and seemed promising, despite the inherent risks. However, when he suggested allocating a significant portion of the fund's assets to invest in the company, Steven resisted. Steven's calculations indicated that the company's financials didn't support its lofty projections, and the risk was too great for the fund. After heated debates and sleepless nights, they compromised. Benjamin would take a small percentage of the fund to invest in the startup, but only after both agreed to diversify the portfolio into several other ventures. They shook hands, confident that their differing approaches would secure the fund's future. Benjamin's startup investment began to take off, and by 2008, it turned into a seismic disruptor in the tech industry. The company was none other than Facebook. The tremendous success of their early investment sent the hedge fund's worth skyrocketing. What was initially thought to be an unfortunate compromise between the two friends became their crowning achievement. Despite the success, the financial unrest of the 2008 market crash was looming on the horizon. The economy was shaking, and tensions between Steven and Benjamin grew. Steven, true to his analytical roots, began focusing on safe investments, choosing conservative plays that would buffer against the potential collapse. Benjamin, emboldened by his previous success, insisted on betting big on new, innovative companies - ones equally as risky as Facebook had been. When the market crash eventually struck, the rift between them intensified. Though they managed to survive through the prudent diversification Steven had insisted upon, Benjamin's high-risk investments faltered. Steven, disappointed in his friend's inability to acknowledge the risk, decided it was time to part ways professionally. The hedge fund, once a testament to the power of combined wisdom, would be no more. The two friends agreed to dissolve it and split the remaining assets. They each started their respective ventures, with Steven founding a new fund based on data-driven investment strategies and Benjamin creating a venture capital firm that continued to focus on risky, avant-garde companies. As the years passed, their paths rarely crossed. Their once-strong friendship was reduced to a series of curt emails, discussing what was left of their joint investments. Both went on to achieve individual success. Steven's fund thrived in a world that increasingly valued the power of data and analytics, while Benjamin's venture capital firm discovered several successful startups, making him a renowned name in the industry. Despite their diverging paths, they would always remember their humble beginnings and how they complemented each other perfectly in those early years. It was only in the twilight of their careers that Steven and Benjamin met again for one final time. They shared old memories and acknowledged the role each played in molding the other's life and career. As they bid each other farewell, they couldn't help but wonder how their future would have unfolded if they had found a way to nurture their contrasting styles. But life had its way of teaching lessons, and this was one of them. The story of Steven and Benjamin would be passed down to future generations as a parable of how the marriage of two contrasting investment philosophies could lead to great success if nurtured and respected, and the importance of friendship over ego."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By conducting this test, the aim was primarily to evaluate the relationship between PM (particulate matter) and mortality. Sensitivity tests are valuable tools in research because they identify variations in data, specifically under different scenarios or assumptions. In this context, the test would have assessed the robustness of the dose-response relationship between PM and mortality. The sensitivity test outcomes would thus help researchers pinpoint underlying data, including probable consistencies or inconsistencies, and explore any uncertainties in the results. So, it follows that \\"The test that was conducted helped pinpoint data for the research.\\" As a result, the researchers can potentially improve the study's reliability, make better predictions, understand the overall effect of PM on mortality, and possibly inform future policy-making pertaining to air quality and public health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. Question: suppose We are in a low altitude zone happens, how will it affect less oxygen will be produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less When we are in a low-altitude zone, the atmospheric pressure is higher than at high altitudes. This means there is an increased amount of air pressure acting on our bodies, causing the air to become denser and contain more oxygen molecules per unit volume. To understand how this affects the oxygen production, let's revisit the process of breathing and gas exchange in the body. 1. Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs. When we inhale, air is pulled into the respiratory system via the nose and mouth, which filters, warms, and moistens it before it travels through the windpipe (trachea) and into the lungs. 2. The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs. Inside the lungs, the trachea further divides into two bronchi (bronchus for one lung), which subsequently branch into bronchioles. These smaller tubes spread throughout the lungs. 3. Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli. The bronchioles end in tiny grape-like air sacs called alveoli, where oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange occurs. The walls of alveoli are very thin, allowing for efficient gas exchange. 4. Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood. When the air reaches the alveoli, oxygen molecules (O2) from the air move across the thin membrane and into the bloodstream, binding to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 5. Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart. The blood with high oxygen levels (oxygen-rich blood) is then carried back to the heart via pulmonary veins. 6. Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart. The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to various tissues and organs throughout the body via arteries. 7. Cells take in the oxygen-rich blood and release carbon dioxide-rich blood. As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the body's cells, oxygen is released and taken up by the cells for use in energy production (cellular respiration), while carbon dioxide (CO2), a waste product, diffuses back into the bloodstream. 8. The carbon dioxide-rich blood travels to the lungs. The blood with high carbon dioxide levels (carbon dioxide-rich blood) returns to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. 9. Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. As we exhale, the carbon dioxide diffuses across the thin alveoli membrane, moving from the bloodstream into the alveoli, and then is expelled from the body when we breathe out. In a low-altitude zone, the higher atmospheric pressure results in the air being denser and having more oxygen molecules per unit volume. This greater concentration of oxygen allows for more effective gas exchange in the alveoli, as the gradient or difference in oxygen levels between the air in the alveoli and the oxygen-poor blood entering the pulmonary capillaries is more significant. Consequently, the body gets more oxygen with each breath, and less oxygen needs to be produced by the cells to meet the body's demand for energy at low altitudes. In conclusion, being in a low-altitude zone affects the oxygen produced by the body—more specifically, it will lead to less oxygen being produced as the body can acquire more oxygen from the denser air, making it easier to meet the demand for oxygen in various cellular processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The panel was suggested by Sir Liam Donaldson in his 2015 report which said there were too many hospitals and expertise was too thinly spread. It highlighted duplication and called for a simpler, more efficient system. Sir Liam said the panel should be international and it should be agreed in advance to accept its proposals. However, Health Minister Simon Hamilton did not agree, saying the panel should be mostly local and there would be no upfront agreement to accept its findings. The panel announced on Thursday has two international figures and four more from Northern Ireland. It will be chaired by Prof Rafael Bengoa who is director of the health department at the Deusto Business School in Spain. He is regarded as a worldwide expert on health reform and has advised the European Union and the Obama administration. Prof Bengoa previously worked for the World Health Organisation for more than 15 years. He said that over the last 40 years, there had been a focus in health on \\"planning around structures instead of planning around patient needs and outcomes\\". \\"The important thing for us at the panel is to be thinking in outcome terms and then we see if there is any physical restructuring that is needed to fulfil those outcomes but not the other way around,\\" he added. \\"The difference Northern Ireland is suggesting is that they are engaging both politically and technically on the long-term and so other countries are not doing that and that is why I think it is interesting to accept this invitation to lead the panel.\\" Other panel members include two Northern Ireland-based doctors and two health service managers who are from Northern Ireland but now work in England. They are; In a statement, Mr Hamilton said: \\"We know that health and social care is facing significant challenges in the coming years. \\"Our population is increasing in size and is getting older. More people are living with chronic conditions, unhealthy lifestyles are creating more demand for services and new developments in medical technologies and drugs are increasing demand and raising costs. \\"We cannot afford to stand still. We have to transform our health and social care system to make sure we can continue to deliver world class services. \\"I am therefore appointing an expert panel to lead the debate on the optimal configuration of health and social care services in Northern Ireland.\\" Mr Hamilton wants cross-party consensus on the specific terms of reference for the panel. This is to be discussed a a political summit on health next month. The experts will then begin the main part of their work by mid-March. It is hoped the panel will report by the summer on specific changes to Northern Ireland's health system, but any substantial proposals are likely to take years to implement.

Article: On November 10, 2007, at approximately 7:35 pm, paramedics responding to an emergency call transported West's mother, Donda West, to the nearby Centinela Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey, California. She was unresponsive in the emergency room, and after resuscitation attempts, doctors pronounced her dead at approximately 8:30 pm, at age 58. The Los Angeles County coroner's office said in January 2008 that West had died of heart disease while suffering \\"multiple post-operative factors\\" after plastic surgery. She had undergone liposuction and breast reduction. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andre Aboolian had refused to do the surgery because West had a health condition that placed her at risk for a heart attack. Aboolian referred her to an internist to investigate her cardiac issue. She never met with the doctor recommended by Aboolian and had the procedures performed by a third doctor, Jan Adams. Question: What condition along with complications for the plastic surgery caused the death of Donda West?","completion":"Donda West, who was the mother of a famous person named Kanye West, passed away because of a heart problem and some difficulties after having plastic surgery.

What are some of the best examples of hypocrisy about feminism in India? What are some of the best examples of hypocrisy in India? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"a). no; The two questions are not the same. The first question specifically refers to the examples of hypocrisy about feminism in India, while the second question is more general, asking about the examples of hypocrisy in India without specifying a particular context. Here are some detailed answers to both questions: 1. Examples of hypocrisy about feminism in India: a. Traditional gender roles: While advocating for women's rights and equality, many people in India still conform to traditional gender roles in their own lives. For example, a person might outwardly support women's right to work, but still expect women in their family to prioritize housework and childcare. b. Pay gap: Despite the persistent fight for equal pay, the gender pay gap is still a significant issue in India. Many companies and organizations may claim to support feminism and gender equality while continuing to pay female employees less than their male counterparts. c. Victim blaming: In cases of sexual assault and harassment, it is common to see discussions that shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim. This is in direct contradiction to the feminist ideal of holding aggressors accountable for their actions. d. Selective support: Some people may claim to be feminist but only support certain aspects of the ideology that align with their personal beliefs or interests. This can be seen in cases where someone supports women in certain professions but does not advocate for the rights of women from different social backgrounds or marginalized communities. 2. Examples of general hypocrisy in India: a. Caste system: Though the Indian constitution abolished caste-based discrimination, it still persists in many parts of the society. People may claim to be against caste discrimination while participating in caste-based practices in their personal lives, such as marrying within their own caste or supporting caste-based reservations in education and jobs. b. Political corruption: Many politicians in India criticize corruption but may themselves be involved in corrupt practices, such as taking bribes, misusing public funds, or engaging in nepotism. c. Religious intolerance: India is a secular country, but instances of religious intolerance are prevalent. People from different religious backgrounds may preach peace and tolerance, yet involve themselves in communal violence or discriminate against individuals based on their religion. d. Environmental concerns: Many people in India express concerns about pollution and the environment yet continue to engage in environmentally harmful behaviors, such as littering, burning garbage, or using excessive plastic. In summary, the two questions are not the same, as one focuses on hypocrisy within the context of feminism in India, and the other encompasses a broader scope of hypocrisy in India in general. Although there may be some overlap in the issues mentioned, each question calls for a distinct set of examples and contexts."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: Given the below context: Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother. Guess a valid title for it!

But the regional Catalan government said there could be further arrests. A key suspect linked to the Barcelona attack and a later one is still sought. Thursday's attack in the Catalan capital saw a van driven at high speed along Las Ramblas where it smashed into dozens of people walking along the pedestrianised avenue popular with tourists and residents alike. Spanish police are searching for Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who they suspect may be the driver who escaped the scene on foot. Only hours later, early on Friday, there was a second van attack in Cambrils, west of Barcelona. A woman was killed and police shot dead five suspected attackers, including Moussa Oukabir, 17, originally reported as the key suspect in the Barcelona attack. Oukabir is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van used in Barcelona and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. The terror cell is reported to comprise 12 men. The Catalan Interior Minster, Joaquim Forn, stressed that the police operation could not be considered over until all those suspected of being part of the cell were in custody. Police say the suspects had been planning more sophisticated attacks, but an explosion on Wednesday at a house in the town of Alcanar deprived them of bomb material, so they carried out simpler attacks using vehicles. Police have found the remains of at least three people at the Alcanar house, El Pais newspaper reports. Abouyaaqoub lived in the town of Ripoll to the north of Barcelona. Three people have been arrested in Ripoll, and one in Alcanar. In Ripoll the apartment of an imam was raided on Saturday. Another van, a Renault Kangoo, is also being sought, amid reports it may have been driven across the border into France. Security is being stepped up, though the security alert level is staying unchanged as there is no information suggesting an imminent attack. Special police controls were introduced at Saturday's two La Liga football matches in Barcelona and Girona. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas attack, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it. Five of the dead have been named so far: A 74-year-old Portuguese woman, a 40-year-old woman with dual Argentine and Spanish citizenship, and a Belgian were also killed, their governments said. The whereabouts of seven-year-old Julian Cadman, a dual British-Australian national apparently separated from his injured mother during the attack, remains unclear. He was widely reported to be missing. However, the Catalan police, responding to inquiries, tweeted that they had neither been looking for nor found any missing child. The victims and the injured had all been located, they said. Catalan emergency services gave a new breakdown of the injured on Saturday: More on the victims Pegged on strings between the lamp-posts and plane trees on the packed boulevard, more and more sheets of white paper flap in the breeze.

The story of the Carricks of Whitehaven layers tragedy upon tragedy: Passengers on the Irish ship were trying to escape the potato famine that was killing their countrymen, only to see their ship go down in a storm while en route to Quebec City. Of the nearly 200 people on the Carricks, at least 80 are believed to have died off the Gaspe coast. Parks Canada archaeologist Martin Perron says the remains, which look to belong to five adults and three kids, appear to have been quickly deposited in what the Canadian Press calls a \\"shallow trench\\"—and could potentially be a mass grave. Bones have been found in the same area before.

The Carricks of Whitehaven, an Irish vessel, had been carrying nearly 200 passengers fleeing the devastating potato famine. Sadly, a storm caused the ship to sink while en route to Quebec City, and it is believed that at least 80 people perished off the Gaspe coast in the disaster. Last month, Parks Canada archaeologist Martin Perron and his team found the remains, which appear to belong to five adults and three children. The Canadian Press reported that the remains were deposited quickly in a shallow trench. This suggests the location might be a mass grave, as bones have been found in the area before. The Globe and Mail recounted the initial May 2011 find, mentioning historical accounts that described victims being laid out on the beach before burial. However, no specific location of the grave was reported in these accounts.

Following this conclusion, Parks Canada will be using ground-penetrating radar in a search for additional remains. The tragic story of the Carricks of Whitehaven highlights the desperation of those seeking refuge from the deadly potato famine in Ireland.

I tried to pour the water into the bottle, but I couldn't do it because the","completion":"stream of water from the faucet was too wide, and it ended up splashing all over the countertop. Step 1: Assess the situation and identify the problem. I observed that the faucet's water flow was too strong, which was causing the water to splash instead of filling the bottle smoothly. The first step was to analyze the issue to find an efficient solution. Step 2: Reduce the water flow. To solve the problem, I decided to adjust the faucet handle, decreasing the water flow. By carefully turning the handle, I was able to find an appropriate flow rate to minimize splashing and fill up the water bottle without any unnecessary spillage. Step 3: Search for additional tools to assist. In case the reduced flow didn't solve the issue completely, I checked around the kitchen for a funnel or other tool that could help with guiding the water into the bottle more accurately. After finding a small funnel in one of the drawers, I kept it handy by placing it beside me near the sink. Step 4: Position the water bottle and funnel. To improve efficiency, I placed the funnel on the opening of the water bottle to make sure it was stable and secure. This would enhance the process by preventing the water from splashing out and by directing the flow straight into the bottle. Step 5: Fill the water bottle. Once I had set everything up, I slowly turned on the faucet and poured the water through the funnel into the water bottle. Thanks to the funnel and the reduced water flow, the water was now conveniently channeled into the bottle without any spillage. Step 6: Clean up any remaining water. Despite the improvements made to this process, some water had already splashed onto the countertop. I grabbed a kitchen towel and wiped up any remaining water to ensure the area was clean and dry, preventing any potential slipping hazards. Step 7: Put away the funnel and store the water bottle. After successfully filling up the water bottle, I removed the funnel and rinsed it off before putting it away in its designated spot. I then closed the lid on the water bottle and placed it back in the refrigerator for future use. By following these steps, I was able to overcome the initial issue of the water splashing everywhere and create a more efficient process for filling up the water bottle.

Sleep is a necessary process that promotes proper body functioning and can improve the quality of your life. Not only is the quantity of sleep important, but also the quality of sleep. Your bedroom should be shaped to your taste and to allow you to sleep in a peaceful environment. One of the biggest mistakes people make in their sleep is to use their bedroom for activities other than sleep. If your bedroom also functions as a command station for your life and work, the likelihood of your sleeping being poor is rather high. Bedrooms should be designed, decorated and used for mainly sleep. TVs, computers and other things should not be in your bedroom if at all possible. Establishing regular sleeping and waking times can help improve the quality of your sleep especially for those suffering from sleeplessness. Avoid hot food, caffeine, sugar and alcohol at least 4 to 6 hours before your sleep time. Develop a regular exercise program. Proper exercise and nutrition will help improve sleeping patterns. However, avoid exercising 2 hours before sleeping, since this may stimulate your body and make sleeping more difficult. Establish a pre-bedtime rule that will help focus you on sleep. You can try meditation ,reading or deep breathing and relaxation. Your bedtime rule should be yours. Do not worry about it fitting into a specific category. Do what is the best for you.

The layers on the bottom level were likely laid first or last? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the layers on the bottom level of the rock layers Gerald laid down were likely laid first. This is because lower rock layers were deposited earlier, and as a result, they are assumed to contain older fossils. This principle follows the concept of superposition in geology, which states that in an undisturbed sequence of rock layers, the oldest layers are at the bottom while the youngest layers are at the top. Thus, in Gerald's case, the bottom level layers were likely laid first, giving them the chance to accumulate older fossils over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ich möchte gerne den Standpunkt der Kommission hören zur Verarbeitung von riskanten Rinderorganen zu Gelatine und Talg. Translate to English","completion":"I would like to hear the Commission's position on the processing of hazardous bovine organs into gelatine and tallow. The European Commission takes the issue of food safety very seriously, and this concern extends to the production of by-products such as gelatine and tallow from bovine organs. To address the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and other related diseases, the European Union has implemented comprehensive legislation governing the production of these substances from animal tissues. Specifically, the production of gelatine and tallow from hazardous bovine organs is strictly regulated to minimize the risk of contamination by prions, which cause BSE in cattle and its human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). European regulations aim to prevent the use of potentially contaminated animal tissues in the production of substances that may pose a risk to human or animal health. The primary legislation governing the production of these substances is Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, which lays down rules for the prevention, control, and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies like BSE. This regulation is further supported by Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, which provides rules on animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption. Regarding the production of gelatine and tallow, there are several key rules and safety measures in place: 1. Sourcing of raw materials: Only tissues from animals that have undergone required veterinary checks and have been declared fit for human consumption may be used in the production of gelatine and tallow. The use of specified risk material (SRM), which is the tissue most likely to be contaminated with prions, is prohibited for both human and animal consumption and must be removed and disposed of safely. 2. Traceability: A traceability system is in place to ensure that all animal by-products and derived products can be traced back to their origin. This allows for faster identification and removal of potentially contaminated materials from the production chain. 3. Processing methods: Both gelatine and tallow production are subject to rigorous processing methods that effectively remove or inactivate prions, minimizing the risk of contamination. The processing methods for gelatine include acid or alkaline treatment, followed by extensive rinsing, and filtration. Tallow production requires heating at high temperatures and subsequent separation of the fat from the protein material. 4. Monitoring and inspection: Authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with these regulations and carry out regular inspections of production facilities, ensuring that companies follow the required safety measures and procedures. 5. Disposal of waste materials: Any waste material, including those classified as SRM, must be disposed of in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 to prevent the spread of BSE and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In conclusion, the European Commission is deeply committed to ensuring the safety of both human and animal health. Strict regulations and safety measures govern the production of gelatine and tallow from bovine organs, and these measures aim to minimize the risk of contamination by BSE-causing prions. By adhering to these guidelines, the European Union can continue to maintain the highest level of food safety and protect public health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Appearing Thursday on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the Last Man Standing star discussed attending Donald Trump’s inauguration and the political climate he thinks conservatives in his industry live in. “You get beat up if don’t believe what everybody believes,” he said. “This is like ’30s Germany.” Offended by the “deeply offensive characterization,” the Anne Frank Center has called for Allen to apologize. “Tim, have you lost your mind?” said Steven Goldstein, the center’s executive director in a statement. “No one in Hollywood today is subjecting you or anyone else to what the Nazis imposed on Jews in the 1930s – the world’s most evil program of dehumanization, imprisonment and mass brutality, implemented by an entire national government, as the prelude for the genocide of nearly an entire people.” Goldstein continued, “Sorry, Tim, that’s just not the same as getting turned down for a movie role. It’s time for you to leave your bubble to apologize to the Jewish people and, to be sure, the other peoples also targeted by the Nazis.” A representative for Allen did not immediately respond to EW’s request for comment. The mission of the organization, which is named after the young Jewish girl who kept a now published diary while hiding from the Nazis, is to call out “prejudice.” The group also “counters discrimination and advocates for the kinder and fairer world of which Anne Frank dreamed.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Jamie Answer:","completion":"Title: The Whispers of Willowfall Plot Summary: In the quiet, picturesque town of Willowfall, the residents have always believed in various urban legends. One legend in particular, the mysterious entity known as \\"Stare in Horror,\\" has left many citizens feeling uneasy. The legend speaks of an ominous creature who stares deep into the eyes of its prey, bringing psychological torment and horror upon them. As the terror ensues, the Stare in Horror then slowly consumes the sanity of its victims, driving them mad. Jamie, a young and ambitious psychology student, moves to Willowfall in hopes of finding a fresh start. Jamie becomes intrigued by the local folklore surrounding the Stare in Horror and decides to investigate the deeper psychological causes behind these tales. This becomes the subject of his study, and he delves headfirst into the mysteries entrenched in the town's history, unbeknownst to the danger lurking just beneath the surface. As Jamie begins to dig deeper, several unsolved disappearances catch his attention. He starts to question whether there might be some truth to the legend of the Stare in Horror. With every new clue, the townspeople, who were once friendly and open, gradually start growing distant and wary of Jamie's unsettling inquiries. Despite the increasing resistance from the community, Jamie forges a bond with a local woman named Sarah, who also believes that there may be more to the Stare in Horror than just an eerie myth. Together, they find eyewitness accounts of people who spoke about their last moments, overcome with dread and despair. They soon discover a pattern of disappearances linked to Stare in Horror - each victim was last seen staring in horror at a dark, shadowy figure. Feeling they are on the brink of a horrifying truth, Jamie and Sarah decide to visit the haunted woods where the dark entity is said to reside. As night falls and the fog rolls in, the pair becomes separated, and Jamie suddenly encounters the horrifying figure of the Stare in Horror. The creature begins to lay siege on Jamie's mind, forcing him to confront his deepest fears. He's paralyzed by terror. Barely holding onto his sanity, Jamie is determined to unmask the truth behind this malevolent force. With Sarah's help, they uncover the real story of the Stare in Horror - a vengeful spirit clawing its way back to seek revenge for an unspeakable crime committed against it decades ago. Jamie and Sarah must find a way to break the curse, free the spirit, and save the town before it falls into an everlasting nightmare. In a thrilling, unpredictable climax, Jamie and Sarah face off against the shadowy entity, ultimately uncovering the chilling secret at the core of Willowfall's frightful past. They join forces with the town to perform a ritual to banish the spirit of the Stare in Horror for good, bringing closure to the tormented souls it left in its wake. The Whispers of Willowfall is a nail-biting, psychological thriller that explores the power of human psyche, collective fear, and the dark secrets that lurk beneath small-town tranquility.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Question: I have a one-year-old female bulldog, who has recently taken to biting my shoes when we are in the park and I'm on the mobile. She can be slightly aggressive and I'm starting to get worried and a bit annoyed. How do I stop her? ----Susan, London. Answer: You need to get this problem under control before it could escalate . I always advise owners not to talk on the mobile phone when they go for a walk with their dogs, because they should be focusing on this time with their pets, but I know people have busy lives and need to make phone calls. The behavior she is showing is either controlling or playfulness, but they both result from the same issue ---- you are not paying attention to her. If you must make phone calls while on a walk, try to still engage with your dog by speaking towards her, playing some sorts of game and so on. If that doesn't work, you'll have to try more of a training approach. You will need a training line and some treats. Start your walk in the usual way, make a phone call, and when your dog starts displaying the undesired behavior, simply stop walking --- otherwise she will see it as a game. When she is calm and looking at you, or if she sits, give her a treat; then continue walking. If she starts up again, pick up the lead, gently pull it, and tell her \\"no\\". Then ask her to sit and give her a treat if she does. The aim of this is to try to get her to forget how much fun it is biting your shoes. Do little sessions every day --- and try not to answer the phone if you know it's going to be a long conversation. Be patient and good luck! Remember that if an animal shows signs of distress or discomfort, an early visit to the vet is always recommended. Question: How can Susan get her pet dog to forget the fun from biting her shoes?

Given the question: In a series circuit, the resistance increases as more resistors are added in series. By adding twenty more resistors to the series circuit in series, the total resistance of the circuit was increased or decreased? The answer is:","completion":"The total resistance in a series circuit increases as more resistors are added in series. When twenty more resistors are added to the series circuit in series, the total resistance of the circuit is increased. In a series circuit, the resistors are connected end-to-end, so the current has to pass through each resistor in turn. The current flowing through the resistors is the same as the total current flowing through the circuit. The total resistance in this type of circuit is directly proportional to the total number of resistors connected in series, as well as their individual resistance values. To put it mathematically, the total resistance in a series circuit (R_total) is equal to the sum of resistances of each resistor connected in series: R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + Rn Where R1, R2, R3, ... Rn are the individual resistance values of the resistors connected in series. As we add more resistors to the series circuit in series, the value of R_total increases accordingly. In our example, by adding twenty more resistors to the series circuit, the total resistance of the circuit is increased because we are adding more resistors and their resistance values to the overall sum. This increased resistance will cause the overall current flowing through the circuit to decrease due to Ohm's Law (V = IR), where V is the voltage across the circuit, I is the current flowing through it, and R is the total resistance. In conclusion, by adding twenty more resistors to the series circuit in series, the total resistance of the circuit is increased. This results in a decrease in the overall current flowing through the circuit, as the added resistance makes it more difficult for the current to flow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Congressional budget welcomes big bank bailouts once more despite White House opposition Congress has agreed to use federal deposit insurance, which was designed to protect the savings accounts of consumers, to cover risky trading by the nation’s biggest banks. In a small provision in the budget bill, Congress agreed to allow banks to house their trading of swaps and derivatives alongside customer deposits, which are insured by the federal government against losses. The budget move repeals a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act and, some say, lays the groundwork for future bailouts of banks who make irresponsibly risky trades. “It’s both a stealth move and indefensible,” said Dennis Kelleher, the head of Better Markets, a group that argues for great oversight of banks. In a note to clients, he later called it “a sneaky, midnight repeal”. The White House said on Wednesday it “strongly opposes” the provision. “The main purpose...is to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; this bill should not be used as a vehicle to add entirely unrelated financial regulatory provisions,” the White House said. “If Wall Street gets the upside in big bonuses from its high-risk derivatives deals, then it should also have to pay the downside for any losses,” Kelleher wrote. Richard Trumka, the head of labor union AFL-CIO, said his organizations also objected to the budget provision. “Dodd-Frank forced too-big-to-fail banks to move potentially toxic speculation in derivatives out of their government-insured banks,” Trumka said in a statement. “Wall Street’s friends in Congress are trying to once again put the public on the hook for the most dangerous aspects of the financial system.” Banks make their money primarily through two activities: lending out deposits to people or companies, and speculating on the markets. Laws like the defunct Glass-Steagall act were designed to separate the two activities. The Dodd-Frank rule recaptured a small part of that separation. The budget provision, however, retracts the rule, which has been a thorn in the paw of giant banks like JP Morgan and Citigroup. That rule, passed in 2010 and called the “swaps pushout rule”, dictated that banks had to keep certain arcane, risk-taking businesses away from customer deposits: swaps in stocks, commodities, and similar businesses. Other derivatives, however, could still sit in the section of the banks protected by government backing. The derivatives business is a lucrative and concentrated one: 95% of the trading in derivatives in the US are done by the five biggest banks, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. The banks have made more money in derivatives because they have government backing for deposits, Kelleher said. That’s no longer in place. “The swaps pushout provision was saying US taxpayers should not be paying for risky trading activities,” said Kelleher. Customer deposits – including the savings accounts of most Americans – are heavily regulated in size and scope by the federal government. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides a guarantee that, even if a bank goes under, customers can’t lose all of their money. The FDIC was created in response to worries about “runs on the bank” in the 1920s and 1930s as stock market speculation, then the Great Depression, caused financial panic and destabilized the financial system. Lobbyists for banks including Citigroup had previously tried to rewrite the provision, drafting as many as 70 of the 85 lines in one 2012 update. The budget provision is a success for lobbyists and the banks they work for, but a loss to Americans who will have to foot the bill again if banks take too much risk, said Kelleher. Derivatives, particularly in mortgages, were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis as insurers like AIG nearly collapsed under the weight of their risk. Excess exposure to derivatives created a restructuring of the financial system as investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went out of business due to fear over their financial exposure. Others fared better, but went through intense fear in the fall of 2008: Merrill Lynch had to be sold to Bank of America to survive, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to forge new identities as commercial banks, which allowed the Fed to protect them. The new budget provision once again acts as a promise that taxpayers will foot the bill for risky trading and speculation, Kelleher said. “If things go wrong, [the banks] get to run to the Fed for bailouts. That’s incredibly valuable to them,” he said. The surprise in the budget move is that everyone but banks considered the matter already settled. The Dodd-Frank rule dictated that banks would have to find new homes for their risk-taking unit to prevent them from taking risks with customer deposits. Even so, mistakes occurred. A notable example of a bank making a spectacular failing bet with customer money came in 2012, when JP Morgan used its 350bn chief investment office to make the infamous ‘London Whale’ trade, which led the bank to lose at least 6bn and led to a round of congressional hearings. JP Morgan increased its risk so much on the initial trade that the trader who initiated the bet called it “idiotic”. Swaps and derivatives are financial instruments that allow speculators to make bets on the future prices of stocks, bonds and commodities. Banks and companies also use these swaps and derivatives to hedge against price rises in corn, oil, and other commodities they use regularly; airlines, for instance, regularly use derivatives to hedge the price of fuel, and McDonald’s, among others, has hedges on the price of corn. Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2009, banks and their lobbyists have not given up hope in pushing back regulation. “Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the political world has buffeted the financial services sector with waves of new regulation in an attempt to punish the wicked and to make sure a similar crisis ‘never happens again’,” wrote Brian Gardner, Washington analyst for Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Gardner said such efforts have been met with resistance from the financial services industry: “Ever since the law was passed in 2010, industry and observers (us included) have been waiting for a ‘technical corrections’ bill to fix mistakes in the law,” Gardner, however, estimated the chances of that happening at under 60% due to “populism” that still exists in Congress, putting the largest banks “in the political doghouse”, he wrote. “We think Senate Republicans will be wary about being seen as too close to Wall Street, and will avoid making changes to Dodd-Frank that may expose them to attacks.” But Gardner echoed the hopes of many in the financial industry that yet more of Dodd-Frank’s reforms could be pulled back: “With the major pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act mostly in place and with a change in control of the Senate, we think 2015 offers the sector the first legitimate prospect for policymakers to review some of the new regulatory landscape and see what works and what they got wrong.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Congress has agreed to use federal deposit insurance to cover risky trading by the nation's biggest banks. This means that they will allow banks to house their trading of swaps and derivatives alongside customer deposits, which are insured by the federal government against losses. Some people say this could lead to future bailouts of banks who make risky trades. The White House is not happy about this decision, and they \\"strongly oppose\\" the provision.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: A cat standing on tile next to another cat.","completion":"In the given sentence, \\"A cat standing on tile next to another cat\\", the most important words can be determined by analyzing their roles in the sentence and the information they convey. Here are the most important words in this sentence: 1. Cat: The word \\"cat\\" is the subject of the sentence and is mentioned twice. The focus of the sentence revolves around the cats as they are what is being described in this scenario. The word \\"cat\\" gives us vital information about the type of animal present in the setting. As such, it is a key word. 2. Standing: The word \\"standing\\" is the main action or verb in the sentence which tells us what the cat is doing. It paints a picture of the cat's position and posture at a given moment. By understanding that the cat is \\"standing\\", readers can visualize and interpret the scene more accurately. 3. Tile: \\"Tile\\" is the surface on which the cat is standing. This word gives us the background context of the setting. By knowing that the cat is standing on tile, the reader can deduce that this scene might be taking place indoors, possibly in a kitchen or bathroom, as these areas commonly have tiled floors. 4. Next: This word indicates the position of the two cats in relation to one another. By using the word \\"next\\", it's clear that the two cats are in close proximity. This information is crucial to visualize the relationships between the elements in the scene, giving us a sense of distance and placement. 5. Another: The word \\"another\\" refers to the existence of a second cat in the scene. By including this word, the sentence informs the reader that there is more than just one cat in the scenario. This helps the reader understand that the setting involves multiple cats and not just a single animal. In summary, the most important words in the sentence \\"A cat standing on tile next to another cat\\" are \\"cat,\\" \\"standing,\\" \\"tile,\\" \\"next,\\" and \\"another\\". These words provide the essential information for a reader to visualize the scene, including animal type, action, background context, and the number and positioning of the subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\"Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \\"got on a great deal better\\" during the time he spent in New York: \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer is John Lennon. John Lennon asked his son Julian, \\"What's this?\\" when Julian showed him a watercolor painting of stars and a blonde girl that inspired the Beatles song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tell the employee you're hoping to speak with them about workplace expectations and performance, and schedule a time to sit down together.","completion":"In the next step of managing a lazy employee, both the manager and the employee sit down for their scheduled meeting. The manager carefully prepares for this discussion by gathering relevant information, such as specific instances of the employee's lazy behavior and its impact on the team. Additionally, the manager ensures that the meeting environment feels safe and constructive. During the meeting, the manager begins by discussing the purpose of the conversation and expressing their concerns about the employee's performance. They cite specific examples of the employee's laziness and explain how it affects the team's productivity and morale. The manager then encourages the employee to share their perspective on the situation and any potential reasons behind their lackluster performance. By actively listening to the employee's viewpoint, the manager aims to identify any underlying issues that may be contributing to the laziness. After gaining insight into the employee's situation, the manager and the employee collaboratively develop a plan to address and rectify the performance issues. This plan may include setting achievable goals, providing additional resources or support, and outlining the consequences of continued underperformance. Finally, the manager establishes a timeline for progress checks and follow-up meetings to ensure the employee is making improvements and staying accountable.

Are Republicans secretly terrified of President-Elect Trump policies, but are unwilling to admit it? How loyal are Congressional Republicans to President-Elect Trump? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"To answer these questions, we will gather information and analyze the political context around President-Elect Trump, Republicans, and their loyalties. We will then compare the meanings of these questions. Step 1: Gather information about President-Elect Trump's policies We will research and analyze the policies advocated by President-Elect Trump during his campaign and the period leading up to his inauguration. By understanding his positions, we can assess how they may align with Republican Party values. Step 2: Assess potential concerns Based on our understanding of President-Elect Trump's policies, we can then identify which aspects of his proposed policies might potentially concern Republicans, specifically those who are traditionally conservative or have differing views on certain policy platforms. Step 3: Evaluate the level of Republican support We will analyze statements and actions made by Republican members of Congress as well as their voting records on President-Elect Trump's proposed policies. This can help us gauge the level of loyalty and support among Congressional Republicans for President-Elect Trump. Step 4: Explore reasons for any apprehension If we find that there is a significant level of apprehension or concern among Congressional Republicans, we will attempt to understand why they may feel the need to hide their concerns or why they may not openly voice their apprehensions. Step 5: Compare the meanings of the questions We will now analyze whether the two given questions have the same meaning. Question 1: \\"Are Republicans secretly terrified of President-Elect Trump policies, but are unwilling to admit it?\\" This question implies that Republicans may have concerns or fears related to President-Elect Trump's policies, but they do not openly express those feelings. It suggests that they might be keeping their feelings hidden for certain reasons. Question 2: \\"How loyal are Congressional Republicans to President-Elect Trump?\\" This question focuses on the degree of loyalty among Congressional Republicans towards President-Elect Trump. It does not imply that Republicans are necessarily keeping any concerns hidden or are opposed to his policies, but it is interested in the depth of their support. After comparing the meanings, we can conclude that these questions are not the same. The first question assumes that Republicans might be scared or concerned, but are not openly expressing those feelings. The second question focuses on loyalty and support without suggesting any hidden concerns. Both questions are related to the dynamics between Republicans and President-Elect Trump, but they address different aspects of this relationship."},{"prompt":"Robin recently met her mother after not being around her since birth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: How to Beat Roaming Fees While Traveling Abroad Jeff Gardner, the small-business owner I wrote about last week, was one such customer. Over four days in Jamaica he racked up an 11,000 Verizon bill after trying — unsuccessfully — to text with his cellphone and to check e-mail on his laptop using a wireless card. The biggest culprit: roaming fees. The fact that Verizon has lowered Mr. Gardner’s bill to about 2,500 (negotiations are ongoing) since that article appeared suggests that carriers are well aware of the get-me-to-a-hospital sticker shock roaming fees can cause. In fact, Verizon says that it is trying to educate customers about how to minimize roaming costs. Last month, for example, the company introduced an online Trip Planner that allows travelers to estimate how much text and data might cost for planned trips. (Users must list their destination, length of trip and type of phone.) In April, Verizon created a YouTube video, “Tips for Traveling Overseas,” which draws attention to its global data plans and the automated alerts it sends when roaming charges exceed certain thresholds. AT&T has upgraded its international data plans for travelers. (More on those below.) Despite such efforts, avoiding high roaming charges requires attention and vigilance. Here are a few ways to control costs. USE WI-FI To avoid roaming fees completely, select airplane mode or turn off data roaming on your smartphone until you are in a Wi-Fi hot spot, where you can check e-mail or use the Web at much lower costs (often free). If you were to do either while roaming, your bill would show it: an e-mail with a 5-megapixel photo, for example, would require your phone to download about 2 megabytes of data at a cost of about 20 a MB from either Verizon or AT&T. RENT A WI-FI BUBBLE If you can’t plan your trip around Internet cafes, hotel lounges or other free Wi-Fi spots, consider renting a portable Wi-Fi bubble. Tep Wireless, a smartphone rental company based in London, offers a pocket-sized Wi-Fi device that connects to local 3G signals in 16 European countries and allows you to use Wi-Fi with up to five devices simultaneously. Rates begin at 15 a day for three days (the longer you rent, the cheaper it gets) and include shipping to your home and pre-paid shipping labels for returning the device. If you are traveling in a single country like Spain, Italy or Britain, there is no limit on data use. For those touring Europe, Tep has a pocket Wi-Fi device that works in multiple countries but limits data to 50 MB a day. For those traveling across a broader range of countries, the National Geographic International MiFi, which is available at CellularAbroad.com, offers portable Wi-Fi in more than 100 countries. Travelers pay 82 to rent the device, including two-week shipping as well as data rates, which vary by country but are less compared with roaming fees charged by United States-based carriers. Cellular Abroad also has single-country MiFi rentals with unlimited data rates as low as 12 a day, plus shipping, for travelers spending two weeks in countries like Australia, China and Italy. For Europe-bound travelers, Tep also has rental packages for smartphones (loaded with apps like Skype, Facebook and Twitter) with rates from 11 a day for five days, including unlimited Internet and local texts, but not calls. CONSIDER A DATA PACKAGE If you don’t want to be limited to Wi-Fi in order to read e-mail or access the Internet, consider an international data package, which will allow you to roam at low pre-paid rates. Last month AT&T introduced international add-on options that provide travelers with more than double the data provided in previous deals. Travelers who choose an add-on, which is tacked on to existing domestic calling and data plans, now get 50 MB for 25 a month compared with 20 MB previously, and up to 800 MB for 200 a month versus 200 MB. The data packages are available in more than 100 countries. Verizon Wireless sells similar global data packages ranging from 30 a month for 25 MB to 100 a month for 70 MB for travelers bound for Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Europe. Still, many of its phones are not compatible with foreign carriers. (AT&T and T-Mobile use signals that work in many other countries.) For customers headed to countries where Verizon phones aren’t compatible, the company has a loaner phone for anyone taking a trip of 21 days or more. (Customers will need to order it in advance and pay the 9.99 shipping charge.) And T-Mobile sells an unlimited international e-mail plan for BlackBerry users that is 19.99 a month. Regardless of the data plan you choose, be sure to set your phone’s usage tracker to zero so that you can keep track of how much data you are using while you’re gone. AT&T charges 10 for each 10 MB of data used above and beyond its international data plans. Verizon charges between 2.05 and 5.12 per megabyte of extra data. If you don’t want to worry about monitoring your data use at all, a pre-paid data package is an easy way to stick to your budget. Telestial, a communications retailer that provides wireless services for travelers, offers deals for smartphone and tablets with rates as low as 1 per megabyte in many countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain. To get those rates travelers must also buy a Passport SIM card (29), which allows your unlocked cellphone to work overseas and includes 10 of credit for local calls, texts and data. Once you hit your data limit, you must add money to the card if you want to use more. You can also set up auto-loading so that whenever you use up, say, a 10 balance, Telestial will automatically load another 25 (or other pre-determined amount) to your account. BOOST YOUR DATA PACKAGE It has recently become possible to get more out of those international data packages, thanks to new mobile tools that condense downloaded data. Onavo (onavo.com) a new Tel Aviv-based start-up, has an iPhone app that compresses users’ Web, e-mail and application data. The company states that customers who buy, say, a 50 MB, 25-a-month global data package can triple the data by using Onavo. Opera, a Norwegian browser maker, offers free data compression for Internet surfing (but not downloads or videos) via a downloadable mobile Web browser called Opera Mini, which works on more than 3,000 phones, including Android, BlackBerry and iPhone models. Opera estimates that users with a 50 MB data plan could get up to 500 MB by surfing the Web using the Mini browser on their phone. Type m.opera.com into your phone’s browser, or download it from Apple’s App Store, the Android Market or Nokia’s Ovi store.","completion":"This news article is about ways to avoid roaming fees when traveling abroad.

She added: \\"In our region we've seen the effect of that increase in numbers come out in congestion, which means that some peak time trains can frankly feel like cattle trucks at the best of times.\\" But the RMT's general secretary Mick Cash called the decision a \\"shocking indictment of government policy and the privatised railway that a company that has been running the franchise for 20 years is not entrusted with the service going forward\\".

In this case, the supposed perturbation would be directly impacting a step of the process. The reason behind this is that the increased amount of air entering the bronchial tissue leads to a larger quantity of oxygen molecules available for the gas exchange process. This increased availability of oxygen molecules will cause a greater number of oxygen molecules to be diffused across the alveoli walls and into the surrounding capillaries, which will then result in a greater concentration of oxygen in the bloodstream.

Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"No, these two sentences do not convey the same information. They differ in the context of the standard arguments and the specific algebraic structures they refer to. Let's analyze both sentences in detail: Sentence 1: Standard arguments in homological algebra imply that these cohomology groups are independent of the choice of injective resolution of \`\` E ''. In this sentence, the context is homological algebra, which is a branch of algebra that studies the algebraic structures (such as abelian groups, modules, and chain complexes) arising from the study of topological spaces and their algebraic invariants. The sentence mentions cohomology groups, which are fundamental tools for understanding these algebraic structures. Cohomology groups are derived from the study of cochain complexes, and they measure the failure of certain algebraic constructions to be exact. The sentence also talks about the injective resolution of \\"E,\\" which is a specific process used to replace a given object (in this case, the object \\"E\\") with an injective object in a category while preserving properties of the original object, such as its homology or cohomology groups. The sentence claims that the cohomology groups are independent of the choice of injective resolution, meaning that different injective resolutions for the same object will yield the same cohomology groups. Sentence 2: Standard arguments in the injective algebra imply that these groups of cohomologists are independent of the choice of homological resolution of \`\` E ''. In this sentence, the context is injective algebra, which seems to mistakenly combine the terms 'injective' (related to injective objects or injective resolution) with 'algebra' instead of the correct context being 'homological algebra.' The sentence is not clear in what it means by \\"injective algebra.\\" The sentence mentions \\"groups of cohomologists,\\" which is likely meant to be cohomology groups, similar to the first sentence. It also talks about the \\"homological resolution,\\" which could be a mistaken reference to 'injective resolution' or 'projective resolution,' both of which are concepts in homological algebra that involve constructing resolutions for specific purposes or preserving certain properties. Given the inconsistencies in sentence 2, it is not clear if it conveys the same information as sentence 1 or if it is attempting to discuss a different topic. While both sentences refer to cohomology groups and resolutions, sentence 2 contains unclear and incorrect terms, making it difficult to determine whether it communicates the same information as sentence 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive. The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy.

He said:\\"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.\\" Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who\\"faked smiles\\"throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind? ? The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge...

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which fruit had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation, apples or ginger? Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","completion":"From the given paragraph, the fruit that had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation is Joey's candied ginger.

Given the context of the initial statement, where the woman is lying next to a pool, it would be natural for her to continue in a similar relaxed or exercise-focused behavior after kicking off her sandals. In this case, laying back down and starting to do situps would be a reasonable follow-up action. This scenario aligns well with the setting and the woman's actions, as people often exercise before going for a swim or while lounging near a pool. Options A and D involve sudden appearances of another character -- a child or another woman -- which has not been introduced in the initial scenario, making these transitions less natural. Meanwhile, option B describes actions with the feet and legs that seem unrelated and inconsistent with the prior action of kicking off sandals. Therefore, option C is the most natural continuation of the scenario. It maintains a consistent setting and flow of the narrative, keeping the focus on the blonde woman by the poolside. This option also keeps a good continuity in her actions: lying down, sitting up to take off the sandals, and then laying back down again to do situps, suggesting a potential workout routine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the hint, patient B with a low blood glucose level is more likely to produce the hormone glucagon.

Buried Seed Vault Opens in Arctic [UPDATED, 8:30 a.m.] After several years of planning and digging, the world has its first secure, deep-frozen repository for backup supplies of seeds from hundreds of thousands of plant varieties that underpin agriculture. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault was built into a frigid mountainside in Norway’s northernmost archipelago, deep in the Arctic. It had its ceremonial opening Tuesday morning in the frigid gloom of the Arctic winter. [UPDATE: Many readers wondered about whether it was too close to sea level. But, as I learned in my three Arctic trips, things up there are way more spread out than they appear. The tunnel entrance is 130 meters, or about 400 feet, above sea level. So all can rest easy on that front.] There are something like 1,400 seed banks around the world, guarding samples of crop plants ranging from alfalfa to yams. But, as I wrote last year, this agricultural archive is eroding under forces including war, storms, scant money or bad management, particularly in the worldâs poorest or most turbulent places. A Fort Knox has been needed, many experts said. Now they have it. Some advocates for strengthening the capacity of local communities to sustain their agricultural traditions and crop diversity on their own aren’t happy about this kind of centralized approach, though (more on this below). No one questions the vulnerability of many of the world’s seed stores. Iraqâs bank of ancient wheat, barley and other crop strains in the town of Abu Ghraib — made infamous for other reasons — was looted during the war (mainly for the containers holding grain samples, not for the grain itself). An international rice repository in the Philippines was shredded by a typhoon. The new repository is intended to be an insurance policy for individual countries and also for humanity more generally, should larger-scale disaster strike (anything from pestilence to an asteroid impact). The Norwegian government put up more than 7 million for construction. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is providing money to help developing countries package and ship seed samples, as part of a broader 30-million project to protect the genetic diversity of the world’s main food crops. The ongoing operation of the seed vault will be paid for through the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which is maintained by contributions from countries, international agencies, and foundations. A secure supply of thousands of varieties of keystone crops like rice and wheat will be ever more important, experts say, as populations grow, climate changes, and people keep moving species around the global, both intentionally and accidentally. Grain.org, a group based in Spain focused on strengthening regional agriculture, was one of the few entities criticizing the focus on the seed vault. The group worries that such moves take away intellectual property rights to crop varieties from the farming communities that developed them and provide a false sense of confidence that safe storage, on its own, can sustain agricultural diversity. As the group noted in a news release today (hat tip to Danny Bloom): Thousands of accessions have died in storage, as many have been rendered useless for lack of basic information about the seeds, and countless others have lost their unique characteristics or have been genetically contaminated during periodic grow-outs. This has happened throughout the ex situ system, not just in gene banks of developing countries. So the issue is not about being for or against gene banks, it is about the sole reliance on one conservation strategy that, in itself, has a lot of inherent problems. The deeper problem with the single focus on ex situ seed storage, that the Svalbard Vault reinforces, is that it is fundamentally unjust. It takes seeds of unique plant varieties away from the farmers and communities who originally created, selected, protected and shared those seeds and makes them inaccessible to them. The logic is that as people’s traditional varieties get replaced by newer ones from research labs -â seeds that are supposed to provide higher yields to feed a growing population â the old ones have to be put away as “raw material” for future plant breeding. This system forgets that farmers are the world’s original, and ongoing, plant breeders. It’s a noteworthy point. The groups funding the seed vault, including the Gates Foundation, say they are also pouring money into creating databases and other mechanisms for maintaining poor countries’ access to the full array of crop strains. But what about the farmers in the field? In a world tending toward monoculture, how much of this intergovernmental work helps sustain farming diversity, as opposed to museum-style genetic diversity? Do farmers matter? Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a secure deep-frozen repository for backup supplies of seeds from hundreds of thousands of plant varieties, has been built into a frigid mountainside in Norway's Arctic region.

In The Motorcycle Diaries, at what location does Che Guevera muse how a civilization capable of creating such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the urban decay of a nearby city? What is the answer?","completion":"In The Motorcycle Diaries, Che Guevara muses about the contrast between the beauty of an ancient civilization and the urban decay of a modern city while visiting Incan ruins in Peru. Specifically, this moment of reflection occurs as Guevara and his friend, Alberto Granado, explore the breathtaking archaeological site of Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu, an ancient Incan city built in the 15th century, is located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru and is considered a testament to the architectural and engineering capabilities of the Inca Empire. It was abandoned by the Incas just a century later, most likely due to the Spanish conquest, and remained undiscovered to the outside world until 1911 when it was brought to global attention by historian Hiram Bingham. While contemplating the magnificent ruins of Machu Picchu, Guevara is struck by their beauty, as well as the sophistication and accomplishments of the Inca civilization – a civilization capable of creating such a marvelous place. In contrast, he reflects upon the modern city of Lima, which represents urban decay, pollution, and socioeconomic problems of the contemporary world. Guevara's musings not only highlight the disparity between the advanced, harmonious society of the Incas and the troubled urban society of the modern world but also serve as deeper metaphors for social issues and injustices that pervade Latin America. These contemplations on Machu Picchu would later become a turning point for Guevara, ultimately shaping his revolutionary ideology and commitment to fighting for social justice and equality across the continent. In summary, Che Guevara muses about the contrast between the beauty of an ancient civilization and the urban decay of a modern city at Machu Picchu in Peru, comparing its magnificence to the problems faced by nearby Lima."},{"prompt":"Q:Błonie Lubusz Voivodeship - Błonie [ˈbwɔɲe] (German: Blankfeld) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Skąpe within Świebodzin County Lubusz Voivodeship in western Poland.

Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the answer you found is not a correct answer to the question of how to determine if a volcano is extinct. To determine if a volcano is extinct, scientists evaluate several factors, including the following: 1. Time since the last eruption: An extinct volcano is one that has not erupted for a long period of time and is not expected to erupt again. Although there is no specific time frame that separates extinct volcanoes from dormant ones, a volcano may be considered extinct if it has not erupted in over 10,000 years. 2. Geological evidence: Scientists study the volcanic rock layers and formations, looking for signs of erosion, weathering, and other indications that the volcano has not erupted in a long time. Extinct volcanoes often show significant erosion, which suggests that the volcanic activity has ceased. 3. Geothermal activity: Analyzing the heat and seismic activity around a volcano can help determine if it is still active. Extinct volcanoes generally have low subsurface temperatures and minimal seismic activity. 4. Presence of magma: Research on the composition and movement of magma beneath the Earth's surface can provide crucial information on the likelihood of future eruptions. If there is little to no magma present under a volcano, or if the magma has solidified, the volcano may be considered extinct. 5. Tectonic setting: The tectonic setting of a volcano plays a significant role in determining its expected activity. If a volcano is located in an area where tectonic activity has ceased or moved elsewhere, it may be considered extinct. In conclusion, determining if a volcano is extinct involves examining the time since its last eruption, geological evidence, geothermal activity, magma presence, and tectonic setting.

Pick your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"(1). No. Although both sentences describe a creature with dorsal features, they do not convey the same meaning. In the first sentence, the creature is characterized by having \\"12 dorsal spines\\" and \\"15 to 17 dorsal soft rays.\\" Dorsal spines are typically hard, sharp, and pointed structures along the dorsal (top) side of certain animals, like fish. On the other hand, dorsal soft rays refer to flexible, segmented, and branched fin structures that can also be found in some fish species. The second sentence presents a creature with \\"12 dorsal soft spines\\" and \\"15 to 17 dorsal beams.\\" Dorsal soft spines are a combination of the terms in the first sentence, and it is not a commonly used term. It could be a mistake or it might be trying to describe a soft spine structure, but it lacks clarity. Dorsal beams, however, provide an entirely new descriptor that may refer to different structural elements. However, without clear context, it's hard to determine what \\"dorsal beams\\" would represent. Because these sentences do not share the same descriptors, and there is ambiguity in the second sentence, they do not hold the same meaning, which leads to the choice: (1).

Question: Who tries to warn the family in the station wagon? Movie title: The Hitcher Movie plot: Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell), a young man delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego, spots a man hitchhiking and gives him a ride. The man, giving his name as John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), is a brooding, soft spoken man; when Jim passes a stranded car, however, Ryder's personality suddenly shifts. Ryder calmly states that the reason the car is stranded is because he murdered and mutilated the driver, and he intends to do the same to Jim. Ryder produces a switchblade knife and taunts Jim for several moments, before Jim realizes Ryder never put on his seat belt and that the passenger door isn't fully closed and knocks him out of the car.Relieved, Jim continues on his journey, until a station wagon carrying a family on vacation passes, and Jim is horrified to see that Ryder has hitched a ride with them. Jim attempts to signal the family, but ends up nearly totaling his car; when he finally catches up to the station wagon, Jim discovers the entire family has been horribly mutilated by Ryder.The movie shifts into an elongated chase sequence, which finds Jim trying to flee Ryder both on foot and in his car, to no avail; wherever Jim runs, Ryder finds him: It seems that Ryder, impressed with Jim's show of bravery by knocking him out of the car, has decided that Jim is the man who is finally going to put his killing spree to an end.Jim then finds Ryder at an abandoned gas station. Ryder knocks down the gas pumps with a pickup truck and then lights a match. Both cars drive off and the gas station explodes. Jim retreats to a roadside diner, where he meets a pretty young waitress named Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and calls the police. She then serves him a cheeseburger and french fries. He eats these in solitude, until discovering that one of the fries is a severed finger.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition .","completion":"The given phrase can be perceived as being positive with some reservations. It is important to analyze and break down the different elements present within the sentence to understand the overall sentiment that it evokes. To start with, the phrase notes that the film is \\"saved,\\" which implies a positive rescue or redemption of its content from potentially negative aspects. In this case, the negative aspect mentioned is \\"kids-cute sentimentality.\\" The use of the term \\"saved\\" suggests that the film has managed to overcome sentimentality and shallow emotional appeal. Second, the phrase mentions \\"a warmth that is n't faked.\\" The use of \\"warmth\\" indicates a genuine emotional connection within the film, possibly between characters or towards the audience. Presenting a \\"warmth\\" that \\"isn't faked\\" denotes authenticity in the film's portrayal of emotions, leading to a more positive viewing experience for the audience. Lastly, the phrase describes \\"a stately sense of composition,\\" which further adds to the positive aspects of the film. A \\"stately sense of composition\\" denotes an elegant and well-executed arrangement of elements within the film, such as its cinematography, plot, or acting. The description of the composition as \\"stately\\" highlights the level of mastery and refinement present in the filmmaking process. Taking these observations into account, it becomes clear that the phrase is generally positive. Nevertheless, the notion that the film needed to be \\"saved\\" from excessive sentimentality introduces a hint of reservation and ambiguity, suggesting that there were potential pitfalls to its success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this context, it emphasizes just how close the speaker was to agreeing to the deal. The additional phrase \\"then and there\\" further emphasizes the immediacy of the situation and that the decision was almost made at that exact time and place, without any delay or hesitation. To break it down further, the phrase \\"I'd been\\" is a contraction for \\"I had been,\\" reflecting a past action that was occurring just before another past action or event.

The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self. Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.

After their first loss of the season, the Steelers traveled to Baltimore to play the Ravens. The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3-1. The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent. The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012. It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002. Seventeen points marked the largest margin of victory for the Steelers in Baltimore in series history, and the largest such margin against any team in Baltimore since the Steelers defeated the Colts in Memorial Stadium by twenty-six points in the 1976 NFL Playoffs.

For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer. From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920. In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were \\"discovered\\" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues.

Bill's new aquarium that he bought would not fit through his back doorway; the","completion":"dimensions were much larger than he had anticipated. In his excitement, he had failed to properly measure the space before purchasing the massive aquatic habitat. The aquarium was a stunning 120-gallon masterpiece, featuring sleek curved edges and a sturdy reinforced metallic frame. It was designed to be the centerpiece of Bill's newly renovated living room. However, getting it inside the house was proving to be a significant challenge. When Bill realized the dilemma he was facing, he began to evaluate his options and brainstorm possible solutions. His first thought was to disassemble the door frame, allowing for greater clearance. Although it seemed like a potential solution, Bill was concerned about the time-consuming nature of this approach and the potential damage to his home. Moreover, Bill considered removing one of the windows to provide a passageway for the large aquarium. Unfortunately, after a careful examination, he found that none of the windows were large enough to accommodate the aquarium. Next, he contemplated taking apart the aquarium to transport it into the house in smaller pieces. However, upon reviewing the structure's complex design and the risk of damaging it during dismantling, Bill decided against this option. Feeling increasingly frustrated yet determined to find a solution, Bill contacted a few friends to seek their input. One friend suggested erecting a small pulley system to hoist the aquarium up and over the house, lowering it onto the back porch. Though this idea had merit, it posed a considerable level of risk for the expensive and delicate aquarium and the safety of everyone involved. Another friend recommended contacting a professional moving company that specializes in handling oversized and delicate items. He even shared the contact information of a reputable company known for such services. Bill took this advice to heart and reached out to the moving company. After explaining the situation, the company assured Bill that they have experience handling such challenges and provided him with an affordable quote to transport the aquarium safely into his home. Relieved that he had found a viable solution, Bill scheduled the moving company to handle the situation. On the day of the move, the team arrived at Bill's house equipped with the necessary tools and expertise. They thoroughly assessed the situation and devised a plan that involved using a custom-built platform and heavy-duty straps. This method allowed them to carefully lift the aquarium, which was then carried and maneuvered through the narrowest point of the doorway. After much effort and teamwork, the moving team was able to successfully bring the aquarium inside Bill's home without causing any damage to the aquarium or the house. Bill was thrilled to finally have his centerpiece in the living room and thanked the moving company profusely for their help. In the end, Bill learned a valuable lesson about the importance of proper planning and measurements when purchasing large items. He decided to be more attentive to details in the future and also appreciated the significance of seeking assistance from experienced professionals when facing such challenging situations. All in all, Bill's new aquarium journey taught him more than he had anticipated, and he was grateful for overcoming the obstacles and enjoying the mesmerizing aquatic environment he had always dreamed of."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I did n't get to go in the ocean this time , but I ' m scared of it anyway , so that was n't much of a loss for me . Why is the narrator unwilling to go swimming ?","completion":"The narrator is unwilling to go swimming in the ocean due to their fear of it. In the text, they mention that they didn't have the opportunity to go in the ocean during their visit to Ocean City, but they add that they are scared of it anyway, implying that their fear is the primary reason for their unwillingness to swim. Additionally, they downplay the significance of not being able to go into the ocean by referring to the fact that it wasn't much of loss for them. There could be various reasons behind the narrator's fear of the ocean, some of which include: 1. Fear of the unknown: The ocean is vast and filled with unknown creatures and phenomena. A fear of the unknown makes the narrator feel uneasy and apprehensive about swimming in it. They may be afraid of encountering strange sea creatures, dangerous underwater currents, or unpredictable weather conditions. 2. Fear of drowning: The fear of drowning is a common phobia that many people share. The narrator may have a heightened sense of anxiety related to the possibility of getting caught in a rip current, not being able to reach the shore, or encountering a situation where their swimming skills are insufficient to keep them afloat. 3. Past traumatic experiences: The narrator might have had a traumatic experience in the ocean in the past. This could include near-drowning situations, encounters with marine life, or witnessing an accident. These experiences may have left the narrator with lasting emotional scars and make them reluctant to swim in the ocean again. 4. Limited swimming skills: The narrator might have limited swimming skills, which makes them feel unsafe and insecure about venturing into the ocean. It could be that they never mastered swimming techniques or are not confident in their ability to swim in open waters. 5. Social anxiety: The narrator could be hesitant to swim in the ocean due to the social aspect of the experience. Swimming in a public beach environment might make them feel self-conscious, vulnerable, or judged by others, making them avoid swimming altogether. 6. Fear of pollution: The possibility of the ocean being polluted with toxins, bacteria, or debris might be another reason for the narrator's apprehension. This fear of encountering pollution during swimming can cause them to avoid ocean swimming altogether. In conclusion, the narrator is unwilling to go swimming in the ocean due to their fear of it. While the specific reasons for the fear are not explicitly mentioned, there could be several explanations such as the fear of the unknown, fear of drowning, past traumatic experiences, limited swimming skills, social anxiety, and fear of pollution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the man who beat up Le Cocq?, using the article: Guru Pitka is the #2 Guru in the world, after Deepak Chopra. A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in PowerPoint slide shows. In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The full name of the man who beat up Le Cocq is Darren Roanoke."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A veterinary student who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It is there that he meets Marlena, the beautiful young star of the equestrian act, who is married to August, the charismatic but twisted circus owner. He also meets Rosie, an elephant who seems untrainable until he discovers a way to reach her.The movie begins with an elderly man (who is actually Jacob - Hal Holbrook) outside after a circus performance, looking for his ride, when younger workers notice him and ask if he is lost or needs to go back to the home. He insists that he doesn't belong in a home and becomes quite upset when they persistently ask, but then apologizes for his rude behavior. The young men bring him inside from the rain, and while one man goes about calling the old folks home, the other notices Jacob looking at the pictures hanging on the wall. The young man is shocked to find out Jacob knew about the circus and even more impressed when he says he was there, right in the middle of it. It is explained that it was the most famous circus disaster in history. The young man passes him an old photograph of a young woman sitting on an elephant's trunk, and Jacob tears up. The young man asks Jacob to tell him what happened in 1931, and so the story begins.The movie flashes back to 1931, as a young man (younger Jacob - Robert Pattinson) was preparing to take his final exam at vet school.

Playing along with Lethal's antics, Hogan placed him in charge of the show for his one-week absence due to a business trip. After raising the ire of Hogan's business partner Eric Bischoff with his comedic booking ideas, Bischoff placed Lethal in a two-on-one handicap match against Beer Money, Inc.; Lethal, however, managed to win the match after surprising Robert Roode with a roll-up. On the May 3 episode of Impact!, Hogan gave Lethal Ric Flair's Hall of Fame ring that Abyss had won from him the previous week. When Lethal, now imitating Flair, was confronted by Flair himself, he claimed that he meant no disrespect and out of respect towards Flair, returned the ring to him. This, however, wasn't enough for Flair, who attacked Lethal along with A.J. Styles, Desmond Wolfe and Beer Money, Inc., before he was saved by Abyss, Team 3D and the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam. At Sacrifice, Lethal came out during the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between champion Rob Van Dam and challenger A.J. Styles, and locked Ric Flair in a Figure-four leglock in order to prevent him from interfering in the match. On the May 20 episode of Impact!, Lethal competed in his first match after dropping the Black Machismo gimmick, and teamed up with Rob Van Dam to defeat Beer Money, Inc. in a tag team match. After the match, Lethal brawled with Flair. At Slammiversary VIII, Lethal defeated Flair's protégé A.J. Styles in a singles match. After defeating Desmond Wolfe, another one of Flair's allies, on the June 17 episode of Impact!, Hogan granted him a match with Flair at Victory Road. On July 11 at Victory Road, Lethal defeated Flair with his own move, the figure-four leglock. On the August 5 episode of Impact!, Lethal faced Flair in a rematch, this time contested under Street Fight rules, with A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode and James Storm of Flair's Fortune stable banned from ringside. Flair managed to win the match, after an interference from X Division Champion Douglas Williams, who would officially join Fortune the following week. On September 6, at the tapings of the September 16 episode of Impact!, Lethal defeated Williams to win the X Division Championship for the fourth time. On September 23, at a live event in New York City, Lethal lost the X Division Championship to Amazing Red. Lethal regained the title two days later at a live event in Rahway, New Jersey.

University of Miami researcher guessed shark was between 800 and 1,000 pounds.","completion":"Title: Record-Breaking Female Bull Shark Caught Off Florida Coast Subtitle: Researchers estimate the enormous shark to be between 800 and 1,000 pounds. Introduction: In a remarkable discovery off the coast of Florida in May, an enormous female bull shark was captured, setting a new record as the largest on record. This incredible catch has stunned both researchers and the general public alike, prompting further investigations into these powerful creatures. A researcher from the University of Miami estimated the shark to weigh between 800 and 1,000 pounds, making it an extraordinary example of its species. Step 1: Discuss the Capture The record-breaking female bull shark was caught by a team of marine biologists and fishermen who were conducting research in the waters off the coast of Florida. They managed to reel her in using specially designed fishing gear that could withstand the strength and weight of the massive shark, ensuring that the catch was conducted as safely as possible for both the people involved and the shark. Step 2: Explain the Significance This unprecedented discovery has captured the attention of marine researchers worldwide, who are excited to study the extraordinary creature to learn more about the biology and life cycle of bull sharks. The sheer size of this particular shark is a testament to the adaptability and power of the species, demonstrating just how formidable they can be in their natural habitat. Step 3: Describe the Plans for the Shark Given the rarity and scientific value of this enormous female bull shark, researchers have taken steps to ensure the shark's future well-being. The University of Miami researcher involved in the process will be conducting further studies on the shark, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the world's knowledge and understanding of these mysterious creatures. Step 4: Discuss the Role of Bull Sharks in Marine Ecosystems Bull sharks play a vital role in maintaining the balance and health of marine ecosystems. As apex predators, they keep populations of smaller marine animals in check, preventing any one species from reaching numbers that could destabilize their respective ecosystems. The continued study of these remarkable creatures will hopefully reveal more insight into their ecological importance and contribute to the ongoing conservation efforts for sharks in general. Conclusion: The capture of the largest recorded female bull shark marks a significant milestone in the world of marine biology. The shark is not only a symbol of the strength and adaptability of its species, but also serves as a reminder of the impact that human activity and intervention can have on these complex ecosystems. Researchers are eager to uncover new information about this incredible creature and use it to advance our understanding of bull sharks, ultimately aiding in the preservation of these essential members of our oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. I am facing a new situation today: Alexander is heating up water in his kitchen because he is preparing to make pasta. He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the given situation, it can be inferred that the container with particles with lower average kinetic energy is Container B. Let's consider each container in detail: Container A has been heating up for a long amount of time, which means the particles within the liquid – in this case, water – have had ample time to absorb heat energy. As the liquid absorbs heat, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The increased kinetic energy allows the molecules to move around more rapidly and become more likely to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Container B, on the other hand, has only been heating up for a short amount of time. In comparison to Container A, the particles in Container B have had less time to absorb heat energy, and thus have lower average kinetic energy. Consequently, the rate of evaporation in Container B would be lower, as fewer molecules have the necessary kinetic energy to transition into the vapor phase. To recap, when comparing Container A and Container B, the latter has particles with lower average kinetic energy due to the shorter heating duration. This means that, in the context of the boiling process, Container A would be closer to reaching the boiling point where the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the external pressure, making it more suitable for cooking pasta shortly."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: HORRIBLE Review: This filter is horrible.

Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Annie Dillard believes that Answer: A). not enough information; B). Everyday is important; C). Life does not matter; D). Days are inconsequential; Answer:","completion":"B). Everyday is important"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're a fan of Gothic horror, then you're definitely absolutely guaranteed to LOVE this wondrous Italian 60's film \\"Castle of Blood\\". We're really talking about creepily creaking doors, eerie portraits that appear to be moving, spontaneously dying candles although there's no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors. Speaking in terms of atmosphere and style, this masterful piece of Gothic film-making is one of the best out there; just one tiny league below landmarks such as \\"Black Sunday\\", \\"The Three Faces of Fear\\" and \\"Curse of the Crying Woman\\". The prominent directors duo Sergio Corbucci (\\"The Great Silence\\", \\"Django\\") and Antonio Margheriti (\\"Cannibal Apocalypse\\", \\"Killer Fish\\") are successful in all areas, including a powerful plot (one that is genuinely nightmare inducing), ultra-sinister scenery and filming locations, stylish black and white photography, spine-chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers. Barbara Steele, starlet of the aforementioned \\"Black Sunday\\" and Italian goth-muse number one, shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she's literally surrounded by excellent co-players. One of them, Silvano Tranquilli, even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author Edgar Allan Poe. The story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager. If he  Alan Foster  would survive spending one night in the infamous Blackwood Castle, he receives the astonishing reward of 10 and a newspaper interview with Poe. Needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds, even for somebody like Alan Foster who's a firm non-believer in ghosts and vampires. The night starts out great for him, as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams, but gradually he learns that Blackwood Castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity. I don't know about you, but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time. Co-director Antonio Margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well, because he remade it himself a couple of years later as \\"Web of the Spider\\". That movie had a handful of trumps, like for example the casting of no less than Klaus Kinski in the role of Edgar Allan Poe, but in general this original is vastly superior. \\"Castle of Blood\\" literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout. This truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances. Watch it late at night, preferably alone and in a candle lit room, and you'll get an idea about the true definition of horror. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is undoubtedly positive.

To assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we should identify if the claim made in the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise.

According to the premise, exaggeration occurs in the first subject while the second subject is ignored.

As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal.

They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. In August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like \\"tropical prog\\" and \\"like the dream of an eagle dying\\". The band have described the album as being \\"a lot less funk\\" than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor. The album's title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil's theory of singularity. The band's frontman, Yannis Philippakis, has professed a longtime interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever. On 1 March 2010, the promotional single \\"Spanish Sahara\\" was first played on Zane Lowe's show Radio 1. The Foals' website was updated that night with the video for the track, directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma, and on 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was launched. There puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, with a password entry for Foals' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single \\"This Orient\\" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. \\"Spanish Sahara\\" was featured in trailers for season seven of Entourage, season four of Skins and Outcasts. It was also used in the soundtrack of the second season of the E4 drama Misfits. It was released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra. In 2015, it was used by French studio Dontnod Entertainment in the game Life Is Strange as the music for one of its final endings. The album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize. In an interview with online magazine Coup de Main, Jimmy Smith said how the band members live together on and off the road - heading to Australia to record demos for their next album together. \\"It's just like touring with your family, it's nice\\".

The baby with a wound could not calm down after taking the medicine because the medicine was bitter. The baby's mother, Jessica, held her infant close, rocking him gently in an attempt to alleviate his evident distress. Despite her efforts, little Tommy continued to cry, the bitter aftertaste of the medicine still present within his tiny mouth and making him uncomfortable. Jessica sighed, feeling a wave of concern wash over her. She shared a worried glance with her husband, Mark, who stood close by. \\"We need to do something to make him feel better,\\" Mark suggested with a tone of uncertainty lacing his words. \\"Maybe we should give him some water to clear his taste buds?\\" Nodding in agreement, Jessica asked, \\"Can you please warm up some water for him while I try to comfort him?\\" As Mark went to heat some water, Jessica paced around the room, softly singing a lullaby to soothe their child. But Tommy’s wails continued. (2) Unbeknownst to both parents, the wound was also bitter, causing Tommy pain and discomfort despite the medicine that was supposed to help. The cut was tender and throbbing, with redness surrounding the area. The medicine's bitterness masked the foul taste of the infection burgeoning within Tommy's wound, which only served to further his distress. Upon return, Mark handed over a bottle of warm water to Jessica, who gave it to Tommy to drink. The baby eagerly drank the water, and as the bitter taste in his mouth subsided, his cries began to quiet down slightly. However, his pained whimpers persisted, suggesting that the problem went beyond the bitterness of the medicine. Jessica, noticing Tommy's continued discomfort, gently inspected the wound. The redness and slight swelling alarmed her, prompting her to make a decision. \\"Mark, I think we should take him to the doctor. His wound doesn't seem to be healing well.\\" Concern etched on Mark's face, and he nodded, quickly grabbing their things to prepare for a trip to the clinic. At the doctor's office, they explained the situation to the pediatrician, who examined Tommy's wound carefully before delivering the news. \\"Based on my observation, it appears that the wound has become infected. That's likely why he's still in pain despite the medicine.\\" The pediatrician prescribed a new medication, one that would target the infection directly and alleviate Tommy's pain. Jessica and Mark wasted no time in getting the medicine, eager to see their little one finally find relief. As they administered the new medication, Tommy's cries began to fade, and his parents witnessed a gradual return to his usual cheerful demeanor. Understanding the importance of proper wound care, Jessica and Mark were more attentive and vigilant in Tommy's healing process. They made sure to keep the wound clean and dry and provided Tommy with a comfortable environment for a full recovery. Through their care and dedication, and with the support of the pediatrician, Tommy healed quickly, his once raw wound replaced by a faint scar, which in time would become an indiscernible mark on the baby's otherwise unblemished skin.

PUBLISHED:. 20:01 EST, 17 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 08:21 EST, 18 May 2013. Amanda Knox has spoken out against the 'bad vibes' the notorious photo of her kissing former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito created in the days following the death of her housemate Mereditch Kercher. The image was taken as police searched the flat that she had shared with the British university student, who was found with 47 wounds, including a fatal slash across her throat, at their Perugia home in November 2007. Sollecito had been dating Knox in Italy for just one week when the couple came under investigation for her murder. Scroll down for video. The moment that Miss Knox said created 'bad vibes' for her and her boyfriend, whose sex life and drug habits made headlines throughout their trial. She went on to serve four years for. her murder before being acquitted in an appeals court in. 2011 due to insufficient evidence. Then two months ago, Italy’s highest court overturned that decision and ordered a new trial to begin within the next year - raising the prospect that she could be jailed once more. Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found. all over the crime scene, is currently serving a 16-year prison sentence for the murder. Knox, 25, said told The Times that the infamous kiss - caught on camera by the press - created 'bad vibes' for her. She said: 'That video [outside the house] was cut. and repeated so that all you see is a loop of me and Raffaele kissing. over and over again.' The photograph was held up as proof of her alleged sinister sexual nature. In. fact, Knox has revealed that the kiss. was an act of comfort in the face of fear and uncertainty. She said: 'I just felt incredibly lost and I was. sad and I was trying to understand, and Raffaele kissed me to console me. because our language barrier prevented us from really being able to. console each other with words.' Amanda Knox and her then-boyfirend Raffaele Sollecito were pictured kissing outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in Perugia, Italy. Miss Knox is on a media tour to promote her memoir Waiting to be Heard. She spoke to the Times about the public perception of her as a sinister woman. Amanda Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito has released his own memoir of his experience in jail. Italian prosecutors accused Sollecito and Knox of killing Kercher in a sexual escapade that went awry. Knox's behaviour during the police search, in which she didn't cry and was said to hug and kiss her boyfriend, was pursued by the media as a reason to suspect the 20-year-old of murder. Knox's memoir, Waiting to be Heard, has not been published in the UK but has reignited a media storm around the Kercher case. Knox received a grilling from various U.S. media outlets following the release of the book on April 30. Earlier this month she told CNN's Chris Cuomo that despite her characterization in the Italian media as a sexual deviant, she has not experimented with any sort of sex games. Knox was adamant as she told Cuomo: 'I've never taken part in an orgy - ever.' She said she was shocked during the trial, when lawyers for the prosecution were calling her a 'whore' and a 'deviant.' She says that Italian prosecutors made up allegations that she was a sex and drug-crazed party girl to bolster their case. Knox said that her book is aimed at debunking those criticisms. She said: 'In the book I talk about all my sexual experiences... I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip.' Knox added: 'No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, no witnesses have ever come out saying things like that.' She also told Cuomo that now that she's home in Washington, she doesn't go to parties - and no longer smokes cannabis.

Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered a key element of integrated pest management.

These insects are known for their ability to break down and consume wood, making them a major threat to buildings, especially those made primarily of wooden materials. Termites feed on cellulose, which is found in plant material such as wood, paper, and even certain types of plastic. As they consume the wood in structures, they weaken the overall integrity of the building, leading to potential collapse or expensive repairs. Due to the significant damage they can cause, termites are considered to be a highly destructive pest in many parts of the world, and effective control methods are crucial for preventing their impact on architectural structures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Terry was writing a paper but it took her longer on paper than it did on the computer because she worked slower on the","completion":"Terry was writing a paper, but it took her longer on paper than it did on the computer because she worked slower on the paper. One of the primary reasons behind this delay was that writing on paper often requires more time and effort as compared to typing on a computer. The cognitive processes involved, along with the physical act of writing, can slow down the pace at which one can express their thoughts and ideas on paper. Typing on a computer enables Terry to leverage the benefits of word processing software, such as automatic spell check, grammar suggestions, and formatting tools. These features not only enhance the accuracy and quality of her work but also allow for swift adjustments and revisions. As a result, she can focus more on the content and flow of her paper rather than being concerned about making errors or perfecting the presentation. In addition to the software features, writing on a computer offers Terry the advantage of having ready access to online resources. She can seamlessly conduct research, verify facts, and look up definitions without having to reference physical books or switch between tasks. This streamlined process undoubtedly saves time and contributes to better productivity. Working on a computer also provides an ergonomic advantage to Terry. The process of typing is generally faster and more comfortable than handwriting, especially over extended periods. With the correct posture and positioning of equipment, it can reduce the strain on the hands and wrists often experienced by those who rely on handwriting. Moreover, writing on paper for extended durations may lead to smudging, inconsistent lettering, or the need to sharpen or replace writing instruments, further slowing down the writing process. Lastly, writing on a computer can facilitate collaboration and sharing of work. If Terry had to collaborate with her peers for a group paper or seek feedback from her instructor, working on a computer would make it more accessible, as her document can be easily shared through email or cloud-based services. In contrast, a handwritten paper would need to be physically handed over or scanned and converted into a digital format before sharing, adding extra steps and time to the process. In conclusion, Terry worked slower on the paper because of the time-consuming nature of handwriting, lack of efficient tools, and difficulties associated with sharing and revising work. By using a computer, she can take advantage of productivity-enhancing features, ergonomics, and collaboration opportunities to complete her paper more quickly and efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Both questions essentially ask the same thing: \\"Why shouldn't an individual commit suicide?\\" Though the phrasing is slightly different, the underlying query aims at understanding the reasons not to engage in the act of taking one's own life. By addressing the topic with the assumption that you need reasons not to pursue suicide, this response will provide various perspectives on why it is usually considered an unfavorable action. 1. Irreversibility: Taking your own life is a permanent decision. Unlike some decisions you can make in life, there is no going back from it. If you later realize that the reasons for feeling hopeless were temporary issues that could have been resolved or mitigated, there is no way to reverse the decision. There is a possibility that the things that trouble you now may appear less significant in the future. 2. Enduring impact on loved ones: A major reason not to commit suicide is the devastation and pain it brings upon family and friends. Those who take their own life leave behind a void for their loved ones that may never be filled, causing immense grief, and potentially emotional and psychological turmoil among those you leave behind. 3. The potential for change: Life is never static; it is always changing. Current hardships may seem insurmountable, but they can also change over time, leading to potential solutions and a better quality of life. Successfully navigating through those challenges can provide invaluable personal growth and make you more resilient in the long run. 4. The possibility for professional help: Mental health professionals are extensively trained to help individuals suffering from thoughts of suicide. They can offer support, guidance, and strategies for coping with an intense emotional state and the potential underlying mental health issues that may contribute to such feelings. 5. Support networks: Besides professional help, there are numerous resources available, including crisis hotlines, support groups, friends, and family members willing to listen and help you navigate through your difficulties. It is crucial that you communicate your feelings to others as they may provide additional perspectives or support to help mitigate your distress. 6. Personal reasons: There might be specific reasons unique to you why suicide shouldn't be considered. For example, perhaps you have dreams and aspirations that you still want to pursue or responsibilities that you want to fulfill. 7. Unpredictability of life: Life is full of surprises, and the possibility for positive change might be just around the corner. Sometimes, the most rewarding outcomes arise from the most unexpected circumstances. By choosing suicide, you deny yourself any chance of experiencing these positive changes and discoveries. In conclusion, while both questions you mentioned explore the same underlying idea, several reasons should be considered when questioning the decision of committing suicide. These reasons include the decision's permanence, its impact on others, the potential for help through professional intervention, the support available in your life, the unpredictability of positive change, and personal reasons that make life worth living. Reaching out to others and seeking assistance in times of distress can help reveal potential alternatives to suicide and demonstrate that help is available for those struggling with such thoughts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Getting some space from your parent will help you feel confident enough to stand up for yourself as an adult. Even if you don't want to cut off contact with your parent, reduce your communication and visits for a while. OPTIONS: a). Try using a telephone or email that is secure and private. This will allow you to avoid running into your parent.; b). See how you feel when your parent has a less prominent role in your life. Often people in toxic environments don't realize how dysfunctional the people around them are.; c). Write a letter to a trusted friend or take some time for yourself. This may not seem like much, but it will help clear up any unspoken messages that you are approaching the situation from your parent.; d). Avoid making other people accountable for what your parent did. For example, try to limit what time you go out to eat and give yourself enough time to seek support from friends.;","completion":"b). Once you have successfully distanced yourself from your toxic parent, it is crucial to assess how you feel with a less prominent presence of your parent in your life. Often, individuals who have lived in toxic environments become accustomed to the dysfunction and may not even recognize that their parent's behavior is harmful. This self-assessment can help you gain perspective and clarity on the situation, allowing you to better understand the impact your parent's toxicity has on your mental and emotional well-being. During this period of distance, spend time reflecting on the following aspects: 1. Your emotional state: Take note of any changes in your moods, emotions, or mental health. Are you experiencing more happiness, less stress or anxiety, and overall emotional stability? If so, this might be an indication that your parent's presence has been negatively affecting you. 2. Your relationships with others: Observe how your interactions with friends, family, and colleagues have been impacted by your parent's reduced presence. Are your relationships improving, and are you better able to form deep connections with others? Recognizing how your parent may have hindered or influenced your other relationships can help you develop healthier relationships in the future. 3. Your self-esteem and self-worth: Assess whether your confidence and self-worth have improved since distancing yourself from your toxic parent. It is common for toxic parents to harm their children's self-esteem, leading them to doubt their worth and abilities. Gaining distance can often provide clarity and help rebuild your self-esteem. 4. Your personal growth and development: With the reduced influence of your toxic parent, evaluate if you have experienced any personal growth. Have you been able to make progress towards your goals, hobbies, or career aspirations? If you have experienced growth, it may be a sign that your parent's presence has been holding you back. 5. Boundaries and self-care: Reflect on your ability to set appropriate boundaries and prioritize self-care since distancing yourself from your toxic parent. If you find that you are better able to establish boundaries and practice self-care, it is an indication that you have gained a healthier outlook on your relationship with your parent. After conducting this self-assessment, you may realize that your life has improved significantly with your parent's reduced presence. This newfound understanding can help you navigate your relationship with your toxic parent moving forward, deciding whether to maintain the distance or take steps to re-establish contact under healthier terms. Remember, it is essential to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being and seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional when needed. By continuing to distance yourself from your toxic parent and focusing on your personal growth, you will be better equipped to build a healthier and happier life for yourself."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Although police believe that Marc Pych was the only person in the car at the time of the accident, they continue to search the canal for additional passengers. This is due to an initial witness report claiming that two or three people were inside the vehicle when it crashed. A parking attendant had reported the car speeding out of the parking lot and hitting the water before quickly sinking. The accident is currently being investigated as a tragic and unforeseen event rather than an intentional act. The circumstances leading to this heartbreaking tragedy have left Marc Pych's family and friends searching for answers as they mourn the loss of a promising young life cut short on the first day of the new year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The review contains several criticisms and displeasures experienced by the reviewer during their visit to Taiwan Food EXPRESS. Firstly, the reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with not receiving a larger water cup, as they were only given a 6 oz Styrofoam cup. This aspect of the experience contributes to an overall sentiment of disappointment and inconvenience. Secondly, the lengthy waiting time of over 20 minutes for their lunch orders of orange chicken adds to the negative sentiment of the review. The reviewer seems to be frustrated with the delay in service, as it likely affected their overall dining experience. Moreover, the reviewer is unhappy with the taste of the orange chicken, comparing it to \\"liking (licking) orange peels.\\" This is another significant point of dissatisfaction, as the taste of the meal did not meet their expectations and was unsatisfactory. Lastly, the reviewer expresses discontent with their bill, possibly indicating that they found the overall service and quality of food not worth the price they paid. This final point reinforces the negative sentiment conveyed throughout the review.

The photograph has gained significant attention, with the Drudge Report featuring it prominently and conservative bloggers already stating their opinions on the subject. A blogger at Power Line criticized Obama's gesture, suggesting that it symbolizes the essence of his foreign policy approach. The author goes on to argue that Obama's actions send a message that the United States is now content to prostrate itself before the rest of the world, including both monarchies and oppressive regimes. This incident is likely to spark debates and discussions regarding diplomacy, cultural respect, and the perception of American values in the international political sphere.

Summarize: The residential development on the Thames riverfront enveloping Battersea Power Station was originally meant to have 686 affordable homes. But Wandsworth Council allowed this to be reduced by 40% last month to 386. It means just 9% of the homes built will be classed as affordable. Properties prices at the site start at about £460,000 for a studio flat, rising to £1.9m for a three-bedroom flat. Nearly 90% of the 1,661 marketed homes have been sold already. When finished the development will comprise more than 4,200 properties. Most of the affordable homes being built will be available to rent at 40% of market rental values. Mr Khan said: \\"When Wandsworth Council waved through the developer's request to slash affordable housing at Battersea Power Station, I made very clear their decision was letting Londoners down.\\" City Hall said it had no power to prevent the cut in the number of affordable homes being built at the development as the change was made through a deed of variation, which allowed property developers SP Setia and Battersea Power Station Development Company to make changes to the development with approval from Wandsworth Council. Following the decision on 22 June the developers released a statement which said: \\"Battersea Power Station is determined to deliver 15% affordable homes, equating to 636 homes, and the team is working very hard to make that happen. \\"We understand that asking for flexibility on when the affordable homes are delivered across this 15-year project is not straightforward, but our priority is to make good on the trust people have placed in us by starting on the first 386 affordable homes this year, which is three years earlier than the requirement in the original planning consent.\\" The firm added it would be delivering the 15% affordable homes out of all those that \\"currently have detailed planning consent\\", three years earlier than expected. But Mr Khan said the council appeared to \\"have had the wool pulled over their eyes\\". He referred to a viability study, which showed development of the site would yield a profit of £1.8bn to a company willing to take it on. But Wandsworth Council disputed the figures, claiming the viability study was carried out in 2008 and was out of date. Since then the upper end of the London property market had stalled and sterling had fallen by 20% in the wake of the Brexit vote, adding to construction costs and making it highly unlikely that SP Setia could achieve profits that high, the council said. Yet average house prices in London rose nearly 40% between April 2008 and April 2017, according to official data, from £294,346 to £482 779. City Hall said it asked Wandsworth Council for the viability information when it first learned about the developer's request to cut affordable housing at the site. Mr Khan said: \\"The council failed to provide us with this information before deciding to send the application to planning committee for decision. \\"I urgently wrote to the committee urging them to defer the decision until my recently-appointed expert viability team had challenged the numbers, but my concerns fell on deaf ears and Wandsworth waved this shameful decision through. \\"Londoners will therefore be rightly suspicious of the speed in which Wandsworth Council rushed through the decision.\\" Summary:","completion":"The proposed residential development at Battersea Power Station on London's Thames riverfront, originally set to include 686 affordable homes, has had this number cut by 40% to 386 after Wandsworth Council approved the change.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process that eventually leads to erosion through plant-induced rock breakdown is the colonization of a rock surface by pioneering plant species. In this step, various environmental factors and biological processes contribute to the establishment of the plant roots in the rock surface, setting the groundwork for the subsequent steps in the sequence. To elaborate further, the initial stage of the process can be broken down into several interconnected sub-processes: 1. Deposition of organic matter and windblown particles: Dust, soil, and organic materials such as lichen or moss fragments can accumulate on rock surfaces over time. This creates a thin layer of substrate on top of the rock, providing the starting point for plants to take hold. 2. Spore germination and seed dispersion: Plant species that are capable of colonizing rocky surfaces often reproduce by spores or seeds, which are carried to the rock surface by wind, water, or animals. When conditions are favorable, such as the presence of moisture and the right temperature, the spores or seeds can germinate and start to grow, anchoring themselves onto the rock surface. 3. Root penetration and anchoring: The emerging plants develop root systems that extend and cling to the rock surface for support and nutrients. Over time, the roots increase in size and extent, gradually penetrating into the rock's crevices and fractures, driven by the plant's natural growth. 4. Microbial activity: In addition to plant roots, microorganisms like bacteria and fungi can also contribute to breaking down the rock surface. These organisms may form symbiotic relationships with the plant roots or exist independently, participating in the processes of breaking down, dissolving, and mobilizing the minerals within the rock. At this point, the initial step of the process has been completed, and the sequence of events described in the question can begin to unfold. As the plant roots grow deeper and expand, they exert mechanical force on the rock, while also releasing organic acids and other compounds that help dissolve the rock's mineral components. This weakens the rock structure, causing it to fracture and break down into smaller pieces. Ultimately, these processes contribute to erosion, as the rock particles are mobilized and transported away by wind, water, or other forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Question: What promise did the president make? === The answer to the above question is","completion":"The president, Donald Trump, made a promise to boost military funding and construct a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The spending bill provides a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. Although the bill also allocates 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 93 miles of the wall at the border, it falls short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the entire project.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Claim: Ransom payments should be criminalised, and payees forced to contact police. What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"Hello there! I'll explain it in a simple way that a five-year-old can understand. Claim: Making ransom payments illegal and making people talk to the police instead. Imagine that someone took your favorite toy and said, \\"I'll give it back if you give me 10 cookies.\\" Ransom is like that, but with money and more serious things. Some people think it's a good idea to make paying those \\"cookie monsters\\" illegal because: 1. If people keep giving cookies (or money), then the \\"cookie monsters\\" will keep doing it. They will think taking toys is an easy way to get cookies. 2. If we tell the police, they can catch the \\"cookie monsters\\" and stop them from taking more toys (or doing bad things). 3. If we don't give \\"cookie monsters\\" cookies (or money), they won't have the resources to continue with theiractivities. 4. When people talk to the police, it helps them learn about different \\"cookie monsters\\" and find better ways to stop them and protect everyone.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.

News article: Why Employers Can Find Black Talent: Where Pipeline Problem Starts For smart companies, talent — and the talent pipeline — is a preoccupation bordering on obsession. But companies looking to diversify their future ranks are going to be facing some serious headwinds, if the ongoing racial divides in the public school system aren’t fixed. In the fall of 2014, the nation’s public school population was, for the first time, “majority-minority,” a phrase that should finally call into question the definition of minority once and for all. And kids of color are not faring as well they should. Since then, schools have made little progress either re-training white teachers or recruiting ones who look more like the populations they serve. (Latino and Asian students are among the fastest growing parts of the population.) It makes a difference. One example: New Department of Ed data confirms that black pre-schoolers are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended than their white counterparts, starting them on a track to failure early. And low expectations persist. Another recent study from Johns Hopkins showed that when evaluating the same black student, white teachers were about 40% less likely to think that the student would finish high school than black teachers. “The vast majority of K-12 teachers are white women, under pressure to provide an orderly classroom,” says Dr. J. Luke Wood, an associate professor and researcher who runs a doctoral program that helps train professionals to lead at the community college level. He is an expert on the issues facing boys and young men in the education system. “It’s important to realize how unprepared teachers are for the complicated lives of boys of color.” Sign up for raceAhead, Fortune’s daily newsletter on race and culture here. Black and brown boys who do stay in school report feeling invisible to teachers and alienated from outdated curricula that doesn’t seem to include their experience. And, the pressure to police the parts of their identities that trigger anxiety in their white teachers, leaves all kids of color feeling conflicted and drained. “It’s important to shift the narrative around to what these kids need,” he says. How an Intern Became One of the Most Powerful Execs at Morgan Stanley Some Black Americans Found Jesse Williams’ Speech Painful. Here’s Why. The issue only gets more extreme as students reach the university level and find teachers who are subject matter experts but who “may never have taken a class in teaching.” Relationships first, pedagogy second, when facing a diverse student body, says Wood. “We have to get to know each other,” he says. “It doesn’t matter how good your lesson plan is, if you can’t relate to your students.” Part of his advocacy and research work is in association with RISE Boys and Men of Color, a 10 million interdisciplinary effort to study and disseminate best practices for improving the lives of black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian boys and men in the U.S. at every level of their lives, from education to workplace. But he says, more data is needed, and stat. “Academia doesn’t value work on black males, for example, and that’s a challenge,” he says. “They tend to do work on white populations.” But he has one proven practice that can be useful to anyone who mentors students, interns or first time employees, immediately: Be intrusive. “Boys and men in this population are reluctant to seek out help or show any weakness at all,” he says. Check in, often. “And if something is important to their success, like meeting with a faculty member or attending an orientation,” don’t assume they’re comfortable enough to join in on their own, he says. “Make it mandatory.” When she’s not writing about the world’s greatest rock star-leader, Ellen McGirt is busy working on Fortune’s raceAhead, a newsletter about race and culture.

These include having few teachers who are from the same racial background, biases and low expectations from white teachers, and an outdated curriculum that fails to include the experiences of minority students. The article also highlights the work of Dr. J. Luke Wood, an expert on the issues faced by young men in the education system, who is associated with the RISE Boys and Men of Color initiative. This initiative aims at studying and disseminating best practices to improve the lives of young men of color in the United States. Wood emphasizes the need for relationships to be the priority with a diverse student body. Additionally, he calls for more research, for academia to invest more in the study of black males, and for mentors to practice intrusive support for better outcomes.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" Question: \\"How big is the fire?\\" Response: \\"40 acres\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Options: a ) 40 , b ) 50 , c ) 60 , d ) 70 , e ) 80","completion":"Step 1: Determine the current amount of copper in the alloy: We know that the alloy weighs 60 ounces and it is 20% copper, so we can calculate the current amount of copper in the alloy: Current copper = 60 ounces * 20% = 60 * 0.2 = 12 ounces Step 2: Set up an equation to find the amount of copper to be added: Let x be the amount of copper that needs to be added to create an alloy that is 60% copper. The final weight of the alloy will be 60 ounces + x ounces. The final copper content should be 60% of the final weight. Equation: (12 ounces + x) / (60 + x) = 0.6 Step 3: Solve for x: First, we can get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by (60+x): 12 + x = 0.6 * (60 + x) Next, we'll distribute the 0.6 on the right side of the equation: 12 + x = 36 + 0.6x Now, we need to isolate x: 0.4x = 24 Finally, we can solve for x: x = 24 / 0.4 x = 60 So, the correct answer is: c ) 60"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He’s known as the Godfather of match-fixing. Brazen Wilson Raj Perumal has revealed that he made around £3million from rigging soccer matches around the world and claims that he would sometimes sit on team benches giving orders to players and coaches. The Singaporean, 49, admits that he probably fixed the outcomes of almost 100 matches in total. Fixer: Singaporean Wilson Maj Perumal, pictured on trial in Rovaniemi, Finland, in 2011, claims that he rigged around 100 football matches and made £3million. He told CNN in his first-ever TV interview: ‘I never really counted, but I think it should be between 80 and 100 football matches. ‘I was on the bench at times, and telling players what to do, giving orders to the coach. It was that easy. There was no policing whatsoever.’ Perumal said that when he was younger he had dreamed of a career in the armed forces. He said: ‘I had my boyhood dreams. I wanted to be a soldier but during my school days I got a criminal record and couldn't really pursue what I wanted to. And then I got attracted to betting when I was about 19-20 years old. ‘I kind of got hooked and I didn't want to lose… so I started fixing local matches.’ He began fixing matches in the late 1980s in Singapore and eventually joined what international police organization Interpol described as 'the world's most notorious match-fixing syndicate'. He boasted that his success rate was about 70 to 80 per cent. Astonishingly, some football associations welcomed him ‘with open arms’, he explained.

Former Fifa match-fixing investigator Terry Steans was shown Perumal’s contacts list by the police and was amazed to see that he had relationships with officials and players from 38 countries – out of a possible total of 209. Perumal added: ‘I have no regrets. It was a phase of my life and I enjoyed it and I traveled around the world. I had a good time.’ For a time he masterminded this international enterprise - thought to have generated hundreds of millions in fraudulent winnings for crime organisations in the Far East - from a one-bed flat in Wembley, London. Then he was jailed for match-fixing in Finland in 2011. He was sentenced to two years but served a year, before being handed over to authorities in Hungary who were also investigating football’s betting scams. Perumal believes police were tipped off by others inside his organisation and has since exposed some details to media outlets and presumably to police. The Finnish scandal surrounded the club Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS) in the northern city of Rovaniemi. Perumal and nine RoPS players were convicted of match-fixing having taken bribes of up to £33,000 each. Before the Finnish venture, Perumal is alleged to have fixed matches in Africa, the Middle East and Central America. He is reported to have been behind the scandal of the Zimbabwe national team playing games in Asia in 2007 and 2009, which culminated in 98 Zimbabwean footballers and two coaches being suspended in 2012. And he is ensnared in the huge Europol investigation revealed in 2013, which involves club officials, referees and players and concerns 380 matches in 15 different countries between 2011 and 2013. Another incident was the international played between Togo and Bahrain in September 2011, when Togo were beaten 3-0 though it later emerged that they were not the real Togo team. Perumal arrived in London early in 2011, having skipped bail in Singapore, where he faced a charge of hitting a police officer with his car. He lived among Wembley’s Sri Lankan community and went by the name of Rajamohan Chelliah until the Finnish police swooped in the Arctic and the web started to unravel. He says that he has gambled away the fortune he made from match-fixing. Perumal now helps police combat match-fixing and has published an auto-biography called Kelong Kings.

Process: - A type of coal must be chosen before the heating can start - The coal is broken down to a smaller material - The coal particles mix with hot air and move in to a boiler - Water in the boiler is pumped and produces steam with the coal - Steam powers turbine blades, which magnetically charge wire coals - The water returns back in to its chamber and the process is repeated - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The heat is off happens, how will it affect MORE heat for the house. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If the heat is turned off, it will directly affect the process involved in producing more heat for the house using coal. Here's a breakdown of the impact on each step: 1. Coal selection: This step can still be carried out; however, since the heat is turned off, no immediate heating can take place. 2. Coal breakdown: There's no change in this step as it doesn't involve heating. 3. Coal particles mixing with hot air and moving into a boiler: Since the heat is off, the air will not be hot enough, and as a result, coal particles will not mix efficiently. This step is directly impacted, causing a hindrance in the heat production process. 4. Steam production in the boiler: Due to the absence of heat, water in the boiler will not reach the appropriate temperature to produce steam. It will lead to a halt in the process. 5. Steam powering turbine blades: Without steam, turbine blades will not function effectively, affecting the magnetic charge of wire coils. This step is directly impacted, further disrupting the heat generation process. 6. Water returns to its chamber: Since no steam is being produced, this part of the process is indirectly impacted as there's no water to be returned to the chamber. In conclusion, the perturbation of turning the heat off directly affects the process of producing more heat for the house. It disrupts the crucial steps of heating the coal, steam production, and thus the functioning of turbine blades, which ultimately leads to an insufficient generation of heat."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Available options: *no. *yes.","completion":"*yes. Clarke pushed funding for an \\"all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center.\\" This means he wanted a center that would gather and analyze information about terrorist financing from various sources.

After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village. Which village is situated farther from sea lever? Answer:","completion":"Steep village is situated farther from sea level. It is located at an altitude of 8,500 feet (2,590 meters) above sea level, whereas Berg village is situated at a lower altitude of 3,000 feet (914 meters) above sea level. This is why visitors feel winded and not as good when they reach Steep village, as the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes, making it harder for people to breathe and adjust."},{"prompt":"I’m here in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a team meetup. Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Each state has residency requirements that you must meet if you want to file for divorce in that state. Typically, you must have lived in the state for at least 6 months to a year. Some states require a longer period of residency. However, there are often exceptions made. For example, if the reason for the divorce happened in that state, you may be able to file for divorce regardless of how long you’ve lived there. You may not be able to file for a no-fault divorce in that situation. If you’re concerned that you haven’t lived in a state long enough to file for divorce there, talk to an attorney about it. The specific court where you file your divorce typically will be the one in the county where you and your spouse live. If you and your spouse live in different counties, you may need to file in the county where your spouse lives. Family law attorneys always provide a free initial consultation. Even if you don’t think you can afford an attorney, it’s still worth at least talking to someone about your case. They may be able to help you in a limited capacity for a reduced rate. Many family attorneys also have sliding fee scales based on your income. This could help you afford an attorney. Legal aid offices sometimes provide assistance for divorces free of charge. However, due to the demand for their services, they typically don’t take divorce cases unless abuse is involved. Family courts in most states have forms you can fill out if you want to file for divorce without hiring an attorney. Typically you can download these forms from the website for your state's court system. If you download forms from the state website, check with your local courthouse and make sure there aren't any additional forms you should fill out. Some local courts have their own forms, such as a particular cover sheet, that must be included. Typically, there will be different forms if you and your spouse have children or if you own a house together. Make sure you've picked the right forms. If you need help, the clerk's office of your local family law court can tell you which forms you need based on your circumstances. Some states, such as Massachusetts, require you and your spouse to come to a preliminary agreement on child custody, child support, and how you will divide your property before you can file for divorce. This agreement can be a temporary agreement between you and your spouse or one that you intend to make part of the final divorce judgment. If a separation agreement is required, the state court website will have information and forms for you to use. At a minimum, the separation agreement will govern relations between you and your spouse until your divorce is finalized. If you and your spouse have problems communicating or there has been a history of abuse, you may want to use mediation services or hire an attorney. Through the divorce petition, you provide the court with information about yourself, your spouse, and your marriage. The petition is a document that formally asks the court to declare a legal end to your marriage. If you downloaded the forms online, you can type your information directly into the form. If you're working with paper forms you can write your answers. Print clearly and neatly using black ink. To complete the divorce petition, you will have to provide information about your spouse, including their full legal name, date of birth, and current residence. If you don't have all of this information and don't know how to get it, talk to an attorney. After you've filled out the petition and other forms, read over them carefully and make sure all the information is correct. If you typed your information in the form, check for typos. Before you sign and date the forms, check if there is a notary block below the place where you're supposed to sign. If there is, don't sign your forms until you're in the presence of a notary. Not all states require you to sign your forms in the presence of a notary. However, many states do require this if you are not represented by an attorney. When you go to the notary, you will need a valid, government-issued photo ID so the notary can validate your identity. The notary will not read your forms – their only job is to certify that you are the person who signed the documents and that you did so of your own free will. At a minimum, you will need an official copy of your original wedding certificate to accompany your divorce petition. Some states may require other documents, such as birth certificates for any children you and your spouse have. If you don't have a copy of your wedding certificate, you can order one from the state vital records office of the state where you were married. If you were married in a different country, such as on a destination wedding, you would need a wedding certificate from the state where you registered as a married couple after you returned to the US. Wedding certificates for most states can be ordered online through the VitalChek website at https://www.vitalchek.com/marriage-records. Copies typically cost less than 20. It may take up to 2 weeks for you to get your copy in the mail, so plan accordingly. Through a temporary order, the judge can require your spouse to pay you child support or spousal support, or order them to pay certain bills while your divorce is pending. If there has been abuse or you are concerned for your safety, you can also get a temporary restraining order against your spouse. Temporary orders only last until the divorce is finalized. If you want the same arrangements to continue after the divorce, those details must be included in your final divorce decree. Once you've completed all the necessary forms, make at least 2 copies of the completed forms. Take the copies and the originals to the court clerk of the court that will hear your divorce. The clerk will stamp all of your documents filed, then give the 2 copies back to you. One of those copies is for your records. The other must be delivered to your spouse. The fees to file a divorce case vary greatly among states, but they're typically between 200 and 500. If you can't afford the fees, you can apply for a fee waiver. Typically, you have to show extremely low income to qualify. If you are already receiving government benefits, such as SNAP or TANF, you may automatically qualify. Most court clerks accept a check or money order as payment for fees. Many accept cash, and some accept major credit or debit cards. It's a good idea to call ahead and find out what methods of payment are accepted so you can be prepared. If you want to apply for a waiver, bring information with you about your income and any property you own, such as a house. You will need this information to complete your application. You should also be ready to appear before the judge, as they may call you back to discuss your application. Your spouse must have legal notice that you've filed for divorce. By using the \\"service\\" process, you have proof that they were aware of the case. If your spouse fails to respond to your petition or show up in court, you'll need to show the judge proof that they knew about it. If you and your spouse are on amicable terms, you can mail the papers using certified mail with return receipt requested. Keep the green card you get back in the mail with your copy of the divorce papers. This is your proof of service. You may also have to fill out a proof of service form and file it with the clerk. In some states, only attorneys can complete service this way. You can have anyone over the age of 18 take the papers to your spouse in person. They will fill out a proof of service form for you to file with the clerk. This option is free. You can also have a sheriff's deputy serve the papers on your spouse. This is a good option if you and your spouse are on contentious terms or if you have safety concerns. This option typically costs around 30. If you were granted a fee waiver, service by a sheriff's deputy is typically also free. There are also private process serving companies you can use. These companies are good at hunting down people, so if you suspect your spouse will try to avoid service, you may want to go this route. Prices vary widely by company and how long it takes them to complete service.","completion":"This article talks about the steps and requirements for filing a divorce in different states, including residency rules, getting legal help, preparing and filing necessary documents, and notifying your spouse about the divorce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inside GOP, the question is where do you stand on Common Core? An opponent protests Common Core State Standards in Indianapolis. Indiana was the first state to back out of the national education standard. (AP) Common Core has emerged as the newest Republican litmus test for gauging candidates’ conservative bona fides, and experts say the controversial national education standard will help shape elections from school boards to the White House for the foreseeable future. Whether prompted by pressure from grassroots groups and well-funded political action committees, or simply by a realization of what is involved in the sweeping K-12 reform, Common Core has become a hot button issue within the GOP. Several Republican governors, including some rumored to be considering 2016 White House runs, have turned against the plan and critics have coined a loaded term for it that lays bare the political divide: “ObamaCore.” “The center of gravity on the right has clearly shifted in recent months,” said Frederick Hess, of the American Enterprise Institute. “The Common Core is now like comprehensive immigration reform: there are respected leaders who endorse it, but they’re clearly crosswise with mainstream conservative sentiment.” - Emmett McGroarty, the American Principles Project The issue's prominence is expected to rise as Common Core is widely implemented next fall, and as fellow Republicans at the local, state and federal levels battle it out in primaries. Experts predict it will become a potent issue in November's midterm elections, and eventually, in 2016. Earlier this week, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a onetime backer of Common Core, issued an executive order designed to block its implementation in the Bayou State. Although Louisiana was one of 45 states that initially adopted the plan, Jindal has since turned against it, as criticism mounted around the nation. The move by the high-profile Jindal was seen by many as a tipping point in the mainly conservative battle against Common Core. Political Action Committees are pouring money into state legislative races in an effort to bounce lawmakers who back the national standard. “The ultimate goal of Common Core is to have every school district follow the same national standards,” reads a statement from the Alabama Foundation for Limited Government’s website, which poured 200,000 into Stop Common Core, a PAC that has spent nearly 1 million on ads attacking proponents. “This is a failed educational approach that will undermine educational quality and choice.\\" PACS, nonprofits and Facebook pages with names like\\"Stop Common Core in New York,\\" \\"American Against Common Core,\\" and \\"Repeal Common Core Now\\" have exploded in recent months, and politicians who trust their futures to polls and focus groups cannot ignore the groundswell. \\"Common Core has become a flashpoint election issue,\\" said Emmett McGroarty, education director at the American Principles Project.\\"Voters are increasingly realizing that the Common Core is of poor quality and locks children into an inferior education. \\"Candidates are beginning to understand that they must demonstrate courage and stand up against the federal government and special interests like the Chamber of Commerce,\\" he added. The Common Core State Standards Initiative was originally commissioned by the National Governors Association in 2009 to clearly outline what students are expected to learn and know by each grade level. The idea was to ensure that all states established a baseline of math and language standards, to be assessed by standardized testing throughout students’ K-12 years. It has since been wholly embraced by the Obama administration’s Department of education, though several prominent Republicans, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, are vocal supporters. The standards and their wide-scale adoption flew under the radar until the Obama administration began offering federal money to states that began to implement them. While Common Core advocates insist that it provides assessment, and not curriculum, critics say the lesson plans will necessarily track the tests. Indeed, companies that generate curriculum have rushed to brand their text and workbooks as “Common Core-aligned.” The program is to begin implementation in most states next year, but school districts around the nation have already phased in lessons in anticipation of the tests. That, in turn, has riled parents who went from having a vague idea at best of Common Core to experiencing it first hand at kitchen tables. The web has exploded with testaments from parents blasting curriculum changes they blame on Common Core. The tests’ emphasis on nonfiction will result in kids no longer reading the classics, they say. Social and political agendas are creeping into lessons taught to school kids, claim critics. And new methods of teaching mathematics, many rooted in the controversial Everyday Mathematics curriculum devised more than a decade ago at the University of Chicago, have caused frustration for parents who know how to help their children get the right answer, but not how to do it the right way. “My kids used to love math,” comic Louis C.K. tweeted in April. “Now it makes them cry. Thanks standardized testing and common core!” In addition to angering parents, Common Core has drawn the ire of conservatives who believe it cedes local and parental control of what kids are taught to Washington, a line of argument that puts Common Core’s Republican backers on the defensive. Jindal's bid to strike down Common Core was an indirect maneuver using the state’s contract bidding rules to pull Louisiana out of the reform. Other states including Indiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma have backed out of the program with the support of both the executive and legislative branches. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill earlier this month to repeal the Common Core education standards, getting rid of the new guidelines for math and English scheduled to go into effect in Oklahoma schools in the upcoming school year. That bill, overwhelmingly passed in the House and Senate on the final day of the 2014 session, requires the state to return to old standards in place before 2010 and directs new ones to be developed by 2016. It requires all new standards and revisions to be subject to legislative review. Also earlier this month, another Republican governor, Nikki Haley, of South Carolina, signed a bill requiring the state to adopt new standards to replace Common Core by the 2015-16 school year. In March, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed legislation making his state the first in the nation to pull out of the controversial K-12 guidelines. Four states, Nebraska, Texas, Virginia and Arkansas, never signed on, and Minnesota only agreed to partial participation. Nine more states have legislation in some stage of the process that would repeal Common Core participation. “Regardless of whether or not these Governors are motivated politically, we are thrilled to see so many states taking bold stands against the federal government by beginning to exit the Common Core,” said Glyn Wright, executive director of The Eagle Forum, a conservative think tank that has been critical of Common Core. “If governors and state legislatures are truly representative of the people, then we certainly expect to see more states exiting Common Core.” Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant hinted this week that he could be the next Republican state executive to move against Common Core. \\"I think Common Core is a failed program, and the United States is beginning to realize that,\\" Bryant said. \\"Governors all across America are realizing states can do it better.\\" But not all red state, Republican governors are turning on the program. Much of the groundwork has been laid and money spent to implement Common Core, and governors such as Tennessee’s Bill Haslam are not wavering. “We’re three years into implementation, and we’re making great progress,” said Haslam spokesman David Smith. “To back up on these higher standards now would be a big mistake for our state.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the division within the GOP on the topic of Common Core, a national education standard in the United States.

Build a movie plot around this: What did George become in one of his dreams? The first American President The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Dreams of the First President Genre: Historical Drama Plot: The young George Woodsman, a brilliant and imaginative 20-year-old man from present-day Virginia, is captivated by the stories of George Washington and his role in founding the United States. Vulnerable to whimsical dreams and passionate about history, George dreams of becoming the nation's first President himself. Unbeknownst to him, powerful forces in the universe grant him an extraordinary opportunity that would see his dream become more than just fantasy. The story begins in a small town in Virginia, where George Woodsman helps his father at their family bookstore that houses a vast collection of history books, novels and family heirlooms. He spends his days endlessly reading about George Washington, becoming so entranced by the founding father that he begins to imagine himself in that role, leading a fledgling nation. One night, while George is asleep with Washington's memoirs sharing his bed, he finds himself suddenly transported to the 18th century in a bewildering turn of events. The cosmic forces send George on a mission, switching places with George Washington, the young colonial soldier who would eventually become the first President. George Woodsman quickly realizes that he must lead America through the Revolutionary War and help create the Constitution in order to guide the fragile nation towards its future. As George Woodsman navigates through this alternate reality, he must grapple with his newfound place in history. He faces political rivalry and complicated moral battles with powerful leaders of the era, including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams. Unsure whether his actions in this world are altering the course of history, George must weigh each decision carefully while struggling to maintain the image of the legendary leader he so admired. Throughout the film, George forms a personal connection to Martha Washington, the woman who would have been the real George Washington's wife. Initially introduced as a strong-willed woman devoted to her husband, Martha and George Woodsman's hearts inevitably intertwine, and together they endure the perennial challenges of a divided country on the brink of collapse. Upon successfully leading the nation to victory, ratifying the Constitution and establishing the newly formed United States, George Woodsman is ready to take the reins as its very first President. However, the cosmic forces that brought him to the 18th century remind him that an unstable balance in the universe demands his return to the present day. George must now confront the pain of leaving behind the life and love he built in the past. In the final scenes, George Woodsman tearfully bids Martha Washington farewell, transforming back into his present-day life. He awakens with the realization that the dream was more than a fleeting experience; it has granted him profound wisdom and a newfound love for history. Forever changed by his experiences, George dedicates himself to education and activism, embracing his role as a modern-day crusader for democracy. The story culminates with George founding an organization that educates young people on the importance of civic responsibility and preserving the values his ancestors fought for. Dreams of the First President interweaves fantasy with historical facts to deliver a captivating exploration of personal growth, love, and responsibility. While the film takes viewers on a thrilling journey through America's tumultuous beginnings, it remains grounded in relatable themes of self-discovery and understanding one's place in the world. With its rich narrative, compelling characters, and visionary take on the birth of a nation, Dreams of the First President is an unforgettable tale sure to resonate with audiences everywhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: a ) 0.36 , b ) 3.6 , c ) 360 , d ) 6000 , e ) 36000","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the problem The question is asking to compute the number of anglets in a sixth of a circle. An anglet is defined as 1 percent of 1 degree. Step 2: Conversion of the problem We first need to find out how many degrees are there in a sixth of a circle. A full circle has 360 degrees. Thus a sixth of a circle can be computed as: (1/6) * 360 Step 3: Calculation of degrees in a sixth of a circle To calculate this value, multiply the numerator of the fraction by the number of degrees in a circle: (1 * 360) / 6 = 360 / 6 Step 4: Division Now, divide the product of Step 3 by the denominator of the fraction: 360 / 6 = 60 degrees Step 5: Conversion of degrees to anglets Now we need to convert 60 degrees to anglets, where 1 anglet is defined as 1% of 1 degree. So, for one degree, there are 100 anglets. Thus, for 60 degrees, we have: 60 degrees * 100 anglets/degree Step 6: Multiplication Multiply the number of degrees by the number of anglets per degree to calculate the total number of anglets: 60 * 100 = 6000 anglets Step 7: Final Answer The number of anglets in a sixth of a circle is 6000.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"What was the response to Spanish oppression by a large number of Arawak people?\\" Answer: \\"The Arawak immediately began subjugating the Spanish population\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Available choices: (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(a). no; The answer to the question \\"What was the response to Spanish oppression by a large number of Arawak people?\\" is incorrect.

Article: We are much happier in our new house because it has a large garden, and you know how enthusiastic we both are about gardening. When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch. A few moments later, a lizard ran across a wall, right in front of one of the alarm units.

Given the question: Given the following context: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout.

Translate to English","completion":"The phrase you've presented is in Romanian, and it translates to \\"Consistency is essential here\\" in English. Consistency refers to the notion of performing actions in a stable, predictable, and uniform manner, which can apply to numerous areas in life, such as professional settings, academic settings, personal habits, relationships, and more. Essentially, it's about setting a certain standard or pattern and diligently following it. Being consistent helps to establish routines and build habits, it increases accuracy and productivity, and it also helps to establish and maintain trust in personal and professional relationships. Inconsistencies, on the other hand, can lead to misunderstanding, lack of trust, and overall instability. For example, in a professional setting, if a person performs a task in a different way each time, the results will likely vary, causing issues in terms of balancing workload, predicting outcomes, establishing trust, and so on. The phrase \\"Consistency is essential here\\" might be used to emphasize the critical role of stable and reliable practices in the given context. This might mean adhering to a set of rules, maintaining a particular standard of behavior, or regularly performing certain tasks. For instance, in a manufacturing environment, consistent methods and processes are key to ensuring product quality and safe working conditions. In a customer service role, being consistent might mean delivering the same high level of service to each customer, which helps to build the company's reputation and retain customers. In education, consistency could refer to teaching methods, grading standards, or classroom rules that ensure a fair, productive learning environment. In sum, the translation of the phrase presents a broad conception that can be applied to numerous areas of life and helps to emphasize the importance of maintaining a constant, predictable, and dependable approach, whether it's about carrying out daily tasks, maintaining relationships, managing a team, or running a company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He finagles a transfer back to his old unit. On the bus trip to his new assignment, he meets fellow passenger \\"Stitch\\" Jones (Van Peebles), a flashy wannabe rock musician who borrows money for a meal at a rest stop and then steals his bus ticket, leaving him stranded. When Highway finally arrives at the base, more bad news awaits. His new Operations Officer, Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill), is an Annapolis graduate who transferred over from Supply and has not had \\"the privilege\\" of combat.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the album that peaked at number 8 on the charts? A significant stylistic shift in the Kinks' music became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like \\"A Well Respected Man\\" and \\"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\\", as well as the band's third album, The Kink Kontroversy, on which session musician Nicky Hopkins made his first appearance with the group on keyboards. These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining the Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential \\"chart winner\\" by Billboard magazine.

Review: ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is without a doubt the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. Film starts out with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer/prostitute in a club that caters to American GI's and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they start to see one another on a steady basis. Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door. He hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out. The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her. Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get over everything that Maria has done since he has been locked up. *****SPOILER ALERT***** One day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it. There are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths. Like in all Fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn Germany but as Maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white. The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of Maria. Fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla wasn't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Maria purposely left the gas on. Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad. This is only speculation and if you think I'm wrong please e-mail me. I think she was overly excited by Hermann being home and left it on by accident (Remember her putting on a dress for no reason?). Then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing. Thats the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes its by accident. But I think the reason for Fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate. In his view Maria can't have it both ways. A fascinating film. What is the sentiment of this review?

He soon learns they are in possession of marijuana. In response, he takes them to jail. After they enter the police station, they see a little girl, dead, on the floor and Entragian shoots and kills Peter. Mary is thrown in a jail cell along with a young boy, David Carver, his parents, Ralph and Ellen, and an old man, Tom Billingsley. It's also learned the little girl is the Carver's daughter named Pie. In the meantime, in the police station, David is knelt down and prayed to God, which he's been doing since his best friend Brian was struck by a drunk driver. Meanwhile, Steve Ames is in his truck following famous author Johnny Marinville who is some 50 miles up ahead. Steve soon picks up a young female hitchhiker named Cynthia Smith. Johnny stops in the desert to urinate just as Entragian shows up behind him and puts the same bag of marijuana he got from Peter and Mary in Johnny's motorcycle bag and \\"arrests\\" him. Back in the Police Station, David was asked by his mother Ellen why he kept on praying. David revealed that he prays to God because he made his presence known to him by miraculously saving his friend, Brian from the brink of death. He then recollected that when he and Brian(his friend) were riding a bike, a drunk driver hit Brian. The impact caused Brian to fly in the air and hit his head on a brick wall. Brian suffered severe head trauma and injuries to his face. David immediately began praying to God, offering to sacrifice anything, and to do what ever is asked of him just for his friend (Brian) to be saved. At which point, Brian, who was on the brink of death, miraculously regains consciousness. The doctor at the hospital describes Brian's recovery as \\"miraculous\\".

In flashback, Martin recalls stopping over in Tokyo, where a series of ship disasters catches his attention. When a survivor finally washes up on Odo Island, Martin flies there for the story with Tomo Iwanaga (Frank Iwanaga), a representative of the Japanese security forces and learns of the island inhabitants' belief in a sea monster god known to them as \\"Godzilla\\", which they believe is causing the disasters. Martin returns to the island with Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura), who leads an investigation crew to Odo Island, where radioactive footprints and a Trilobite are discovered. An alarm rings and Martin, the villagers, and Dr. Yamane's crew head to a hill for safety, only to come across Godzilla. Dr. Yamane returns to Tokyo to present his findings and concludes that Godzilla was resurrected by repeated nuclear tests. Martin contacts his old friend, Dr. Daisuke Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), for dinner but refuses due to planned commitments. Emiko (Momoko Kochi), Dr. Yamane's daughter, goes over to Serizawa's to break off her arranged engagement to him, due to her love for Hideo Ogata (Akira Takarada), a salvage ship captain.

Taking that into consideration, the best answer to the question, \\"What will Remy want to do next?\\" would be: A: Implement the idea This answer is the most logical and contextually appropriate choice because Remy has not shown any intent to quit her job or seek a promotion. Instead, she has demonstrated a hardworking attitude and a commitment to assisting her supervisors with their requirements. Implementing the idea aligns with her proactive approach and highlights her desire to contribute actively to the project's success. The other options, B (quit the job) and C (wants a promotion), don't align with the context provided. Quitting the job would suggest a lack of commitment or dissatisfaction, while requesting a promotion would typically come after a successful project completion or consistent contributions rather than immediately after presenting ideas.

See options at the end During the concert the ukulele sounded worse than the guitar because the Pick your answer from: [I] ukulele was out of tune.. [II] guitar was out of tune..","completion":"During the concert, the ukulele sounded worse than the guitar because the ukulele was out of tune. This could have been due to various factors that may have contributed to its poor sound quality compared to the guitar. Firstly, the strings on a ukulele can be made from different materials, typically nylon or fluorocarbon, whereas guitar strings are generally made from steel or a combination of steel and other materials. Over time, the strings on a ukulele may lose their elasticity and tension, resulting in the instrument going out of tune. Moreover, environmental factors such as humidity and temperature can cause the ukulele's wooden body to expand or contract. This may affect the tension and alignment of the strings, thus deteriorating the tuning and overall sound quality. Guitars are also affected by these changes in their environment, but they are generally built with more robust materials and their larger body provides some stability in their tuning, making them less prone to going out of tune. Another aspect to consider is that the ukulele has a shorter scale length compared to the guitar. This means the distance between the frets is shorter, and any small discrepancies in string tension or intonation can have a significant impact on the sound. On the other hand, guitars, with their longer scale length, are generally more accurate with their intonation, which results in a more pleasing sound. Furthermore, the construction of a ukulele can also play a role in the sound it produces. If the ukulele is poorly made, with low-quality materials or improper alignment of the bridge or neck, it can lead to intonation issues and consequently impact the quality of the sound. On the contrary, guitars have more complex structural components, and high-quality guitars are meticulously crafted to ensure the best possible sound. It's important to note that these factors can vary from one instrument to another. During the concert, it's possible that the ukulele player may not have been as diligent in maintaining or tuning their instrument as the guitarist. Proper care, regular tuning, and good technique can greatly improve the sound of a ukulele. It's also possible that the guitarist had better sound equipment or amplification, which could have further contributed to the disparity between the instruments' sound qualities. In conclusion, during the concert, the ukulele sounded worse than the guitar because the ukulele was out of tune. A combination of factors such as string quality, environmental conditions, craftsmanship, and maintenance could have contributed to this difference in sound quality between the two instruments. However, it's essential to remember that with proper care and attention, the ukulele has the potential to produce a beautiful, harmonious sound that can rival the guitar's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He learns that moss roses do best in full sun and need well-draining soil. They also prefer slightly dry conditions. Step 2: Inspect the garden Next, Benjamin visits Randy's garden and inspects the location of the moss roses. He confirms the plants are in an area that receives an adequate amount of sunlight and checks the soil to ensure it’s well-draining. Step 3: Set up a watering schedule Benjamin knows that moss roses have low water requirements, so he decides to set up a watering schedule to avoid overwatering them. He plans to water the plants every few days, depending on the weather conditions. If it rains, he will adjust the schedule. Step 4: Remove weeds and check for pests To maintain the moss roses' overall health, Benjamin decides to regularly inspect the plants for weeds and pests. By removing weeds and addressing any pest issues, he ensures that the roses will have a better chance to grow well during Randy's absence. Step 5: Update Randy To keep Randy informed and assure him that his moss roses are being well taken care of, Benjamin sends him regular updates, including photos of the thriving plants. Through these steps, Benjamin shows his dedication and loyalty as a good friend. Randy returns home to find his moss roses flourishing, and he is grateful to have such a committed friend like Benjamin.

This National Park site: No people (11 pics) High on the flank of a little-known peak, perched in a remote corner of an underutilized national park, it felt as though we were the only ones around in 250 square miles. You can still find spots like this – in fact, plenty of them – at national parks in California and across America. Monday is the 98th anniversary of the formation of the National Park Service. Entrance fees are waived. On Friday evening, we found a campground near a lake. We hiked to a nearby peak with world-class views, without seeing another person or a single piece of litter. This was at Lassen Volcanic National Park, which gets 10 percent of the visitors that Yosemite gets, 400,000 to 4 million. When most people think of national parks in California, they think of Yosemite Valley, the Sherman Tree at Sequoia National Park, the paved Main Park Trail at Muir Woods and a few other spots. With a slight change of perspective – not going to the obvious places – you can transform your experience and perception of what’s available in national parks. That’s what we did Friday. The best way to avoid people in peak season is to venture outside the west-to-east band from the Bay Area to Tahoe/Yosemite. So off we went on Highway 44, east of Red Bluff and beyond past Old Station, with a right turn on a signed dirt road and then 7 miles to the campground and Butte Lake (low, like most). The nearby trailhead is best known as the launch point for the 1.2-mile hike to the top of Cinder Cone, a volcanic oval with a view. A half-mile in, if you turn right instead of left, you grind out a 2,250-foot climb in 3.5 miles to get to the top of flat-topped Prospect Peak. Views emerge below of Butte Lake, Snag Lake, the Fantastic Lava Beds, Cinder Cone and then to the volcanic rim on the horizon crowned by 10,457-foot Lassen Peak.

Goal: pipe Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"It seems that you haven't provided enough information or context about the goal and methods you are considering for achieving this goal. Therefore, I will provide a detailed comparison of some common methods used in piping based on various applications. 1. PVC Pipes: Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes are widely used for household plumbing systems, especially for indoor water distribution. They offer advantages such as low cost, light weight, and easy installation. However, they are not suitable for high-risk electrical systems or high-temperature applications due to their thermal and electrical conductivity limitations. 2. Copper Pipes: Copper piping has a long history of use in plumbing and HVAC systems due to its excellent conductivity, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance. Copper pipes can withstand high temperatures, making them suitable for heating systems and hot water supply. However, they are more expensive than PVC pipes and require professional installation and soldering. 3. Steel Pipes: Steel pipes are popular choices for industrial and large-scale applications. They have good mechanical strength, which makes them capable of withstanding high pressures and temperatures. They are widely used in gas and oil transportation, water supply, and drainage systems. However, steel pipes are susceptible to corrosion, require special anti-corrosion treatments, and are relatively heavier and more expensive compared to PVC pipes. 4. Polyethylene (PE) Pipes: Polyethylene pipes are flexible, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant, making them a suitable choice for water distribution and gas distribution systems. They have low thermal conductivity, are easy to transport and install, and are resistant to chemicals. However, they are not suitable for high-temperature applications or high-pressure systems. 5. Cast Iron Pipes: Cast iron pipes are known for their strength, durability, and ability to withstand heavy loads. They have a long history of use in sewer and drainage systems. However, they are heavy, expensive, and require skilled installation. Additionally, they are prone to internal corrosion and external rust, which can gradually lead to pipe failure. 6. Ductile Iron Pipes: Ductile iron pipes are a modern replacement for traditional cast iron pipes. They have similar strength and durability, but increased flexibility and resistance to third-party damages. They are used mainly for water and sewer infrastructure. However, like cast iron pipes, they are heavy, expensive, and require specialized installation. Considering the above methods, the most reasonable method for accomplishing your goal depends on specific factors such as the application, budget, temperature and pressure requirements, and ease of installation. For residential use, PVC or copper pipes are commonly used, while for industrial applications, steel or ductile iron pipes may be more suitable. In the case of water and gas distribution networks, polyethylene pipes are a popular choice due to their flexibility, corrosion resistance, and ease of installation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles woman whom rapper 50 Cent is accused of kicking in a domestic violence incident is a model and an actress who had a part in a \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" film, her representative told CNN Friday. Daphne Joy, who was born in the Philippines, has a baby by the rapper and is now focusing on safety for the child and herself, said Jim Yeager, a spokesman for the Los Angeles law firm of Meyer, Olson, Lowy & Meyers, which is representing her. The alleged victim, whose name wasn't earlier disclosed by authorities, released her name Friday through Yeager.","completion":"As the story unfolds, Daphne Joy, the model and actress who filed domestic violence charges against rapper 50 Cent, seeks justice and protection for both herself and their child. The incident gains widespread media attention, leading to public scrutiny and discussion about domestic violence within the entertainment industry. Despite the high-profile nature of the case, Daphne remains focused on her safety and that of her child through the legal process. The trial proceeds, and various witnesses are called to testify. Some provide testimony supporting Daphne's claim, while others side with the rapper, causing controversy both inside and outside the courtroom. Amidst the attention, Daphne's representatives tirelessly work to gather evidence that supports her claims of abuse. Meanwhile, 50 Cent's lawyers argue that their client was wrongly accused and that the claims against him are fabrications meant to tarnish his reputation. During the trial, testimonies and evidence pointing to a pattern of abuse emerge, which strengthen Daphne's case. Public opinion sways, with more people becoming empathetic toward her situation, demanding the entertainment industry address the issue of domestic violence and hold accountable those found guilty. Advocacy groups and celebrities voice their support for Daphne, recognizing her courage to come forward and standing against abuse. As the trial concludes, the jury finds 50 Cent guilty of domestic violence charges. He is ordered to undergo therapy and community service, as well as pay both financial compensation and emotional damages to Daphne. The verdict is seen as a small victory for victims of domestic violence everywhere, providing hope and encouragement for taking a stand against abusers, even when faced with the fear of retaliation or public scrutiny. The events surrounding the trial create a lasting impact on both Daphne's and 50 Cent's lives. Daphne, now recognized as a brave advocate against domestic violence, continues her acting and modeling career and, more importantly, focuses on raising her child in a safe and loving environment. She uses her platform to help raise awareness about domestic violence and works with organizations to support survivors and bring attention to the issue. 50 Cent, on the other hand, faces substantial damage to his reputation. Once admired for his musical talent and business acumen, he now struggles to regain the respect of his fans and the music industry. While he complies with the court's orders and undergoes therapy to address his abusive behavior, it remains uncertain whether or not the once-iconic rapper can make a comeback. As the years go by, Daphne continues to be an inspiration to domestic violence survivors, and her child grows up in a supportive and secure home. While the harrowing events of the trial may have left a lasting mark on her, Daphne's strength and determination ultimately helps her persevere and live a fulfilling life. In this story, the ending is a powerful reminder that, in the face of adversity and abuse, seeking justice and standing up for oneself is crucial – no matter how high the stakes or the prominence of the abuser."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I worked there for seven years and learned so many lessons, especially from a fellow waitress Helen who had incredible self-respect and did what she loved--serving people. She made everyone smile and feel good, customers and co-workers alike. Being a waitress changed my life. One of my regular customers was Fred Hasbrook, an electronics salesman. Thanks to the newfound confidence I picked up from Helen, I dreamed of having my own restaurant. But when I called my parents to ask for a loan, they said, \\"We just don't have the money.\\" The next day, I shared my dream with him and said, \\"Fred, I know I can do more if somebody would just have faith in me.\\" He walked over to some of the other diner regulars and the next day handed me checks totaling 50,000--along with a note that I have to this day. It reads, \\"The only collateral on this loan is my trust in your honesty as a person. Good people with a dream should have the opportunity to make that dream come true.\\" I took the checks to Merrill Lynch--the first time I had ever entered a brokerage house--where the money was invested for me. I continued working at the Buttercup, making plans for the restaurant I would open. My investments soured, though, and I lost the money. After great deliberation I decided to apply for a job at Merrill Lynch. Even though I had no experience, I was hired and ended up becoming a pretty good broker. Eventually I paid back Fred and my customers the 50,000, plus 14-percent annual interest. Five years later, I was able to open my own firm.

A father strangled his two young sons in front of his ex-wife before shooting himself dead just days before the couple went to court over their divorce, police said. Isidro Zavala, 45, entered the family home in south Florida on Saturday where he attacked his two sons Eduardo, 12, and 11-year-old Mario. Victoria Flores Zavala, 36, was watching TV at around 1.50am when she discovered her estranged husband choking one of her sons with a rope. Scroll down for video. 'Suicide': Isidro Zavala, 45, allegedly killed his own sons before taking shooting himself dead on Saturday. He also allegedly shot his youngest son several times at the home in Boynton Beach. One boy was found dead in a screened patio area, and the other was in the kitchen. Mrs Zavala told authorities her husband said that she had been spared so she could suffer the loss of her children, according to police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater. She. was not injured. Officers found both boys dead at the scene, and they. found Zavala, dressed all in black, dead with self-inflicted gunshot. wounds in the chest and head. The mother tried to fight him off and begged to be killed instead of her two boys. ‘He told her she was going to stay alive and suffer the loss of them,’ Slater said. 'This is an unusually brutal type of murder,' said Boynton Beach Police Chief Matthew Immler. Grisly: A crime scene photographer at the home in Boynton Beach today after a father strangled his two young sons before killing himself. Horror: A father allegedly strangled his two sons because he wanted his estranged wife to suffer. The couple had filed for divorce in October after nearly 20 years of marriage, according to the Palm Beach Post. They were scheduled to go to court on Tuesday for a mediation hearing. Zavala's roommate said he last saw his friend on Friday evening at their house, less than a mile away from the crime scene. Mariano Batalla said that Zavala said he couldn't attend a friend's birthday party because 'he had to do something important'. Mr Batalla said he returned from the. party around midnight and repeatedly tried to call Zavala, who never. answered his phone. Zavala's truck remained parked in their driveway. Police woke Batalla about 5am and told him what happened. 'I. feel so, so, so sad because he's my best friend,' Batalla said. 'It's a. big surprise for me. He don't tell me nothing about this.' Murder: A body is removed from a house in Boynton Beach, Florida where a father killed his two young sons in the early hours of Saturday. The Zavalas also have a 19-year-old son who does not live at his mother's house. Investigators found a note from Zavala to his oldest son in a bag at the crime scene. In the note, Zavala told the 19-year-old that he was a good son and to take care of himself, Immler said. The bag also contained a second gun, extra ammunition, duct tape and cutting shears. A second note was found at Isidro Zavala's home, but police did not release its contents. Batalla said that the second note was addressed to him. He said Zavala left him several hundred dollars and instructions to keep his truck and work tools. Victoria Zavala had been licensed as a cosmetologist, and Isidro Zavala owned a landscaping company. Children who live across the street say they last saw Mario several days ago when they were flying kites with another friend. They remembered him playing in their backyard or playing video games, and they could not understand why Mario's father would kill him. Police said they had never visited the Zavalas' home. A spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Families said the agency also had no previous history with the family. Batalla said he knew Zavala as a gentle friend who made pork and rice dishes for special occasions and who walked to church every weekend. Batalla had recently been baptized and he had encouraged Zavala to do the same. 'But he kept telling me, ''No, not yet,''' Batalla said. 'He said he wanted to learn more before he got baptized.'

Q:A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report.

The surgeon assessed the situation and thought about possible solutions to the problem. The first step would be to find an appropriately sized vat to accommodate the brain. The surgeon started searching through the available vats in the lab, looking for one that would be large enough for the brain. After careful consideration, the surgeon found a larger vat that seemed suitable for the task. The brain was carefully transferred to the new vat, ensuring that all necessary precautions were taken to maintain the integrity and safety of the brain during the transfer process. Next, the surgeon had to address the second issue - the brain itself was too small for the intended experiment. To remedy this, the surgeon thought of using artificial materials to increase the brain's size, while still preserving its functionality. The surgeon consulted with experts in the field of neuroscience to determine the best approach for this augmentation process. After gathering valuable input from the experts, a plan was put into action. Specialized nano materials, designed to mimic and integrate with brain tissue, were obtained for the procedure. Under the most sterile conditions, the surgeon carefully implanted these nano materials within the brain, increasing its size while ensuring the brain's overall structural integrity remained intact. Throughout the entire process, the surgeon made sure to constantly monitor the brain's activity and health. This way, the surgeon could promptly address any potential issues that might arise due to the augmentation process. In the end, the surgeon successfully stored the expanded brain inside the larger vat. Both issues - the size of the vat and the size of the brain - had been addressed effectively, allowing the surgeon to proceed with the experiment as planned. From this experience, the surgeon learned the importance of having the right equipment and being adaptable in the face of unexpected challenges. Furthermore, the surgeon gained invaluable insight into the potential of combining biological and technological advancements to push the limits of neuroscience research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: The structure of the boeing 787 has been described as essentially one giant macromolecule, where everything is fastened through cross-linked chemical bonds reinforced with this? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: carbon fiber–epoxy and boron fiber–epoxy composites. Compared with metals, these materials are 25%– 50% lighter and thus reduce operating costs. Similarly, the space shuttle payload bay doors and panels are made of a carbon fiber–epoxy composite. The structure of the Boeing 787 has been described as essentially one giant macromolecule, where everything is fastened through cross-linked chemical bonds reinforced with carbon fiber. Metal-matrix composites consist of metals or metal alloys reinforced with fibers. They offer significant advantages for high-temperature applications but pose major manufacturing challenges. For example, obtaining a uniform distribution and alignment of the reinforcing fibers can be difficult, and because organic polymers cannot survive the high temperatures of molten metals, only fibers composed of boron, carbon, or ceramic (such as silicon carbide) can be used. Aluminum alloys reinforced with boron fibers are used in the aerospace industry, where their strength and lightweight properties make up for their relatively high cost. The skins of hypersonic aircraft and structural units in the space shuttle are made of metal-matrix composites. Ceramic-matrix composites contain ceramic fibers in a ceramic matrix material. A typical example is alumina reinforced with silicon carbide fibers. Combining the two very high-melting-point materials results in a composite that has excellent thermal stability, great strength, and corrosion resistance, while the SiC fibers reduce brittleness and cracking. Consequently, these materials are used in very hightemperature applications, such as the leading edge of wings of hypersonic airplanes and jet engine parts. They are also used in the protective ceramic tiles on the space shuttle, which contain short fibers of pure SiO2 mixed with fibers of an aluminum–boron–silicate ceramic. These tiles are excellent thermal insulators and extremely light (their density is only about 0.2 g/cm3). Although their surface reaches a temperature of about 1250°C during...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence from a movie review: tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from a movie review, it appears that the movie was seen negatively. The phrase \\"tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot\\" suggests that the film attempted to include too many elements, themes, or subplots into its narrative in a way that felt forced or overwhelming. The use of the word \\"cram\\" indicates that this effort was not successful, and the overall effect was likely chaotic, confusing, or disjointed. The review is essentially stating that the movie would have benefited from a more focused and streamlined approach, rather than trying to cover a wider scope or range of issues in a limited space or runtime. This kind of critique is often directed at movies that lack cohesive storytelling, have underdeveloped characters, or suffer from narrative clutter and an overabundance of elements that do not contribute meaningfully to the story. When reading a movie review, it's important to consider the overall tone of the review and any additional context that might be available. In this case, the single sentence provided suggests a negative impression of the film, but it's critical to remember that this is just one aspect of the review. It's possible that there are other redeeming qualities mentioned or discussed, such as strong performances, impressive visuals, or innovative film techniques. However, based on the information given, we can conclude that this particular aspect of the movie was not well-received, contributing to an overall negative viewpoint."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Think back to when you first met your crush. Try to recall if you still feel the same or if your feelings have grown since then. What's commonly called “love at first sight” is often a sudden physical attraction, or infatuation. Love, on the other hand, increases over time from mere attraction to something deeper. Think about what you like and don't like about your crush. Seeing your reasons on paper might help you to better assess your feelings. Noting their drawbacks will toss a little cold water on your passions and let you think a little clearer about what it is that you do like. Make each side as long as you can. Don't worry about how major or trivial each pro or con is. Write down everything that comes to mind. You could include: Pros: good-looking, kind, someone I can talk to Cons: disorganized, immature at times, can be needy Analyze your pros and cons in terms of whether you're looking at reality or an idealized image of your crush. Circle or highlight which pros intensify your feelings and which cons don't affect how you feel. Evaluate whether those reasons are trivial or significant. If you can't accept the whole person—flaws and all—you're not in love. For example, you might be in love if you overlook their messiness because you're too busy appreciating their generosity or engaging conversations. On the other hand, you might not be in love if the sight of them makes feel warm and fuzzy, but you can't imagine a future with them. Pay attention to whether you share their happiness or sadness when they tell you good or bad news. For example, if you start to tear up when your crush tearfully tells you their grandmother died, you're feeling their pain. This is a good sign that you're in love. Ask yourself whether you mean it when you say, “I miss you.” Most lasting romantic love has an underlying bond that remains relatively steady over time. This doesn't mean you fret over missing them every second; in fact, that would be an unhealthy kind of attachment. But, missing your partner and wanting to bond with them is a key element of love. Imagine your life in five or ten years. Consider the impact of career changes, children, and relocations. Consider whether you're willing to face minor and life-threatening illnesses with this person. Think about taking care of them—or them taking care of you—as you grow old. If you can imagine a long-term future with this person, it's probably love. This doesn't mean you've done a complete 180 on your personality. Rather, reflect on whether you've expanded your horizons as a result of your crush. For example, maybe you never considered spending your weekend planting trees before your crush asked you to join them on a reforesting project. Now that you've done it, you feel this newfound connection with nature, and you owe it all to them. If you feel like this person has changed you for the better, it could be love. Take a mental note of how you feel the next time you and your crush do unexciting, everyday things together. For example, you normally hate grocery shopping but suddenly look forward to it because they're going to be with you. This is a sign that you could be in love. On the other hand, if you're still bored to tears and can't wait to do something fun, it's probably just infatuation. ” Notice how you feel when your crush talks to your potential rivals. Make a note of how you feel when those potential rivals flirt with your crush. You should also consider whether you suspect your crush might lose interest in you as a result of the flirtation. Periodic jealousy is actually a healthy reaction that can make you want to hang on to someone a bit tighter. In fact, you could be in love if you feel it. On the other hand, if you're suspicious and feel the urge to spy on your crush, it's not love. At least it's not healthy love. It's likely gone beyond infatuation into 'obsession'.","completion":"The article is about understanding the difference between love and infatuation by evaluating our feelings for someone, analyzing pros and cons of the relationship, and considering our emotions and long-term future with the person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital. <sep>How did Japanese feudalism impact Kyoto?<sep>Powerful families claimed whole regions Student:","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

In the fifth week, the couples \\"have a baby\\" and then struggle to cover the costs of baby clothes and furniture. In week eight, the marriage comes to the breaking point by such disaster as a mother-in-law's moving in or death. It's all over by week ten (the tenth year of marriage).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Black Seminoles are black Indians associated with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma. They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms. Throughout the period, several hundred Black Seminoles remained in the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Because most of the Seminole and the other Five Civilized Tribes supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War, in 1866 the US required new peace treaties with them. The US required the tribes emancipate any slaves and extend to the freedmen full citizenship rights in the tribes if they chose to stay in Indian Territory. In the late nineteenth century, Seminole Freedmen thrived in towns near the Seminole communities on the reservation. Most had not been living as slaves to the Indians before the war. They lived --as their descendants still do-- in and around Wewoka, Oklahoma, the community founded in 1849 by John Horse as a black settlement. Today it is the capital of the federally recognized Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. Following the Civil War, some Freedmen's leaders in Indian Territory practiced polygyny, as did ethnic African leaders in other diaspora communities. In 1900 there were 1,000 Freedmen listed in the population of the Seminole Nation in Indian Territory, about one-third of the total. By the time of the Dawes Rolls, there were numerous female-headed households registered. The Freedmen's towns were made up of large, closely connected families. After allotment, \\"[f]reedmen, unlike their [Indian] peers on the blood roll, were permitted to sell their land without clearing the transaction through the Indian Bureau. That made the poorly educated Freedmen easy marks for white settlers migrating from the Deep South.\\" Numerous Seminole Freedmen lost their land in the early decades after allotment, and some moved to urban areas. Others left the state because of its conditions of racial segregation. As US citizens, they were exposed to the harsher racial laws of Oklahoma. Since 1954, the Freedmen have been included in the constitution of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. They have two bands, each representing more than one town and named for 19th-century band leaders: the Cesar Bruner band covers towns south of Little River; the Dosar Barkus covers the several towns located north of the river. Each of the bands elects two representatives to the General Council of the Seminole Nation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who later appeared and surrendered his sword? In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands.","completion":"The first name of the person who later appeared and surrendered his sword is William.

However, the relationship between the choice of the targeted receptor and the quality and quantity of responses remains poorly understood.

Upon s.c. immunization, these complexes were initially taken up by CD169+ lymph node subcapsular sinus macrophages. In the OVA model system, receptor-targeted antigenic complexes primed specific T and B cell responses in vitro and in vivo at least 100-fold more efficiently than Ag alone. Comparison of 10 targeting receptors allowed us to establish a ranking with respect to priming of CD8+ T cell responses and demonstrated striking differences with respect to the relative efficacy of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subset and B cell priming.

Golf Journal: Why the PGA Tour’s Older Golfers Are Thriving Tom Watson’s near-victory last month at the British Open, at age 59, would have been a grand triumph for the age cohort Mr. Watson himself described as “geezers.” But I’m not as inclined as some golf fans and media sages to seek paranormal explanations for his performance. I was reminded more of what Gloria Steinem said on her 50th birthday, when someone told her she looked good for her age. “This is what 50 looks like,” she responded. Mr. Watson’s play at Turnberry is what 59 looks like, or at least what it can look like, when everything is right. It’s not as if there aren’t precedents for geezers playing well against the flat-bellies. At last year’s British Open, 53-year-old Greg Norman held a two-stroke lead going into the final round. Kenny Perry, at 48, came within a hair’s breadth of winning this year’s Masters (and has won five other Tour events in the last 14 months). Sam Snead won on the PGA Tour in 1965 at age 52, and at 62 finished third at the PGA Championship behind Lee Trevino. Even Ben Hogan, with his crippled legs, contended at the 1967 Masters at 54, shooting the lowest round of the tournament, a 66 on Saturday, before finishing 10th after a final-round 77. In talking this week with some of the world’s best older players, I came away convinced that age per se is not the obstacle most people think it is. “As long as you’re feeling pretty good health-wise, age is not a big factor,” Fred Funk told me Wednesday, a few days after winning the U.S. Senior Open at the 7,316-yard Crooked Stick course in Indiana with a record-smashing 20-under-par total. One problem for senior players, Mr. Funk acknowledged, is that compared with the young pros they spend significantly more time not feeling pretty good health-wise, primarily from overuse injuries. Mr. Funk, for instance, had to have his knee drained 18 times last year, following surgery on it in the spring. The 16th of those needle pricks gave him a staph infection, from which he needed months (and six weeks on an IV line) to recover. This spring, swinging awkwardly to compensate for his still-weak knee, he tore the labrum in his left shoulder. Nevertheless, thanks to aggressive therapy on his shoulder and a whopping new knee brace, he can now swing (if not walk) mostly without pain, and thus play up to his 53-year-old potential. Two weeks ago he lost in a playoff (to Loren Roberts) at the British Senior Open. “I’m a better player now than I’ve ever been,” Mr. Funk said. Hale Irwin, 64, also believes he played his best golf in his early 50s, despite having won 20 times in regular Tour events, including three U.S. Opens. On the Senior Tour (now called the Champions Tour), he has won 45 times. “I was clicking on all cylinders. I was comfortable in my business career. I was comfortable with my family. I was probably in the best physical shape of my life. And the want and the need to compete was still there,” he told me. Performances like Mr. Watson’s at the British Open inspire everyday amateurs in part because the gap between us and same-age pros grows wider each year. Flexibility, in particular, gets harder to maintain. “The guys I knew who were good amateurs in their 30s and 40s, that’s where they’ve lost it,” said Mr. Roberts, age 54. “The longer they sit behind desks in their sedentary jobs, the harder it is.” Since turning 40, Mr. Roberts said, he’s had to work roughly twice as hard as before to keep his game sharp—but he can do it, because that’s his job. Moreover, as Mr. Irwin pointed out, crafty old pros figure out ways to work around any physical limitation. Amateurs usually can’t. Thanks to modern equipment, aging pros don’t sacrifice much length off the tee. “Everybody’s so long these days it doesn’t even matter. It’s the short game that matters,” Mr. Irwin said. Putting, in fact, is often the first thing to go. In many cases that’s because of changes in eyesight that, even with corrective lenses or Lasik surgery, can subtly affect depth perception in different lights. Nerves can be a factor, too—both in the sense of nerve endings (older people sometimes get shaky) and in the sense of confidence. “If you’re not playing as well as you used to and start to get frustrated, a lot of times that becomes most apparent in your putting,” Mr. Irwin said. Another issue older golfers face is waning intensity. “Once or twice a round these days, I make some kind of silly mistake because I’m just not paying attention. I go blank in the head,” said Robert McKinney of Houston, the best older amateur player I know. At age 64, he’s still winning major amateur events against players a third his age. “Maybe it’s just complacency. I’ve seen those shots so many times before.” Mr. Irwin has noticed the same phenomenon. “The funnel gets bigger when you get older. You take in more things than when you were younger and thinking just about golf. Your interests are broader, you’ve got grandchildren now,” he said, which makes it more difficult to pay full attention to every single putting stroke. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. “I don’t want to play competitive golf until I’m 100,” he said. “I’ve still got other mountains to climb.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text talks about older golfers (also called \\"geezers\\") in the PGA Tour and how they are still able to thrive and play well even as they age. It explains that age is not as big a factor in golf as long as the players are in good health. However, older players often struggle with more injuries and need to work harder to maintain their flexibility and strength. Some reasons why older golfers can still play well include modern equipment that helps them hit the ball far, their experience which helps them make smart decisions during the game, and their ability to work around any physical limitations. Putting can be a challenge for older players because of changes in eyesight and nerves. Finally, one issue they face is a lack of intensity or focus due to having broader interests and more distractions in their lives."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: What was supposed to be a straightforward cash deal to carry a child for desperate parents has turned into an international spat over who said what, and exposed the darker side of a business credited with creating happiness for many couples. At the center of the debate is Gammy, a seven-month-old Down Syndrome baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in Thailand. For days, Gammy's surrogate mother, 21-year-old Thai food stall worker Pattharamon Chanbua, has been telling local and foreign press that the couple abandoned their son, taking home his healthy sister. After initially denying they knew about baby Gammy, a friend of the couple issued a statement to a local Australian newspaper saying the pair only left Gammy because they were told he was likely to die. \\"Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,\\" the unnamed friend told the Bunbury Mail, in Western Australia, where the couple live. Fear and lies. The friend said the surrogate mother gave birth at a different hospital to the one agreed upon, which made the surrogacy agreement void. The couple was scared, she said, that Pattharamon would change her mind about the second child, and they'd have to leave Thailand with no children at all. According to the report, the friend noted that the backdrop to the surrogacy row was a military coup in the country and \\"it was very difficult to get around.\\" The takeover took place in the early hours of May 22, 2014 when Commander of the Royal Thai Army General Prayuth Chan-chua announced in a national broadcast he was now in charge. \\"This has been absolutely devastating for them, they are on the edge,\\" the friend added, referring to the days of media scrutiny and debate over their decision, months after they returned home. Pattharamon claimed the couple asked her to terminate the Down Syndrome child when she was seven months pregnant. Not true, the couple's friend said. After the babies' birth, Pattharamon claimed they bought nappies and milk for the baby girl, but \\"didn't even look at the boy.\\" Also a lie, the friend added. Whatever the details of who said what, the case has attracted attention to a largely unregulated industry subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes. Surrogate 'is legal parent' In the state of Western Australia, where the couple is from, it's legal to seek surrogacy abroad. There are no checks for criminal history, and no counseling is required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy, said Jenni Millbank, an expert in Australian surrogacy law from the University of Technology in Sydney. \\"If surrogacy were taken onshore there would be counseling protocols prior to conception, as well as a welfare report after birth required before legal parentage is transferred; but these are not steps that occur with offshore surrogacy,\\" said Millbank. She said the surrogate mother is the legal parent regardless of whose egg was used. The rights of the genetic father are also \\"uncertain\\" as \\"different judges have taken varied approaches,\\" she said. Australian authorities are looking into the case, as are Thai authorities, who had already announced a crackdown on the industry amid claims rules were being flouted. Pattharamon said she agreed to be paid 300,000 baht (9,300) for carrying the couple's babies, money she needed to help care for her own two children, aged six and three. After she voiced concerns about how she was going to pay for Gammy's care, funds started flowing to an online campaign, which to date has raised more than 237,000 (US220,000). Could baby girl be returned? Pattharamon said she's prepared to take the baby girl back if the Australian couple is are \\"not ready\\" to take care of her. She said she doesn't intend to pursue legal action against the parents, though Millbank says she could apply to the Family Court of Australia to have the child returned. \\"The Family Court of Australia has jurisdiction over anyone who has an interest in the care, welfare and a development of a child so (the intending parents) could still make their case and argue for the baby to live with them,\\" Millbank said. \\"The court would examine the competitive proposals of the parties, probably appoint an independent children's lawyer and do a welfare assessment of the child's needs and then make a decision.\\" The Australian courts have only ever heard one case involving a child born via surrogacy, Millbank said. It involved a child called \\"Evelyn\\" whose birth was the result of an agreement between friends that went wrong. \\"That was in the 1980s and they ended up removing the child from the family that had been raising her and taking her to the other family,\\" Millbank said. \\"It was an altruistic arrangement where the birth mother changed her mind about seven months later. And she ultimately won. She got the child back.\\" Highlights:","completion":"- A seven-month-old baby with Down Syndrome and a congenital heart condition named Gammy has become the center of an international surrogacy dispute between his Thai surrogate mother, Pattharamon Chanbua, and his Australian biological parents. - Pattharamon claims the couple abandoned Gammy while taking home his healthy sister, while a friend of the couple stated they left Gammy because they were told he was likely to die and the surrogacy agreement was void due to changes in the birth plan. - This case has brought attention to the largely unregulated international surrogacy industry, which is subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes. - In Western Australia, where the couple is from, it is legal to seek surrogacy abroad, with no checks for criminal history and no counseling required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy. - Australian and Thai authorities are looking into the case, with Pattharamon stating she is prepared to take back the baby girl if the Australian couple is not ready to take care of her, but she does not intend to pursue legal action."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Context: The 1469 marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon and the 1479 death of John II of Aragon led to the creation of modern-day Spain. In 1492, Granada was captured from the Moors, thereby completing the Reconquista. Portugal had during the 15th century – particularly under Henry the Navigator – gradually explored the coast of Africa, and in 1498, Vasco da Gama found the sea route to India. The Spanish monarchs met the Portuguese challenge by financing the expedition of Christopher Columbus to find a western sea route to India, leading to the discovery of the Americas in 1492.

Joel would always wash his car every morning unlike Logan, due to Available options: - Joel being a clean freak. - Logan being a clean freak.","completion":"Joel would always wash his car every morning unlike Logan, due to Joel being a clean freak. This deep-rooted obsession with cleanliness stemmed from his childhood experiences, where his parents always emphasized the importance of maintaining a pristine environment. In those formative years, Joel had been ingrained with the belief that neatness, order, and organization were essential aspects of personal responsibility and success. Consequently, he carried this mindset into his adult life, applying it not only to the care of his car but also to every element of his daily routine. On the other hand, Logan, who had grown up with a less rigorous upbringing, did not share the same desire for cleanliness. Although he wasn't a complete slob, he was far more relaxed about his living space. In fact, he often teased Joel about his compulsive cleaning habits, considering them to be a little extreme and unnecessary. Despite their differences, however, the two friends found common ground in various aspects of their lives, allowing their friendship to thrive regardless of their contrasting attitudes. It's worth noting that both men's attitudes towards cleanliness were shaped by the unique circumstances of their upbringing. For Joel, the discipline and structure provided by his parents undoubtedly played a significant role in developing his meticulous nature. Meanwhile, Logan's more lenient parents fostered an environment that allowed for more freedom and exploration in terms of his habits and preferences, leading to his more easy-going attitude. Nonetheless, this difference in attitude did not come without its consequences. Joel's stubborn commitment to cleanliness often resulted in him spending excessive amounts of time ensuring that everything was in order, leaving him with little opportunity for leisure or relaxation. Conversely, Logan's untroubled demeanor occasionally caused him to neglect essential responsibilities, tarnishing his image among others as careless and disorganized. Overall, the way Joel and Logan approached car maintenance is a reflection of their contrasting beliefs and values in relation to cleanliness. While Joel's strict adherence to a spotless lifestyle provided him with a sense of order and control, it came at the expense of spontaneity and relaxation. On the other hand, Logan's free-spirited and nonchalant attitude towards cleanliness allowed him to embrace life's unpredictability, though sometimes leading to disarray and unplanned consequences. Despite these differing perspectives, both friends managed to maintain a resonant bond, ultimately proving that a shared love for cleanliness doesn't determine the strength of a friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Living on a busy street could drive you to snore. Sleepers exposed to traffic pollution are more likely to saw logs and suffer daytime drowsiness, according to a study being unveiled at the annual European Respiratory Society (ERS) meeting in London this week. Researchers from Bergen University in Norway studied 12,000 snoozers across Europe, and discovered that 25% of men snored heavily at least three nights a week, and those slumbering surrounded by toxic fumes and loud noises high-traffic areas were most likely to snore. A quarter of women who lived near motorways, on the other hand, were more likely to suffer extreme daytime sleepiness rather than snore. “We know that people exposed to secondary cigarette smoking are more likely to snore,” Ane Johannessen, an epidemiologist at Bergen University behind the report, told The Times U.K. “So we wondered if the toxins from traffic pollution might also be linked to snoring.” Lack of sleep increases breast cancer risk: study They are — but really only in men. The study found that the gases and particles released in vehicle exhaust combined with the sounds of blaring horns and rumbling motors, disrupts sleep. Professor Stephen Holgate, the ERS’s science council chairman, warned that living by a main road hurts the lungs as much as smoking 10 cigarettes a day, especially when inhaling diesel fumes. But the scientists aren’t yet sure why the side effects of a bad night’s sleep differed between the sexes so that men snore, and women need a nap. “One could speculate whether women who have husbands who snore experience more daytime sleepiness, but the key is understanding the impact of pollution,” Johannessen and her colleagues wrote. If you can’t pack up and move away from a boulevard of broken dreams just yet, try sound-proofing your room, wearing earbuds and making sure your windows are shut tight to keep out pollutants and get some peace and quiet at bedtime.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when slavery abolished Suggested answer: In 1787 Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory . Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"The suggested answer partially addresses the abolition of slavery, but it does not provide a comprehensive and accurate explanation. Therefore, you should not validate this answer as it is. A more detailed and well-rounded response should cover the different aspects and key dates related to the abolition of slavery. The abolition of slavery occurred gradually, with various countries and regions addressing the issue independently. In the United States, the abolition movement gained prominence during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, culminating in the 13th Amendment's ratification in 1865, which officially abolished slavery throughout the country. The year 1787 mentioned in the suggested answer refers to the Northwest Ordinance, which indeed prohibited slavery in the newly established Northwest Territory. However, this law only applied to that specific region and did not mean the abolition of slavery in other parts of the country. In 1808, the United States prohibited the importation of slaves, making it illegal to bring new slaves into the country, although this did not abolish the practice of slavery itself. It wasn't until the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, that slavery began to be abolished more broadly in the United States. While the proclamation initially only applied to the Confederate states, the 13th Amendment, ratified on December 6, 1865, ultimately abolished slavery nationwide. It is important to note that the abolition of slavery did not occur simultaneously across the world. For instance, Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807 with the passage of the Slave Trade Act and later abolished slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833 through the Slavery Abolition Act. France abolished slavery in its colonies in 1848, and Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888. In summary, simply stating that Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory in 1787 does not provide a comprehensive and accurate answer to the question of when slavery was abolished. It is necessary to address various key moments in history and acknowledge that the abolition of slavery took place at different times in different regions."},{"prompt":"Q:Article: Living in a foreign culture can be exciting, but it can also be confusing .

She later learned that the woman had answered her: She had raised her eyebrows , which in Micronesia means\\"yes\\". Jan remembered an experience she had in Bulgaria, a country in Europe. She went to a restaurant that was known for its cabbage. She asked the waiter, \\"Do you have cabbage today? \\"He nodded his head. Jan waited, but the cabbage never came. In that country, a nod means\\"no\\". Tom had a similar problem when he arrived in India. After explaining something in class, he asked his students if they understood. They answered with many different nods and shakes of the head. He thought some people had not understood, so he explained again. When he asked again, they did the same thing. He soon found out that his students did understand. In India, people nod and shake their heads in different ways depending on where they come from.

Q: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more. It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. Question: Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? === The answer to the above question is Select from the following. a). More calories will be burned b). So there is more time in the day to exercise, since you will be done with chores faster c). Stretching your arms will make you more flexible d). not enough information The answer is:","completion":"a). More calories will be burned"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In chemistry, pH () (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7 (25°C), being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. pH measurements are important in agronomy, medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineering, chemical engineering, nutrition, water treatment and water purification, as well as many other applications. The pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement. Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference, by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode. The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter, or an indicator.

Paris The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.

Like Out of Time, Monster topped the charts in both the US and UK. The record sold about nine million copies worldwide. The singles \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts. Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from Automatic for the People for release as Parallel in 1995.In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years.

Many years later, an adult Noah is living with his wife Naameh and their sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather Methuselah. They encounter a group of people recently killed and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the \\"Watchers\\", confined on Earth as stone golems (nephilim) for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. Once a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an ark. After birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are put to sleep with incense. With Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth, but upon witnessing the settlers' exchanging their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the creator wants all of humanity dead. Back at the ark, he tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations.

Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sunlight enters the cell happens, how will it affect MORE/FASTER weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation (more sunlight entering the cell) can have both direct and indirect effects on the weathering process of wood. Direct effect: 1. Temperature Change: Increased sunlight will raise the temperature of the wood surface. As temperature increases, the rate of evaporation of moisture from the wood also increases. This can lead to more frequent and rapid cycles of absorption and evaporation of moisture, which exacerbates the deterioration of the wood's protective finish. 2. UV Radiation Damage: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight can break down the chemical bonds in the wood, as well as its protective finish. This can cause the wood to lose its luster, become discolored, and lead to weakening of the finish. As a result, the finish may become more susceptible to being stripped away when it rains. Indirect effect: 3. Algae, Fungi, and Mold Growth: Increased sunlight can promote the growth of algae, fungi, and mold on the wood surface. These microorganisms flourish in the presence of moisture and can contribute to the wood's discoloration and degradation. Additionally, they may produce acids that can further break down the wood and its finish. 4. Environmental Factors: More sunlight can impact the surrounding environment and lead to alterations in humidity, wind patterns, and precipitation, all of which can influence the weathering process. For example, if increased sunlight created a drier environment, it might prolong the time it takes for rainwater to evaporate from the wood or even cause cracks, which further accelerates the deterioration of the finish and can expose the wood to rain and other environmental factors. In summary, the perturbation of increased sunlight exposure can directly accelerate the weathering of wood by contributing to temperature changes, UV radiation damage, and indirectly, by promoting microbial growth and altering the surrounding environment. All of these factors can lead to a faster degradation of the wood's protective finish, leaving it vulnerable to rain and other environmental factors that can cause further damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct zones ( Figure below ):. Choices: - nematology - oceanography - hydrology - limnology A: Answer:","completion":"Limnology Given the provided paragraph and choices, the correct answer is limnology. According to the paragraph, limnology is defined as the study of the plants and animals that live in fresh water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. Limnology is a sub-discipline of the broader fields of environmental science, ecology, and geosciences, and it plays a crucial role in understanding and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. The study of limnology encompasses various aspects of freshwater ecosystems, including their physical, chemical, and biological properties. This field of study covers the investigation, description, and management of inland waters, such as rivers, lakes, and other water bodies, as well as the organisms inhabiting them. In limnological research, freshwater ecosystems are typically divided into three separate zones, as mentioned in the paragraph provided. These zones are: 1. Littoral zone: This zone is found near the shoreline, where light penetrates to the bottom, allowing for rooted plant growth. It is the most biodiverse zone in a freshwater body, supporting multiple species of fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants. 2. Limnetic zone: This refers to the open water area of a lake or pond that is deeper and farther away from the shore. Light can still penetrate the surface, but the depth of this zone inhibits rooted plant growth. It is primarily inhabited by phytoplankton (microscopic plants) and zooplankton (microscopic animals), which serve as the base of the food chain in lakes and ponds. 3. Profundal zone: This is the deepest and darkest zone in a freshwater body, with minimal light penetration. Here, the environment is characterized by cooler temperatures and lower oxygen levels. Few organisms can survive in these conditions, and the organisms that do usually have special adaptations for living in such an environment, such as consuming detritus and other organic material that falls from the zones above. In conclusion, limnology is the scientific discipline that focuses on the study of freshwater ecosystems, including the plants and animals that inhabit them. This field is vital for understanding the complex interactions and factors that influence the health and sustainability of lakes, rivers, and other inland water bodies.

Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. Guess a valid title for it!

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can a magnet moving in a coil of copper cause?\\" is \\"h2o\\", given that a magnet moving in a coil of copper can cause a flow of electrons? The answer is:","completion":"No, the assertion that the correct answer to the question \\"what can a magnet moving in a coil of copper cause?\\" is \\"H2O\\" is incorrect. This is because H2O refers to water, which is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Water has no direct relationship to the physical effect caused by a magnet moving in a coil of copper. The phenomenon of a magnet moving in a coil of copper is a fundamental concept of electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday who observed that a change in the magnetic field within a coil of wire induces an electromotive force or voltage in the wire. Essentially, when a magnet is passed through a coil of copper wire, it causes the electrons within the copper wire to move, resulting in the generation of an electric current. This is due to a principle called Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced electromotive force or voltage in a closed loop is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. When a magnet is moved in and out of a coil, it changes the magnetic field. The change in magnetic field induces a voltage which causes the electrons in the wire to move, generating an electric current. The direction of this induced current is given by Lenz's law, which states that it will always be such that it opposes the change causing it. Thus, if you move the magnet into the coil, the induced current will generate a magnetic field opposing the magnet's motion. Moving the magnet out of the coil, the induced current will generate a magnetic field attempting to keep the magnet moving in. This principle is utilized in many common electrical technologies such as generators, transformers, electric guitars, and even wireless charging pads for electric toothbrushes and smartphones. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be \\"the movement of a magnet within a coil of copper can induce an electric current.\\" This response reflects the physical principles at work, which involve the interactions between magnetic fields and conductive materials like copper, rather than the chemical composition of water (H2O)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. Question: \\"What test must women undergo 34 hours before an abortion is performed where a doctor must give a verbal explanation of the results \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson\\"?\\" Response: \\"A blood test\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What were the last names of the two squatters who were the earliest settlers of the park? , can you please find it? Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in...

Input: Article: Culture helps human societies survive in changing natural environment.For example, the end of the last Ice Age, beginning about 15,000 years ago, brought a big challenge to which humans had to adapt.Before this time, large parts of the northern hemisphere were covered in great sheets of ice that contained much of the earth' s water.In North America, large animals that wandered the vast tundra provided people with food and materials for clothing and simple shelters.When the earth became warm, large Ice Age animals disappeared, and many land areas were covered by rising sea levels from melting ice.But people survived, they developed new technologies and learned how to survive on new plant and animal species. Finally some people settled into permanent villages, durable houses and farms. Cultural adaptation has made humans one of the most successful species on the planet. Through history, major developments in technology, medicine, and nutrition have allowed people to reproduce and survive in ever-increasing numbers.The global population has risen from 8 million during the Ice Age to about 6 billion today. However, the successes of culture adaptation can also create problems in the long run.Over the last 200 years, people have begun to use large quantities of natural resources and energy and to produce a great amount of material and chemical wastes.The global population now consumes some important natural resources--such as petroleum, wood, and minerals--faster than nature can produce them.Many scientists believe that in the process of burning fuels and producing wastes, people may be changing the global climate in unpredictable and possibly harmful ways.Thus, the adaptive success of the present-day global culture of production and trade may be temporary.

Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. Which island had more big-beaked birds survive? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the island that had experienced a drought in recent years would have more big-beaked birds survive. This is because during the drought, there were fewer seeds available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could only eat the smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. Since the small-beaked birds struggled to find enough food during the drought, many of them died. On the other hand, the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced, resulting in an increase in the average beak size in the finch population. This is an example of evolution by natural selection. Since Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years and Island 2 did not, it is more likely that there would be a larger population of big-beaked birds surviving on Island 1 as they had a selective advantage during the drought."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: This seems like a nice adapter, but... Review: This adapter does not work with Windows Me. Although it appears to have all the features you want at a really nice price, the D-link card is not a good value. In comparison to a premium card, such as Xircom or 3Com, the D-Link card uses 5 volts instead of 3.3 volts, which drains a portable PC's battery much faster. Also, the D-Link card does not have cell phone hookups or a global modem, which limits its use even further. Finally, the company's web site has sparse technical data and the phone technical support department operates on a 'call-back' system that very rarely returns calls. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. It begins neutrally with the title stating, \\"This seems like a nice adapter, but...\\" suggesting some forthcoming concerns or shortcomings about the product. Immediately after, the reviewer mentions a major compatibility issue, \\"This adapter does not work with Windows Me,\\" which constitutes a strong negative tone as it limits the product's usability for those who have this system. The phrase \\"is not a good value,\\" further emphasises the negative sentiment. In the middle of the review, the writer compares the item unfavorably to competitors' products by stating, \\"In comparison to a premium card, such as Xircom or 3Com, the D-Link card uses 5 volts instead of 3.3 volts, which drains a portable PC's battery much faster.\\" These pointed comparisons serve to highlight the deficiencies of the D-link card, thereby adding a layer of dissatisfactory undertone to the product review. The reviewer also elaborates on the lack of certain features, such as \\"the D-Link card does not have cell phone hookups or a global modem.\\" This further projects the product's lack of versatility, contributing to the overall negative tone. Additionally, criticism of the company's technical support adds to the negativity, as it suggests poor service for customers. So, all these elements combined—the product's incompatibility with certain systems, unfavorable comparisons, lack of essential features, and inadequate customer support—convey a predominantly negative tone. Despite acknowledging that the adapter \\"appears to have all the features you want at a really nice price,\\" the weight of the negative remarks far outweighs this neutral-to-slightly positive statement, fueling an overall tone of dissatisfaction and disapproval."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? A) He mixed it with several oils instead of water. B) He put some beer into the mixture. C) He added more coffee into the mixture than before. D) He added some cola nut oil and a few other oils. Answer:","completion":"D) He added some cola nut oil and a few other oils. John Styth Pemberton changed the French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious by adding some cola nut oil and a few other oils to the mixture. Initially, he had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, but the resulting product tasted awful. In an attempt to improve the flavor of his new syrup, Pemberton decided to add cola nut oil and a few other oils, which ultimately led to the creation of the Coca-Cola syrup that we know today. This innovative combination of ingredients helped enhance the taste and contributed to the success of the drink, which has become a worldwide phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ducasse held 21 Michelin stars across his portfolio of establishments at the time. Born in 1956 in Castelsarrasin, France, Alain Ducasse began his culinary career at the age of 16, working with renowned French chefs such as Alain Chapel, Roger Vergé, and Michel Guérard. Over the years, Ducasse established his unique cooking style, blending traditional French cuisine with modern techniques and a strong emphasis on high-quality ingredients. Ducasse's first success as a chef came in 1984, when he was awarded his first Michelin star while working at L'Amandier in Mougins, France. He gained a second star in 1987 at La Terrasse in Juan-les-Pins. In 1990, he achieved his first three-star rating at Le Louis XV at the Hotel de Paris Monte-Carlo in Monaco, becoming the youngest chef ever to receive such an accolade. Throughout the years, Ducasse continued to expand his culinary empire, opening acclaimed restaurants around the world, such as Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester in London, Le Jules Verne in Paris, and Alain Ducasse at Morpheus in Macau. His establishments have consistently earned Michelin stars, solidifying his reputation as one of the world's finest chefs. It is worth noting that the number of Michelin stars held by chefs can fluctuate yearly, and other chefs like Joël Robuchon (who passed away in 2018) were also among the most Michelin-starred chefs that year, with 32 Michelin stars during his lifetime and holding 31 stars in 2016. However, as of 2018, Alain Ducasse held the title of the most Michelin stars.

It also indicates that there have been four head coaches for the team.

To determine if the sentence \\"All four of the head coaches of the Houston Texans have coached elsewhere in the National Football League (NFL)\\" is true, additional information regarding the coaching history of these individuals would be needed. By researching the coaching history of each of the four head coaches of the Houston Texans, we can assess the validity of the statement. Here is an overview of the coaching history of the four head coaches: 1. Dom Capers (Head Coach from 2002 to 2005): Capers has coached elsewhere in the NFL, serving in various roles, such as defensive coordinator and head coach, for teams including the Carolina Panthers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, Green Bay Packers, and others. 2. Gary Kubiak (Head Coach from 2006 to 2013): Kubiak has also coached elsewhere in the NFL, working as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos before becoming the head coach of the Houston Texans. After his time with the Texans, he returned to the Broncos as the head coach and later served as an offensive advisor for the Minnesota Vikings. 3. Bill O'Brien (Head Coach from 2014 to 2020): Before his tenure with the Houston Texans, O'Brien worked as an offensive assistant, wide receivers coach, and quarterbacks coach for the New England Patriots. After leaving the Texans, he joined the Alabama Crimson Tide coaching staff as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. 4. David Culley (Head Coach since 2021): Culley has a long coaching history in the NFL, working with various teams in different coaching roles. Before becoming the head coach of the Houston Texans, he served on the coaching staff of the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, among others. Based on the coaching history of these four individuals, we can conclude that the sentence, \\"All four of the head coaches of the Houston Texans have coached elsewhere in the National Football League (NFL),\\" is true.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

However, we can draw some related observations and hypotheses from the information given. First, let's consider the statement made by Eric Gurr, the creator of U4Prez.com: \\"I think most of our users have accounts on MySpace and Facebook, and use U4prez strictly for the political dialogue.\\" From this statement, we can infer a hypothesis that U4Prez.com has a more niche audience and is not necessarily intended to compete directly with social networking giants like MySpace and Facebook. It appears that the website caters to users who are specifically interested in political topics and discussions. Another hypothesis we can derive is that U4Prez.com could be a complementary platform to MySpace or Facebook for the politically-engaged users. Gurr emphasizes that his site is \\"all about the politics.\\" This suggests that U4Prez.com serves a distinct purpose from MySpace and Facebook, and its users might see value in maintaining accounts on both websites for different reasons. Additionally, the context provided does not give us any data on the site's popularity compared to MySpace or even in general. Therefore, any hypothesis on U4Prez.com's popularity would be purely speculative without further information. In conclusion, while we can deduce several hypotheses related to the niche focus and audience of U4Prez.com, the provided context does not offer sufficient evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that the site is not as popular as MySpace. To draw a solid conclusion, we would need more information such as user statistics, engagement metrics, or expert opinions comparing the two platforms' popularity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant. Question: Why men at Bridges House called Locotus Grandpa Munster: === The answer to the above question is Choose from: A). not enough information; B). Because he looked older than father time.; C).

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Paragraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would new surfaces be exposed or stay covered in sample A?

He is one of the founding members of this American rock band, which was formed in 2013 in Southfield, Michigan. Apart from being the clean vocalist, Brian also takes up occasional guitar duties for the band. I Prevail's music can be categorized as a mixture of metalcore, post-hardcore, and alternative rock, which has contributed to their massive success in the rock and metal scene. Brian Burkheiser was born on October 22, 1992, and during his time with I Prevail, he has demonstrated exceptional vocal abilities, dynamic stage presence, and relatable lyrics that resonate with fans and listeners. Before starting the band, he connected with fellow I Prevail member Eric Vanlerberghe through mutual friends while attending Rochester College. It is worth mentioning that Eric also serves as a co-vocalist in the band, focusing on harsh vocals, which perfectly complements Brian's clean vocals and contributes to the band's signature sound. Since its formation, I Prevail has released three full-length studio albums – \\"Lifelines\\" (2016), \\"Trauma\\" (2019), and an extended play (EP) called \\"Heart vs. Mind\\" (2014). Their initial rise to fame can largely be attributed to their heavy-hitting cover of Taylor Swift's pop hit \\"Blank Space,\\" which gained millions of views on YouTube and introduced the band to a global audience. Brian Burkheiser and I Prevail continue to make an impact in the world of rock music with their high-energy live performances and a sound that bridges the gap between heavy and melodic genres.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Illegal immigrants working in UK face six months in prison, ministers announce It means that instead of being taken to detention centres, illegal migrants will be processed through the courts before being taken to jail. Ministers believe it will act as a deterrent and prevent thousands of migrants attempting to gain access to the UK from European ports including Calais. • If Britain bends to pressure, where would we put a quota of migrants? • Couple wed for 45 years claim immigration officials do not believe marriage is genuine As part of the new measures, off-licences, curry houses, Chinese restaurants and other takeaway firms will face closure if they are found to be employing illegal workers. The Government will also consider extending these powers to cover minicab firms, the Home Office said. It came as Eurotunnel services were on Monday hit by serious delays after migrants were found on French rail track near Calais. Migrants in France Photo: AFP Trains were held up by an hour after the migrants went on to the track in the area around Frethun station. Mr Brokenshire said: “Anyone who thinks the UK is a soft touch should be in no doubt – if you are here illegally, we will take action to stop you from working, renting a flat, opening a bank account or driving a car.” He added: “Through our new Immigration Bill, illegal workers will face the prospect of a prison term and rogue employers could have their businesses closed, have their licences removed, or face prosecution if they continue to flout the law.” The decision to impose prison sentences on illegal immigrants is a major shift in Government policy and shows the level of concern in Downing Street about the influx of foreigners coming to the UK. In the weeks after the general election, David Cameron vowed to make the UK a “less attractive place to come and work”. He announced plans to allow the police to seize wages from foreign workers and said that they would face deportation without appeal if they are in the UK illegally. However, he made no mention of potential prison sentences. It is thought that the migrant crisis in southern Europe and well as the increasing numbers of foreigners attempting to reach the UK from Calais have forced ministers to intensify the planned crackdown. Under the new rules, any employer suspected of flouting immigration laws could see their business closed for up to 48 hours while they prove right to work checks have been conducted on staff. Migrants wait near the perimeter fence at Calais Photo: Will Wintercross/The Telegraph • Calais migrants: Theresa May calls for 'urgent' security upgrade as 1,500 try to storm Channel Tunnel • French riot police in battle with Calais migrants, in pictures The worst offenders would then be placed under special measures and could face long-term closure. The Home Office said that any pub, off-licence or late-night takeaway that fails to comply with immigration laws or employs illegal workers could also be stripped of their licence to operate.","completion":"The UK government has announced that illegal immigrants found working in the country could face up to six months in prison.

The Briton, whose championship-leading team mate Nico Rosberg will be on pole position for his home race, qualified 16th on Saturday despite spinning into the barriers early on. However, he gained a position because Sauber's Mexican Esteban Gutierrez carried over a three-place demotion from the previous race. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a Ride on board with Lewis Hamilton for a lap of the German GP Thinking time: The OPTIONS: - British former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Briton former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Esteban Gutierrez former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Formula One former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - German former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Grand Prix former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Hamilton former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Lewis Hamilton former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Mercedes former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Mexican former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Nico Rosberg former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th - Sauber former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th","completion":"Lewis Hamilton former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th. Explanation: The correct answer is \\"Lewis Hamilton former World Champion sat out the rest of qualifying and will start from 20th\\" because the question tells us that Lewis Hamilton is the one who crashed during qualifying, so he is the one who had to sit out the rest of the qualifying. The other options are wrong because they don't describe who the sentence is really about: Lewis Hamilton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Outside of employment, what is the other main issue that affirmative action focuses on?","completion":"The other main issue that affirmative action focuses on, outside of employment, is education. Affirmative action in education seeks to support historically disadvantaged groups, ensuring they are given fair and increased opportunities to enter and succeed within educational institutions.

Q:Question: \\"Which of the following is not a type of division in Libya: regional, entrenched, or tribal?\\" Context: \\"Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Among the divisions mentioned in the context provided for Libya, entrenched is not a type of division. The divisions in Libya highlighted are regional and tribal. The context discusses how Idris' government took actions that worsened these divisions by centralizing the country's federal system for oil wealth conquest, leading to corruption and widespread patronage in the oil industry. As Arab nationalism grew in popularity in the 1960s, Libya experienced anti-western riots and protests due to its alignment with Western powers and a perception of being pro-Israeli. This strained relationship, along with regional and tribal divisions, contributed to the eventual coup involving Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's the second most common cancer for men worldwide, but prostate cancer remains difficult to diagnose, with standard blood tests criticized for delivering a high rate of false positives. But in a study presented in May this year, trained detection dogs were able to identify prostate cancer from a few sniffs of a urine sample with a staggering 98% accuracy, with few false positives. Although the study is by no means conclusive, it joins a growing body of research suggesting dogs could be able to smell out cancers. However, there are numerous practical problems in using dogs to detect cancers in a medical setting (not least training, consistency and identifying exactly which chemicals the dogs are detecting), which is why scientists are seeking to harness the potential detection ability of man's best friend through the development of an \\"electronic nose\\" capable of making a diagnosis. 'Easily sniffed' Finnish researchers are using a device that conducts molecular analysis of the atmosphere in the \\"headspace\\" above urine samples, and tests it for the volatile organic compounds associated with prostate cancer. In a study published earlier this year, the method had a detection rate of 78%, and a specificity (the probability of the test being negative when cancer is absent) of 67%. \\"We see molecules at the stages when the tumor is very small,\\" said lead investigator Dr. Niku Oksala, of the University of Tampere. \\"We can also find whether it is aggressive or benign to know what action is needed.\\" Oksala's team is continuing to refine the method, such as through removing impurities for cleaner sample analysis, but he believes the principle is reliable and can be applied to many other cancers. \\"We have found there are over 30 molecule compounds in a tumor that are very smelly and easily sniffed. Eventually this can be used as a test for every cancer in the Western world,\\" he added. Around the world, similar approaches are being applied to offer simple diagnosis for the world's greatest killers. In 2011, the Gates Foundation announced funding for a battery-operated electronic nose prototype in India that functions as a breathalyzer test for tuberculosis. The \\"NaNose\\" is being developed by the Israeli Technion Institute, claiming 90% accuracy in detecting lung cancer from a breath test, and providing enough information to distinguish between subtypes of the disease. New generation. Electronic noses are not a new concept. Medical sensors first emerged in the 1980s, but were unable to deliver reliable diagnoses. But in this new generation of devices, experts believe the field has matured. \\"The idea been around for over 20 years with many companies making e-noses they thought would be useful for diagnosing diseases, but they were way oversold and that destroyed the idea for a time,\\" says Dr. Gary Beauchamp, director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Pennsylvania. \\"While the devices today don't come close to mimicking the nose of a dog, I'm confident that they will help to recognize diseases based on body odors.\\" Cancerous material can be found easily enough, says Beauchamp, but decoding the mass of combinations that form smells remains a difficulty. \\"Odors are a mixture of compounds and that requires pattern recognition. A dog recognizes an individual person through thousands of odors at one time, so you need a device that gives you the same information, and that is the challenge for the next generation.\\" In the short-term, Beauchamp believes that odor recognition could be used in conjunction with other tests, particularly as a means of non-invasive, early detection that could be followed up if necessary. \\"They could become part of a routine examination in much the same way as blood tests ... that seems to me a likely scenario.\\" There are fears that making diagnosis too widely available could take serious decisions out of the hands of experts, and that unreliable tools could proliferate. But similar techniques are already established outside of medicine, for a range of applications from testing for dangerous chemicals to quality control in food manufacturing. Companies are already moving toward consumer healthcare applications for the electronic nose. British start-up Owlstone is working on a mobile breath-testing system that would give users instant analysis of their breath, offering early detection of conditions such as diabetes, TB or cancers. NASA technology is also being researched as a mobile sensor for lung cancer. As molecular analysis becomes cheaper and more reliable the applications are rapidly expanding.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. In early 2014 Brandeis University in Massachusetts announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation commencement ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and lobbying by Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of \\"hate speech\\". University president Frederick M. Lawrence said that \\"certain of her past statements\\" were inconsistent with the university's \\"core values\\" because they were \\"Islamophobic.\\" Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision. The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future. The university's withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some. But, The Economist noted at the time that Hirsi Ali's \\"Wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren't done in American politics.\\" It said that \\"The explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious...\\" The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue, and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree. A Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis' action. Hirsi Ali said CAIR's letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet. She said that the \\"spirit of free expression\\" has been betrayed and stifled. David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence. Among the commenters, Jeffrey Herf, a Brandeis alumnus and historian, published an open letter criticizing Lawrence's decision, saying it had \\"done deep and long-lasting damage to a university.\\" Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, published an open letter saying that Lawrence \\"succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters.\\" Entity:","completion":"This text is about Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar, and former politician."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Between attending college classes at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and tutoring his fellow students, Jake is also working on a new theory about the creation of the universe. He happens to be 12 years old. From an early age, Jake showed an extraordinary interest in stars. When he was 3, his parents took him to a space observatory. He tried to learn as much as he could about astronomy. Jake's IQ measured remarkably high at 170. As a baby, Jake was found out with Asperser's syndrome, a form of autism . Autism causes difficulties in communication and social abilities. People with autism may also have strong interests--like Jake's interest in the stars at a young age. The symptoms of autism can range from mild to extremely severe. Asperser's is one of the milder forms of autism. Sometimes people with Asperser's, like Jake, develop extremely advanced skills in science, music or art. When Jake was in elementary school, his parents worried that the effects of his Asperser's were worsening. He became quiet. _ So a doctor recommended that Jake's parents let him study more advanced subjects, like math and physics. Jake's mother asked an astronomy professor to let Jake sit in on his class. Now, Jake studies advanced sciences like electromagnetic physics at IUPUI. But Jake thinks it's important to have a normal life too. He likes to play Guitar Hero with his friends and watch science fiction movies. He also enjoys playing classical music on the piano.But for Jake, studying physics is the most important thing. Jake's professor, John Ross, is working on getting a large sum of money for him to do research at the university. Doctors have said Jake's autism symptoms have lessened over time. Still, Jake proudly refers to himself as an \\"Aspy\\", or someone with Asperser's. In an interview with his university student newspaper, he said, \\"I think the autism is the reason I'm even at IUPUI.\\" 1. How old is Jake? 2. Whose theory might have a few mistakes? 3.

Article: A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state. Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations, for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture. Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system. Now answer this question: In what nation did the University Revolution occur?","completion":"The University Revolution occurred in Argentina. It was a series of events and reforms in 1918 that led to the transformation of the higher education system in the country, incorporating values that sought a more equal and secular system."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Waders are birds commonly found along shorelines and mudflats that wade in order to forage for food (such as insects or crustaceans) in the mud or sand. They are called shorebirds in North America (where \\"wader\\" is used to refer to long-legged wading birds such as storks and herons). Waders are members of the order Charadriiformes, which includes gulls, auks and their allies. - The coursers are a group of birds which together with the pratincoles make up the family Glareolidae. They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they inhabit deserts and similar arid regions. - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families. - Glareolidae is a family of birds in the wader suborder Charadri . It contains two distinct groups , the pratincoles and the coursers . The coursers include the atypical Egyptian plover , Pluvianus aegyptius , which has sometimes been placed in its own family . The family contains 17 species in five genera . - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest. - Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats, are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries. Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud, resulting from deposition of estuarine silts, clays and marine animal detritus. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily. - The Egyptian plover (\\"Pluvianus aegyptius\\"), also known as the crocodile bird, is a wader, the only member of the genus \\"Pluvianus\\". Formerly placed in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae, it is now regarded as the sole member of its own monotypic family Pluvianidae. - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha. - The herons are the long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, some of which are referred to as \\"egrets\\" or \\"bitterns\\" rather than herons. Members of the genera \\"Botaurus\\" and \\"Ixobrychus\\" are referred to as \\"bitterns\\", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus \\"Zebrilus\\", form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks. - An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. - The pratincoles or greywaders are a group of birds which together with the coursers and Egyptian plover make up the family Glareolidae. They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails. - Gulls, often referred to as seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.

The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of silent film \\"tragedies\\") Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norse versions of the story) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers. Also, I watched this film in German; I am a native English speaker and have a basic German knowledge.

Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. Context: Nurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \\"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\\" However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \\"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\\" In April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation. The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing, but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch, and the Associated Press wrote that \\"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\\" A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism. Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games. On 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25 miles) in 2:22:03.8 -- on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00, just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes. Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon. Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon. The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon. The Guardian reported that \\"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\\" and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury. Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War. Question: What sports did Nurmi practice? Answer:","completion":"Paavo Nurmi primarily practiced long-distance running, competing in various disciplines within the sport. Throughout his career, he focused on different distances, ranging from one mile to the marathon.

Grainy, black-and-white, and silent, a title \\"Once Upon a Time\\" leads to Latino labourers picking coffee beans while armed foremen push rudely between them. One worker (McDowell with black hair and moustache) pockets a few beans (\\"Coffee for the Breakfast Table\\") but is seen by a foreman. He is next seen before a fat Caucasian magistrate who loses some saliva as he removes his cigar only to say \\"Guilty.\\" The foreman pulls his machete and lays it across the unfortunate laborer's wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete lifts, descends, and we see McDowell draw back in a silent scream. The scene blacks out, the word NOW appears onscreen and expands quickly to fill it. During his journey, Travis learns the lesson, reinforced by numerous songs in the soundtrack by Alan Price, that he must abandon his principles in order to succeed, but unlike the other characters he meets he must retain a detached idealism that will allow him to distance himself from the evils of the world. Travis progresses from coffee salesman (working for Imperial Coffee in the North East of England and Scotland) to a victim of torture in a government installation and a medical research subject, under the supervision of Dr Millar. In parallel with Travis' experiences, the film shows 1960s Britain retreating from its imperial past, but managing to retain some influence in the world by means of corrupt dealings with foreign dictators. After finding out his girlfriend is the daughter of Sir James Burgess, an evil industrialist, he is appointed Burgess' personal assistant. With Dr Munda, the dictator of Zingara, a brutal police state which nevertheless manages to be a playground for wealthy people from the developed world, Burgess sells the regime a chemical called PL45 'Honey' for spraying on rebel areas (the effects resemble those of napalm).

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is the rotation of the Earth and its effects. Here is a detailed and long answer to the questions: The Earth rotates on an invisible axis, which is an imaginary line running from the North Pole to the South Pole. Earth's rotation refers to the spinning motion of the planet around this axis. This spinning takes approximately 24 hours to complete one full rotation, resulting in the cycle of day and night. The rotation of the Earth is caused by the conservation of angular momentum due to the formation of the solar system and the forces acted upon the planet billions of years ago. Earth's rotation can be better understood as the combined effect of two motions – axial rotation and orbital revolution. Axial rotation describes Earth's spinning around its axis, while orbital revolution refers to Earth's movement around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, taking approximately 365.2425 days to complete one full revolution. These two combined motions define the Earth's position in relation to other celestial bodies, impacting various phenomena on our planet. There are several significant effects of Earth's rotation: 1. Day and Night: The most apparent effect of Earth's rotation is the day and night cycle. As Earth rotates, different parts of the Earth's surface are exposed to sunlight at different times, effectively dividing the planet into two zones: a day side illuminated by sunlight, and a night side that is in shadow. 2. Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation: Earth's rotation also influences atmospheric and oceanic circulation, due to a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect. This effect causes air and water currents to be deflected in different directions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, resulting in distinct weather patterns and the formation of large-scale ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream, that significantly impact climate. 3. Time Zones: Earth's rotation is responsible for the establishment of time zones. As the Earth rotates, the Sun's position in the sky changes, and different parts of the planet experience local noon (when the Sun is at its highest point) at different moments. To standardize timekeeping, Earth is divided into 24 time zones, each corresponding to a 15-degree longitudinal slice of Earth's surface. 4. Earth's Shape: Earth's rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles. This phenomenon, known as an oblate spheroid shape, is a result of the centrifugal force generated by Earth's rotation, which pushes mass away from the axis and towards the equator. 5. Tidal Forces: As Earth rotates, it experiences the gravitational pull of the Moon, resulting in the rise and fall of ocean tides. The tidal forces created by this interaction cause the planet's rotation to gradually slow down. Over millions of years, Earth's rotation period has been increasing, though the change is minute and not noticeable on a human timescale. 6. Angular Momentum: The Earth's rotation conserves its angular momentum, ensuring that the planet's spin remains stable and consistent over time. The conservation of angular momentum is an essential factor in maintaining the Earth's climate, seasons, and overall stability in the solar system. In summary, Earth's rotation is a vital force that influences various aspects of life on the planet. Both questions inquire about the nature of Earth's rotation and its effects, which involve the day and night cycle, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, time zones, Earth's oblate spheroid shape, tidal forces, and the conservation of angular momentum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: (A). description (B). entity (C). abbreviation (D). human (E). numeric (F). location","completion":"The question \\"How large is Missouri's population?\\" is asking about a numeric entity. In detail: (A) Description: This option would be applicable if the question were asking for a qualitative aspect or a unique characteristic that defines Missouri. However, given that the question asks for its population, it does not fall under the category of description. (B) Entity: Although Missouri is an entity (it is a U.S. state), the question itself focuses on the population size rather than the state as a whole. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. (C) Abbreviation: The question does not involve any abbreviations, making this option irrelevant. (D) Human: The question does not pertain to an individual, so it is not related to a human. (E) Numeric: This is the correct choice. By asking \\"how large,\\" the question seeks a numeric value – in this case, the number of people living in Missouri. The information requested is, therefore, a numeric entity. (F) Location: Although Missouri is a location, the question is not focused on its geographical attributes, but rather on the population size. Thus, this option is not the correct answer.

Toru Takemitsu (Wu Man Che , Takemitsu Toru, October 8, 1930 - February 20, 1996) pronounced [takemitsW to:rW] was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. In 1948, Takemitsu conceived the idea of electronic music technology, or in his own words, to \\"bring noise into tempered musical tones inside a busy small tube.\\" During the 1950s, Takemitsu had learned that in 1948 \\"a French [engineer] Pierre Schaeffer invented the method(s) of musique concrete based on the same idea as mine. I was pleased with this coincidence.\\" In 1951, Takemitsu was a founding member of the anti-academic Jikken Kobo (Shi Yan Gong Fang , \\"experimental workshop\\"): an artistic group established for multidisciplinary collaboration on mixed-media projects, who sought to avoid Japanese artistic tradition. The performances and works undertaken by the group introduced several contemporary Western composers to Japanese audiences. During this period he wrote Saegirarenai Kyusoku I (\\"Uninterrupted Rest I\\", 1952: a piano work, without a regular rhythmic pulse or barlines); and by 1955 Takemitsu had begun to use electronic tape-recording techniques in such works as Relief Statique (1955) and Vocalism A*I (1956). Takemitsu also studied in the early 1950s with the composer Fumio Hayasaka, perhaps best known for the scores he wrote for films by Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa, the latter of whom Takemitsu would collaborate with decades later. In the late 1950s chance brought Takemitsu international attention: his Requiem for string orchestra (1957 listen ), written as an homage to Hayasaka, was heard by Igor Stravinsky in 1958 during his visit to Japan. (The NHK had organised opportunities for Stravinsky to listen to some of the latest Japanese music; when Takemitsu's work was put on by mistake, Stravinsky insisted on hearing it to the end.) At a press conference later, Stravinsky expressed his admiration for the work, praising its \\"sincerity\\" and \\"passionate\\" writing. Stravinsky subsequently invited Takemitsu to lunch; and for Takemitsu this was an \\"unforgettable\\" experience. After Stravinsky returned to the U.S., Takemitsu soon received a commission for a new work from the Koussevitsky Foundation which, he assumed, had come as a suggestion from Stravinsky to Aaron Copland. For this he composed Dorian Horizon, (1966), which was premiered by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Copland.

Article: Huawei isn’t just promoting a new phone, the flashy new Ascend P7. The Chinese technology giant is also trying to get people to start taking “groufies.” As you can already tell, this is a clumsy portmanteau meaning group selfie, often known simply as a “photo.” Company executives unveiled the new term in Paris Wednesday to show off the Ascend P7′s fancy new camera that allows for panoramic photos — that is, you can tilt the camera back and forth to capture more than just your outstretched arm, head and shoulders and include some of the background or other people you’re with. It’s a cool technology, as far as it goes, but will any sane person take such photos with friends and call them groufies? Huawei certainly seems to think it will catch on, and the company has even filed a trademark application for the word, according to the Wall Street Journal. Groufie is only the latest neologism Silicon Valley has tried to force on the rest of us. Previous hits include phablet, vlogging and any of the new “smart” devices being peddled these days. But a phone with a large screen doesn’t need its own name, and sometimes a “smart fridge” is just a fridge with Wi-Fi. If new technologies require new words, it usually happens naturally. Think tablets and laptops. But when a company tries to force its silly trademarked buzzwords into the language, it just looks desperate. ||||| Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei has filed an application to register “groufie” as a trademark in several countries in an attempt to coin a term for a panoramic self-portrait. The word \\"selfie\\" broke into common usage last year, referring to a self-portrait taken with a mobile phone at arms length. Now comes the \\"groufie\\". Huawei latest phone has a higher quality front-facing camera than most competitors, as well as software that allows users to take panoramic images with it. The company makes the point that a \\"selfie\\" taken of a group often totally blocks out the scenery and location, and suggests that panoramic images in the same situation would capture more context. The company has applied for trademark protection for the term in China, France, Germany, Russia and the US, although applications are still pending. Huawei's Ascend P7 smartphone was launched at an event in Paris on Wednesday, where the term \\"groufie\\" was first used in public. The handset has an eight mega pixel front camera and an image processing chip more usually found in DSLR cameras. The feature is simple to use and works well enough, as long as nothing is moving in the background. It is clear that the phone has been designed with the selfie in mind: an \\"auto beauty enhancement\\" feature aims to process images before uploading to social media sites, although it does just tend to blur a bit as you ramp-up your \\"beauty level\\" from zero to six. There's even a small preview window on the camera screen, near to the lens, so that your line of sight appears to be straight into the camera, even though you're checking your appearance. It's all very well thought out. Huawei's new Ascend P7, featuring a \\"groufie\\" panoramic camera ||||| The 2013 word of the year, selfie, now has a younger sibling: groufie. The word -- it means just what it sounds like, a group selfie -- is a bit awkward, but that may be because it was coined by the marketers of the world's No. 3 smartphone maker, Huawei of China. They must have been extra careful to avoid associations with unruly rock bands and their camp followers. For their contribution to the English language, the folks at Huawei used the same method that produced \\"selfie\\", known as hypocoristics. It'spopular in Australia, turning a mosquito into a mozzie and, indeed, an Austrialian into an Aussie. \\"Selfie\\" was born spontaneously, reflecting our phones' transfiguration into connected cameras. \\"Groufie\\", registered as a trademark in China, France, Germany, Russia and the U.S., also reflects a nascent trend: smartphones' front-facing cameras, once mainly useful for videochatting, are getting more powerful, making it possible to produce high-quality group portraits. And, of course, the best possible selfies. Sony the market leader in imaging sensors -- makes the hardware for the rear-facing cameras in the iPhone, and was Samsung's main supplier before it developed its own sensors for the Galaxy S5 -- says it's opened up a whole new market. Huawei is the front-runner. Its Asscend P7 phone, launched on Wednesday, has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, just like the iPhone's main one. The competition is hot on its heels. HTC recently released its One M8, with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Microsoft, the new owner of Nokia's handset business, is working on a phone with similar specs. Fast-growing, low-cost Chinese producer Xiaomi's next flagship device, the Mi3S, with an 8-megapixel screen-side camera, is about to debut on May 15. Even Apple, which has until recently snubbed the megapixel race, leaving it to Nokia and the Chinese producers, is rumored to be contemplating the use of a Sony high-resolution front-facing camera in iPhone 6. All for the perfect selfie. It may seem that as smartphone makers face a technological dead end, they are clutching at straws, seeking an advantage in the gauchest features imaginable. Not so: selfies are important. By October 2013 (the last month for which data are available) 35 million of them had been uploaded to Instagram. A U.K. poll last year showed that it was the most popular genre of photography among people aged 18 to 24, accounting for 30 percent of all pictures taken. Selfies are the most widespread form of content sent over SnapChat, the younger generation's preferred communication tool. Selfies fuel social media campaigns and ruin lives: posting too many of them is supposed to be bad for your real-world relationships, and a recent study by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that they drive up demand for nose jobs and hair transplants. We are used to marketers pushing us into consumption patterns that are not natural for us. The word \\"groufie\\" looks like a perfect example of a marketing-driven trend. In this case, hardware makers are not inventing a disease to fit a cure: The selfie boom is real, and it's a wonder that the smartphone producers have waited so long to jump on the bandwagon. In fact, Huawei's linguistic exercise may carry within it a subtle suggestion for a cure. If you have to overuse your powerful screen-side camera, at least take a picture of yourself with some friends, or even with a bunch of strangers. Self-obsession may be marketable, but it's not particularly healthy. To contact the author of this article: Leonid Bershidsky at lbershidsky@bloomberg.net.

Here is a news article: For a dozen years, the Palm Beach County School District insisted that four third-grade girls bore responsibility for allowing their teacher to molest them in 2005. In court documents, the district said the children were “old enough to appreciate the consequences of their actions.” An outside lawyer hired by the district even called it a standard legal defense, which the district had used since 2006. The district said in February court papers that the 9-year-old girls “conducted themselves in a careless and negligent manner,” which contributed to any suffering. The students claimed emotional distress and other injuries after former teacher Blake Sinrod molested them in 2005 at Coral Sunset Elementary, west of Boca Raton. The defense was drafted by the Hollywood law firm Conroy Simberg. School Board member Erica Whitfield said a school district attorney who handles risk management cases reviewed it. Handout Blake Sinrod was arrested in 2005. Blake Sinrod was arrested in 2005. (Handout) But school district administrators would not directly address who reviewed the case. Superintendent Robert Avossa referred questions to the Hollywood law firm. Whitfield and School Board members Karen Brill, Debra Robinson and Frank Barbieri said the district was wrong to suggest the students might somehow be at fault. “I don't think a child can ever consent to being sexually abused,” said Barbieri, whose district includes Coral Sunset. School Board members Chuck Shaw, Marcia Andrews and Barbara McQuinn did not respond to phone calls on Wednesday, but the school district released a statement attributed to the School Board. \\"The board, with its attorneys, must consider all legal defenses on a case-by-case basis. However, this current School Board has never taken the position that a child could be implicit in their own child abuse,” the statement reads. It took 12 years for the district to decide whether it bore any responsibility in the case involving Sinrod, who pleaded guilty to molesting two of the children in 2006. Sinrod was fired in 2006 and his teaching license was revoked in 2008. He could not be reached for comment. The School Board is expected to approve a 3.6 million settlement — one of its largest ever — at an Oct. 18 meeting. Conroy Simberg has worked on the case since 2006 and its filings have always included the same language about the children being old enough to take responsibility, said Dale Friedman, an attorney with the firm. She said the defense is called “comparative negligence,” and it’s used in court filings before all the facts are known. She said the purpose was not to claim the girls were responsible, but to bring up factors that could reduce the amount of damages the district might have to pay. For example, she said the former students chose not to get psychological treatment. “We have never blamed these girls or given the appearance of holding the girls responsible for what their teacher did,’ she said. She said this defense is common but declined to name other cases in which it was used. Jeffrey Herman, a Boca Raton lawyer who has represented clients in about 1,000 sexual abuse cases, said he doesn’t recall this negligence defense being used against any abused children he represented. He said it’s more common for organizations accused of sexual abuse to lay blame on parents, claiming they failed to protect their children. “The real problem with this [defense] is it revictimizes the victims,” he said. “There’s meaning and impact when you file things. It’s forever part of the permanent record that the School Board is blaming these third-graders.” Board member Debra Robinson said there may be valid reasons to use this defense, but this wasn’t one of them. “I can’t imagine right now the circumstances by which an elementary child is partially responsible,” Robinson said. School Board member Brill said: “It is my intent to ensure that this type of defense is never, ever used again in the district. The board had no knowledge that this was the manner in which the school district was going to defend the case, and in no way is it appropriate. I think we’re all outraged.’’ School police investigated Sinrod in 2005, when one of the girls told her mother that the teacher had fondled her during a reading group. The girl said he touched her under her clothing and instructed her to touch his private area over his clothing, according to a police report. The three other girls painted similar pictures to police. They described Sinrod inappropriately touching them during a reading group or classroom movie. Some of the girls said they gave him neck rubs, and some said Sinrod instructed them to place their hand on his genital area outside his clothes, according to a police report. School police determined there was enough evidence to charge Sinrod in all four cases, although the State Attorney’s Office pursued only allegations involving two of the girls. Sinrod pleaded guilty but adjudication was withheld after he met conditions of his probation, according to court records. The parents of the four children filed a civil suit in 2006. Their lawyer at the time, Charles Bechert, said then that the parents believed Sinrod targeted the children because they were immigrants whose parents may not have known how to report crimes to authorities. The case has gone through several amendments and appeals since then. In February, after another brief in the case was filed, the school district hired a forensic psychologist to examine the victims. He concluded the former students, who are now adults, were telling the truth, Friedman said. “As the facts became clear, we recommended a settlement,” Friedman said. If the case had gone to trial, she said, the firm would have advised against using the defense that the students were negligent. In another part of its defense, the district argued that Sinrod’s actions were “unknown and beyond the foresight of reasonably prudent persons.” However, the parents’ lawsuit says another parent had complained to a Coral Sunset assistant principal in 2003 about a similar incident involving a second-grade girl but was told the daughter must be lying. Marc Wites, the lawyer for the four girls, argued the school district failed to investigate or take action against Sinrod when the 2003 allegations surfaced. stravis@sunsentinel.com, 561-243-6637 or Twitter @smtravis ||||| A Florida school district is expected this week to approve a 3.6 million settlement in a years-long lawsuit brought by four third-grade girls who said they were molested by a teacher in 2005. But that move comes after the district’s outside law firm once appeared to blame the children, in part, for their own sexual abuse. (A lawyer with the firm reportedly disputes this characterization.) The four girls — each about 9 years old at the time — said that their teacher, Blake Sinrod, had groped them and forced them to touch him, according to the suit. Sinrod pleaded guilty in May 2006 to child abuse charges involving two of his students, records show. Prosecutors declined to pursue cases involving the third and fourth students, the Sun Sentinel reports. Sinrod was fired in 2006 and his teaching license was revoked in 2008, according to the newspaper. Adjudication of his abuse charges was reportedly withheld after he satisfied the terms of his probation. When the girls’ parents allegedly discovered other accusations against the same teacher, they sued the Palm Beach School District in 2006 for negligence. But in court filings obtained by PEOPLE, lawyers for the school district claimed that the children themselves were negligent and contributed to the molestation. “The Plaintiffs were old enough to appreciate the consequences of their own actions and to be held accountable for them,” the school district wrote in one answer in 2010. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

The case has moved slowly for more than a decade, eventually ending up in the Florida Supreme Court. Last week, the parties agreed to a 3.6 million settlement, which is expected to be approved by the school board this week. Representatives from the school district were not immediately available for comment. “I would just say that it’s unfortunate that it took 11 years of litigation to bring this case to a conclusion,” the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Marc Wites, tells PEOPLE. “An appeals process was happening simultaneously, so this took a very long time.” Wites says that the four girls, now adults, have been working to move forward from their abuse. “It’s hard for this to come back into the news again,” he says. “But they’re trying to look at it in a positive light: This is the end of the lawsuit; they can move on. But they’ll still have to live with this for the rest of their lives.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Once upon a time, some very bad things happened at a school in a place called Palm Beach County. A teacher named Blake Sinrod did something very, very wrong to four of his third-grade girls in the year 2005. This is something no one should ever do, and it made the girls and their families very sad and upset. The people in charge of the school, called the school district, tried to say that these young girls were somehow to blame for what happened. They thought that because the girls were 9 years old, they should have known better and should have done something to stop the bad things from happening. This is what they said in court when the girls' parents took them there to ask for help. But, lots of people didn't agree with the school district. They said, \\"No way, a child can never be blamed for such a bad thing happening to them!\\" Even some of the people on the School Board, who help run the school district, said they disagreed with blaming the girls. It took a very long time, twelve years in fact, for the school district to decide that maybe they had some blame in this bad thing happening too. They finally decided to give the girls and their families money to help with all the sadness and trouble this has caused. They are giving a very big amount of 3.6 million dollars. So, even though it took a very long time and there was a lot of arguing, in the end, the big people realized that it was not right to blame the little girls for the bad things that happened to them at school. And they promised they would never, ever try to do the same thing again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ulick's father was from an Anglo-Norman family who had been long settled in the west of Ireland and had become Gaelicised. Although during the early sixteenth century the family had rebelled against the Crown on several occasions, Ulick's father had been a strong supporter of Queen Elizabeth I. He fought on the Queen's side during Tyrone's Rebellion, notably during the victory at the Battle of Kinsale, where he was wounded. After the war he married the widow of The 2nd Earl of Essex, a recent commander in Ireland, who was the daughter of the English Secretary of State and spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham. In 1622, Ulick married his only wife Anne Compton, the daughter of The 1st Earl of Northampton and his wife, Elizabeth Spencer. They had a single child, Margaret Burgh, who married Viscount Muskerry. Ulick was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Burgh in 1628, and succeeded his father as 5th Earl of Clanricarde in 1635. In 1636, he inherited Somerhill House on the death of his father. He was a staunch opponent of the policies of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, The 1st Earl of Strafford, who had attempted to seize much of the great Burke inheritance for the Crown; there was also personal ill-feeling between the two men since the dispute was thought by many to have hastened the death of Ulick's elderly father.

Draw patterns on the disc itself or glue on glitter to complete the decoration. Stick CD labels on your discs to lend more space for decoration. While whole discs can be used in crafts, you'll have far more possibilities if you break them up. Breaking them up, you can create a number of different shapes and increase the reflective surface of the disc. Snap the CD into multiple shards and glue onto a surface for a striking mosaic. If you're breaking CDs, keep the sharp edges in mind. Be careful when you're snapping the discs. Use a hammer to break up smaller pieces and pick up broken sharps gently, as if they were glass. CDs are the perfect size to set hot drinks atop. They will bear the heat and save your kitchen surfaces from damage. You can paint or draw on the discs to give them some ornamental appeal as well.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -j + 2 = 4 for j, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Isolate the variable (j) on one side of the equation. To do this, we want to move the constant on the left side of the equation to the right side. We can achieve this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: -j + 2 - 2 = 4 - 2 -j = 2 Step 2: Now, in order to isolate j, we need to get rid of the negative sign in front of j. To do this, multiply or divide both sides of the equation by -1. In this case, we'll divide, so: (-j) / (-1) = 2 / (-1) This simplifies to: j = -2 So, the solution is j = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Passage: On 1 March 1849, Brown was charged with the murder of \\"unknown aboriginal natives\\". In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident, discussed in Brown's presence. Brown's co-accused, Eastwood, alias \\"Yorkie\\", had fled when the investigation began and had apparently left the colony aboard a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. An important witness named Joice had gone to the neighbouring Port Phillip District of the colony of New South Wales, and Leandermin himself, who it appears was being detained at Guichen Bay, absconded and had allegedly been \\"made away with\\". The remaining witnesses were those that knew Brown, and apparently would not give evidence against him. Despite the extremely difficult task faced by the prosecution under these circumstances, the Advocate General ordered that investigations continue and issued warrants for the arrest of those that had fled South Australia. Brown appeared at the Supreme Court yet again on 10 and 28 September, but the judge again refused to hear the case without further evidence. By the November sittings of the court, Brown's case had been removed from the listings, and this was the end of the matter as far as the formal investigation was concerned. Effectively, settler solidarity and the law of evidence ensured that Brown was never tried for the murders, despite the fact that those involved in the investigation had no doubt of his guilt. Possibly in response to Brown's case, the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 was amended in July 1849 to allow a person to be convicted on the sole testimony of an Aboriginal person.

Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn.

Since the inmates have been detained indefinitely without trial and several inmates were severely tortured, this camp is considered as a major breach of human rights by great parts of the world. - Military tactics are the science and art of organizing a military force, and the techniques for combining and using weapons and military units to engage and defeat an enemy in battle. Changes in philosophy and technology have been reflected in changes to military tactics. In contemporary military science, tactics are the lowest of three planning levels: (i) strategic, (ii) operational, and (iii) tactical. The highest level of planning is strategy: how force is translated into political objectives by bridging the means and ends of war. The intermediate level, operational, the conversion of strategy into tactics, deals with formations of units. In the vernacular, tactical decisions are those made to achieve the greatest immediate value; strategic decisions are those made to achieve the greatest overall value, irrespective of the immediate results of a tactical decision. - The Arab world ('; formally: '), also known as the Arab nation (\\"\\"), consists of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries of the Arab League.

Given the context of your question - that the cause of myocarditis cannot reproduce by themselves - it seems that you might be looking for an explanation of how the inflammation occurs. In the case of viral myocarditis, the viruses cannot reproduce by themselves; they need a host cell to reproduce. When a virus infects cells within the heart muscle, it replicates within those cells and can cause the immune system to respond, leading to inflammation and damage to the heart muscle.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Get on the Bus Context: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is an openly racist and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a police officer, is the sole biracial man on the bus; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to confrontations; the only topic of unity is the O.J. Simpson trial, with the men agreeing that, while Simpson is probably guilty, his acquittal is justified as his victims were a white woman and a Jew. Peace is kept through the various verbal arguments and physical altercations that occur by Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group. Jeremiah, an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life by embracing his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by a ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. Several of the passengers harass Rick with antisemitic remarks and jokes; Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan.

Article: Jumping on your bike, even in the city, is becoming increasingly popular--- in London, for example, cycle use has more than doubled in the past ten years. So, which is the best bike for you? If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure . For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous. Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300. A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350. For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500. Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards aren't always included. Question: According to the passage, which kind of bike is least likely to be stolen? Answer: Available choices: A). A road bike. B).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. Paragraph: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire? A:","completion":"Given the paragraph above, the area with higher wind speeds at the time of the fire would be Texas. Since it is currently daytime in Texas, there would be an increase in temperature, lower humidity, and increased wind speeds, which contribute to greater wildfire intensity. On the other hand, Seattle has its wildfire at nighttime, during which the land cools, and wind speeds generally decrease as air currents travel downhill. As a result, the Texas wildfire would likely experience higher wind speeds at the time of the fire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the difference between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments? What is difference between moving coil and moving iron ammeter? Do those questions have the same meaning? Options: A. no. B. yes.","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first explain the differences between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments, and then compare the two given questions to determine if they have the same meaning. Step 1: Explain Moving-Iron Instruments: Moving-iron instruments are measuring devices that use the magnetic attraction between a fixed coil and a moving piece of iron to measure electrical current, voltage, or power. When an alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field causes the moving iron piece to be attracted towards the coil, and the resulting movement is proportional to the strength of the current or voltage being measured. The movement is usually indicated by a pointer on a calibrated scale. Step 2: Explain Moving-Coil Instruments: Moving-coil instruments, also called permanent-magnet moving-coil (PMMC) instruments, are measuring devices that work based on the interaction of the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying coil and the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a pivot and allowed to rotate freely within the magnetic field. When an electric current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field, which interacts with the permanent magnet's field. The resulting torque causes the coil to rotate, moving a pointer across a calibrated scale. Moving-coil instruments are generally designed to measure direct current (DC) only. Step 3: Determine Differences: The main differences between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments are as follows: 1. Moving-iron instruments can measure both AC and DC, while moving-coil instruments are mainly designed to measure DC. 2. Moving-iron instruments use the magnetic attraction between a coil and a moving piece of iron, while moving-coil instruments use the interaction between the magnetic field produced by the coil and the field of a permanent magnet. Step 4: Compare Questions: Question 1: \\"What is the difference between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments?\\" Question 2: \\"What is the difference between moving coil and moving iron ammeter?\\" Now, I'll analyze the meanings of these questions. The first question is asking for the general differences between the two types of instruments. The second question appears to narrow the scope to specifically focus on ammeters, which are used to measure current. However, since both moving-iron and moving-coil ammeters still rely on the principles inherent to their respective instrument types, the essential differences explained earlier still apply. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, option B (yes) is the correct answer. The two questions have the same meaning, as both ask for the differences between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments, and the principles explained earlier apply to both general instruments and ammeters."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is a question about this article: When comparing different documents, or \\"witnesses\\", of a single, original text, the observed differences are called variant readings, or simply variants or readings. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be un-original, hence establishing a \\"critical text\\", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both \\"external\\" evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and \\"internal\\" or \\"physical\\" considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).

Given the question: It's not every week that England's greatest playwright William Shakespeare hits the headlines, but the Bard of Avon has been the subject of two news stories in recent days as new information has come to light about the writer and his working environment. In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London. The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death. The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was. Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare. Mr Cobhe immediately realized he was looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. The painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. In a separate story, archaeologists in London believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre.

Let's break down the sentiment of each part of the tweet to better understand: 1. \\"@TeamTSwift\\": This part refers to the Twitter handle for Team Taylor Swift. Mentioning a specific fan account implies that the user prefers Taylor Swift or has positive sentiments towards her, but it is not the central focus of this tweet. 2. \\"I would follow Team Lovato\\": This part suggests that the user has an interest in or liking for Demi Lovato, as they are considering following the fan account (Team Lovato). There is a positive sentiment in this portion of the tweet, indicating the user's genuine interest in Demi Lovato. 3. \\"but they tweet sooooo much\\": The use of the word \\"but\\" signals a contrast from the previous positive sentiment. The user finds the high volume of tweets from Team Lovato overwhelming or annoying. The use of multiple \\"o\\"s in \\"sooooo\\" serves as an emphasis to show their exacerbated frustration with the account's tweeting frequency. From the analysis of each part of the tweet, it can be concluded that the overall sentiment is mildly negative, with the user expressing their frustration about the excessive number of tweets from Team Lovato. At the same time, it conveys their preference for Team Taylor Swift and their genuine interest in Demi Lovato. However, the primary sentiment is directed towards the frustration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you pray for someone?","completion":"Praying for someone is a thoughtful and compassionate act that displays concern and care for the well-being of another individual. It involves invoking a higher power or divinity (usually God) to bring comfort, guidance, protection, or blessings to that person. Different religious and spiritual practices have various methodologies and guidelines for praying for others, primarily rooted in their respective belief systems. However, there is a general structure that can be followed, regardless of one's faith or spiritual inclination. 1. Prepare mentally and emotionally: Find a quiet and comfortable space where you can concentrate, away from any distractions. Take a moment to clear your mind, and focus on the person for whom you'll be praying. Reflect on their needs, problems, and desires, and try to empathize with their situation. 2. Select a format: Some people prefer to vocalize their prayers, while others enjoy engaging in silent or written prayers. Choose the format that feels the most natural and comfortable for you. Remember, there is no one correct way to pray, and your intentions are more important than the specific words you choose. 3. Choose a higher power: If you belong to a specific religious tradition, you may want to address your prayer to the deity or deities associated with that faith. If you are spiritual but not religious, you can pray to the Universe, the collective consciousness, or a divine energy. Alternatively, you can direct your prayer to a loved one who has passed on and may be able to offer help from the other side. 4. Begin with an invocation: Open the prayer by addressing the higher power you've chosen, expressing your gratitude and faith in their ability to provide help, comfort, or guidance. This could be in the form of a formal salutation or a simple conversation-starter. 5. State your intention: Clearly articulate the reasons for your prayer. Mention the person you're praying for, their situation, and any specific requests you'd like to make on their behalf. When you pray for someone else, focus on their well-being, drawing on empathy and compassion to convey your desires for their happiness, health, and safety. 6. Offer thanks and gratitude: Acknowledge the power of the higher force or divine energy for the blessings and help they provide. Express gratitude for the positive aspects of the person's life, recognizing the growth and lessons they've experienced along the way. 7. Close the prayer: Depending on your chosen higher power or religious tradition, use an appropriate closing phrase or affirmation. This may include saying \\"Amen,\\" \\"Om,\\" \\"So Mote It Be,\\" \\"In Jesus' Name,\\" \\"In the Name of Allah,\\" or another culturally or spiritually appropriate phrase to conclude your prayer. 8. Send positive energy: After concluding the prayer, take a moment to visualize the person you prayed for surrounded by light, love, and positive energy. Trust that the higher power you invoked will provide the necessary help, guidance, or blessings to the person in need. 9. Continue supporting the person: Praying for someone is not a one-time act. Often, the most significant impact comes from maintaining your support, concern, and communication with the person in need. Follow up with them, offer assistance when possible, and genuinely engage with their experiences and emotions when they share them with you. 10. Reflect and meditate: Lastly, spend a few moments in quiet reflection or meditation to internalize the positive energy and intentions you've set for the person. This practice can strengthen your empathy, connection, and positive intentions even further. Throughout this process, remember that prayer is an intensely personal and subjective activity. The most important aspect of praying for someone is to approach the practice with genuine compassion, love, and the profound desire for the well-being of the person you are praying for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was known for his kind heart, unwavering determination, and the never-ending quest to improve himself. Oliver had grand dreams of becoming a successful businessman, creating a company that would improve the lives of people in his town and beyond. To achieve this lofty ambition, he spent all his waking hours focused on sharpening his skills and researching innovative ideas. Oliver's best friend, Nathan, was equally committed to his own goals and dreams. From the early days of their childhood, the two friends shared a bond that only grew stronger with each passing year. Nathan had a knack for inventing, and his creative mind had already begun earning him a reputation as a remarkable innovator. One sunny morning, Oliver received a letter from an esteemed business school, inviting him to participate in a prestigious business plan competition. Excited and determined to win, he couldn't wait to share the news with Nathan. Upon hearing about this incredible opportunity, Nathan offered his full support and promised to provide any assistance he could. Oliver spent countless hours perfecting his business plan and meticulously analyzing each aspect to ensure success. His energy and enthusiasm never faltered, but as the competition approached, doubts started creeping into his mind. With each day, he became more anxious, losing sleep and feeling perpetually unprepared. It was then that Nathan stepped in and offered some much-needed advice. Oliver, usually fiercely independent, was initially reluctant to accept guidance from his friend. He believed that he had to do everything on his own to prove his worth. However, Nathan's persistent counsel, sharing his insights, and encouragement made Oliver realize that he wasn't on this journey alone. Taking Nathan's advice to heart, Oliver made significant revisions to his business plan, resulting in a well-thought-out and structured proposal that perfectly showcased his vision. Subsequently, the competition day arrived, and with his friend by his side, he stepped onto the stage with renewed confidence. Each contestant showcased extraordinary talent, and the judges appeared to be in awe of the business plans they had seen. The room was charged with tense energy as the judges huddled together to make their final decision. After several long minutes, the panel declared the winner – and it was none other than Oliver! Overwhelmed with emotion, he gratefully hugged Nathan, thanking him profusely for providing unwavering guidance, encouragement, and support. Oliver knew that, without his friend's help, he wouldn't have achieved this monumental milestone. Oliver's dream of establishing a business that would make a difference in people's lives had become a tangible possibility, thanks to Nathan's caring and invaluable advice. As they prepared to leave the event, arm in arm, the sun setting on the horizon, it was evident that Oliver was grateful to his friend, beyond any doubt or measure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Comparing two women!

The singer also struck a hopeful chord, waxing positive about female unity being “stronger than ever.” “We have an understanding and respect for one another,” she said. “More than trump can say about anyone, his fellow candidates, other races and religions , other public figures , just HUMAN BEINGS in general, and of course animals! Check out his family hunting photos!!!!” “It’s absolute insanity that this has gone on this long and far!” she finished. “Wake me up from this nightmare someone PLEASE!” The offending meme was just one battle in the two candidates’ asinine war of the wives, which began Tuesday when Trump incorrectly accused Cruz’s camp of putting out a shaming ad featuring nearly-nude Melania, ridiculing the notion that she could be “your next First Lady.” The idiotic spat raged on all week, with Trump vaguely threatening to “spill the beans” on Heidi Cruz and the Texas senator channeling Michael Douglas in “The American President” to trash Trump in a CNN interview. The feud boiled over Friday when Cruz blamed the thin-skinned tycoon for orchestrating a sordid National Enquirer exclusive alleging he'd bedded five young mistresses.

Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork that comes from various parts of the pig, most typically from the pork belly or from the less fatty back cuts. It is a popular food in the Unites States and the United Kingdom. The process of barding involves wrapping a piece of meat with a layer of fat before cooking to keep it moist. Similarly, larding is a cooking technique where you insert strips of fat into a piece of meat to enhance its flavor. This is particularly useful for cooking game meats like venison or pheasant, which are lean and can become dry when cooked. Bacon, because of its high fat content, can indeed be used for barding and larding.

Let's break down the given premise and hypothesis: Premise: 1. Tinsley credited God for his abilities. 2. Lafferty reacted to the tie with the same sort of aplomb that he would have displayed if he'd lost. Hypothesis: Tinsley said he had honed the skill all on his own. Given the premise, we understand that Tinsley believes his abilities to be the result of divine intervention or a gift from God. Since Tinsley attributes his abilities to an external source, it means he acknowledges that he did not solely develop his skills on his own. Considering the hypothesis, it proposes that Tinsley claimed to have honed the skill independently without any external influence or assistance. This directly contradicts Tinsley's acknowledgment of God playing a role in developing his abilities, which is stated in the premise. Therefore, based on the premise, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true, as it presents a contradictory statement to the information provided in the premise. The premise suggests that Tinsley credits God for his abilities, while the hypothesis implies he honed these skills on his own, which cannot be true simultaneously."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Akers successfully converted all three of his first-half field goal attempts, the longest from 37 yards out. Robbie Gould was one for two, and the score was 9-3 Philadelphia at halftime. The Bears took the ball to the Eagles' one-yard line on their first drive of the third quarter, but settled for a field goal. Gould connected for two more field goals early in the fourth quarter to tie the game, then put the Bears ahead 12-9. On their ensuing possession, Donovan McNabb guided the Eagles down the field and fired a touchdown pass to tight end Matt Schobel, putting Philadelphia back on top 16-12 with less than five minutes to play. The Eagles forced a three and out, but their offense could not kill the clock. Chicago got the ball back with less than two minutes left and Brian Griese, with his headset broken, commanded his own drive, marching his team down the field, completing the winning touchdown pass to Muhsin Muhammad with nine seconds remaining.

Tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. During the Vedic period, several small republics known as \\"Janapada\\" existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles.

And one of them is the Holiday Inn Hotel, with rooms built around a swimming pool and a friendly atmosphere. The Holiday Inn is where Manhattan people often go for a special party, or a night out. A lot of them choose to eat in the bright-lit restaurant near the pool, And many of them will be served by Ellen Logan, who has worked as a waitress here for more than two years. Ellen, like most of the waitresses, is also a student. She comes from Nebraska, but she's planning one day to be a veterinary surgeon, and to care for small animals. But in order to support herself at college, she works twenty hours a week at the Holiday Inn. Ellen soon learned what every waitress finds out. Your best friend has a good pair of shoes. She paid forty-five dollars for hers, much more than she would usually spend. She's discovered something else too. You don't have to know much about food to be a good waitress, but you do have to know a lot about people. \\"A lot of business people always stay here when they come to Manhattan\\", she explains. \\"They like you to recognize them and remember their favorite dishes. But some couples come for a night out together. They just want to be left alone. Then there are people who can't make up their minds. They look down the menu and say,'What do you suggest?'So I ask them how hungry they are. If they say,'Not very.'I suggest the salad bar, with soup, salad, bread, and a fruit plate. But if they say they're very hungry, I suggest a Kansas Strip Steak, with potatoes or rice. You get salad and bread as well. It's very nice. Real good value\\". Ellen may get tired sometimes, but at least she's learning too much about people. She's learning too much about people. She'll probably make a good animal doctor, but if she finds she doesn't like it after all, she can become a psychiatrist instead. Question: Choose the best title for the passage.

The narrative mainly revolves around the character of Ellen Logan, her responsibilities, and experiences as a waitress at the Holiday Inn in Manhattan, Kansas. This title encapsulates the central character and location, making it clear to potential readers about the main focus of the piece. Nonetheless, it could be argued that the title doesn't fully encapsulate other subtle themes of the article such as the contrast of Ellen's career aspirations (veterinary surgeon and potential psychiatrist) versus her current job, the unique dynamics of the hotel environment, or the human interactions and insights she gains from her role. Therefore, while \\"Ellen Logan at the Holiday Inn\\" could work as a title, alternative suggestions that further capture the depth and details of the narrative might include \\"Ellen Logan: Student, Waitress, Future Vet\\", \\"Waiting Tables and Understanding People: A Tale from the Holiday Inn\\", or \\"Inside the Holiday Inn: Ellen's Journey Through Work and School\\".

A leak in a boat.","completion":"While the word \\"leak\\" in both of these sentences refers to the unintended escape or release of a substance, the substances and implications involved in each situation are distinct. In this context, \\"leak\\" serves to describe two similar, yet distinct, occurrences. In the first sentence – \\"A leak in a gas pipe\\" – the word \\"leak\\" refers to the escape of gas from a pipe. This type of leak could involve natural gas, propane, or any other type of gaseous substance that should ideally remain confined within the pipe. A gas leak poses significant hazards, such as the risk of an explosion, fire, and potential exposure to toxic or flammable gases. It is crucial to address gas leaks promptly and effectively to ensure safety and prevent damage to property and the environment. Meanwhile, in the second sentence – \\"A leak in a boat\\" – the word \\"leak\\" signifies the process of water infiltrating the boat, typically through a crack or hole in the boat's structure. This kind of leak is often associated with the risk of sinking or damaging the boat, potentially affecting its buoyancy, stability, and general safety. A water leak in a boat also necessitates prompt identification and repair to avert potential catastrophes, secure the boat's integrity, and protect its occupants. In summary, although the word \\"leak\\" implies an unintended escape or release of a substance in both sentences, the specific substances involved and the implications of each leakage differ significantly. In one instance, \\"leak\\" pertains to the release of gas from a pipe, while in the other, it refers to water leakage in a boat.

Senator Schumer further emphasized that the pain persists for those who lost their loved ones in the Lockerbie bombing. He called upon the Scottish and British governments to formally acknowledge their mistake in releasing Al Megrahi and to ensure that such an injustice is not repeated in the future. Moreover, Schumer also stressed the importance of continued efforts to bring the other conspirators involved in the Lockerbie attack to justice, as numerous investigations have pointed to the possibility of multiple parties being responsible for the tragic event. In conclusion, the families of the Lockerbie bombing victims continue to seek justice and closure even after Abdelbaset Al Megrahi's death.

Jin-tae Lee owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education. Jin-tae also bought a silver pen for Jin-seok. Jin-tae's fiancÃ©e Young-shin works with the Lee's noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea. Both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They then become a part of the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Pusan Perimeter and then advancing north. Jin-tae is told by his commanding officer that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae willingly volunteers for many dangerous missions and is quickly promoted to the rank of Chungsa (Sergeant). His heroic feats during the urban battle of Pyongyang finally result in Jin-tae being nominated for the medal. His combat experiences quickly brutalize him into a cold-blood ruthless killer, which worries his horrified younger brother. The U.N. coalition is eventually forced to retreat all the way back to Seoul when the Chinese intervene in the war on the North Korean side. Jin-tae gets his medal but Young-shin is captured by a South Korean militia, and the brothers attempt to stop them from executing her for treason when she is accused of having joined a communist party under the Northern occupation.

On Tuesday, MPs heard claims that forces were routinely manipulating crime statistics to meet targets. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was the first time a chief constable had spoken out in this way and his comments would fuel a debate about the reliability of crime data. Mr Creedon, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) on organised crime, insisted the \\"real position\\" was that domestic violence and sexual violence were going up. He said manipulation of the figures was the \\"unintended consequence\\" of pressure from police leaders, inspections and plans drawn up by police and crime commissioners to cut crime. Addressing the Acpo conference, he said: \\"Inadvertently we are putting pressure on officers to do all they can to manipulate to create crime reductions.\\" Peter Fahy, Greater Manchester Police's chief constable, said it was not about \\"fiddling\\" figures, but about the way forces chose to categorise various types of offence. \\"There's a huge field of interpretation,\\" he said.

Write an article based on this summary: The Bangladeshi government has failed to end extra-judicial killings carried out by a paramilitary force, Human Rights Watch says. Article:","completion":"Title: Human Rights Watch Raises Concern over Extra-Judicial Killings in Bangladesh Introduction: In recent years, numerous reports have emerged concerning widespread and systematic human rights abuses in Bangladesh, especially regarding extra-judicial killings. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), one of the leading international human rights organizations, the Bangladeshi government has repeatedly failed to address and end extra-judicial killings committed by a paramilitary force in the country. This article delves into the issue of extra-judicial killings in Bangladesh, examines the response of the Bangladeshi government, and highlights the implications of these failures on the country’s adherence to international human rights standards. Background: Extra-judicial killings refer to the deliberate killings of individuals by state actors without a fair trial or proper legal procedures. These extra-judicial actions often involve targeted assassinations, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary detentions. In Bangladesh, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite paramilitary force formed in 2004, has been the primary accused assailant in these extra-judicial killings. The Role of the Rapid Action Battalion: Since its formation, the RAB has acted as the primary counter-terrorism and law enforcement agency in Bangladesh. Many consider the force to be indispensable in the country’s fight against violent extremism and organized crime. However, the RAB has also been accused of perpetrating serious human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture. According to HRW, credible evidence exists linking the RAB to at least 1,000 extra-judicial killings since its inception. Concerns Raised by Human Rights Watch: In a report released by HRW, the organization states that despite repeated calls from national and international human rights bodies to address and end these extra-judicial killings, the Bangladeshi government has failed to demonstrate genuine commitment to resolving the issue. HRW further noted that apart from public assurances, there has been minimal effort to investigate any of the allegations thoroughly or impose any form of accountability on the perpetrators of these abuses. Moreover, the human rights organization claimed that rather than committing to reforms, the Bangladeshi government has sanctioned an environment of impunity that has allowed these grave violations of human rights to persist. There are growing concerns that the government's inaction further emboldens the RAB and other security forces to continue carrying out extra-judicial killings. Implications for Bangladesh: The failure of the Bangladeshi government to address and end extra-judicial killings not only undermines the principles of democracy and rule of law upon which the nation stands but also calls into question Bangladesh’s commitment to upholding fundamental human rights enshrined in several international conventions it has ratified. The continuation of extra-judicial killings in the country could lead to a further erosion of trust in government institutions, foster an environment where violent extremism and organized crime may thrive and perpetuate, and hinder the country’s progress in meeting its social, economic, and political goals. Furthermore, this inaction may strain Bangladesh's relationships with international allies who prioritize human rights protection and adherence to democratic principles. Conclusion: Human Rights Watch’s report on the Bangladeshi government’s failure to end extra-judicial killings conducted by its paramilitary force is a disturbing indication of the need for urgent reform. It is crucial for the Bangladeshi government to take concrete steps towards investigating these allegations thoroughly, holding the perpetrators of such abuses accountable, and ultimately, putting an end to extra-judicial killings. To uphold its commitment to human rights and democratic ideals, Bangladesh must prioritize addressing this pressing issue and work to reform its security forces in accordance with international human rights standards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\\" In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: It is one of those cultural markers that influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility. Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums. Whoever was responsible for choosing that particular photograph for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan really had an eye for a new look. Critic Janet Maslin summed up the iconic impact of the cover as \\"a photograph that inspired countless young men to hunch their shoulders, look distant, and let the girl do the clinging\\".The cover photo is recreated in the 2001 Tom Cruise film Vanilla Sky. contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who borrowed one of Dylan's big, bulky sweaters?, what is it ?

If \\"A man is standing alone in the dark.\\", does this mean that \\"A man is outside in the daylight.\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"A man is standing alone in the dark\\" is not the same as saying \\"A man is outside in the daylight.\\" These two statements describe different situations. In the first statement, the words \\"in the dark\\" depict a situation where there is an absence or lack of light, making it difficult to see. This immediately contrasts with the second statement that talks about daylight, which is a period when the sun is up, and light is present. In addition, the first statement does not specify whether the man is inside or outside, while the second statement clearly indicates that the man is outside. Analyzing the details within both statements: 1. \\"A man is standing alone in the dark.\\" - The man is standing, which means he is on his feet and not sitting or lying down. - He is alone, signifying that there is no one else around him. - The setting is dark, which means that visibility is low, and light is either minimal or non-existent. This could be because it is nighttime, he is in a room without lights, or any other circumstances where there is insufficient light. - Since the location is not specified, the man could be indoors or outdoors. 2. \\"A man is outside in the daylight.\\" - The man is outside, which means he is not in a building or a confined space. - The setting is daylight, implying that light is abundant, and the environment is visible. \\"Daylight\\" typically refers to the sunlight that reaches Earth's surface during the daytime. - The presence of other people is not mentioned in this statement, so the man could be alone or surrounded by others. - The man's posture is not specified in this statement; he could be standing, sitting, or in any other positions. To summarize, the two phrases describe different scenarios: one where a man is in a dark setting (illumination unspecified), and the other where the man is outdoors with abundant light during the daytime. The man's posture, company, and precise location are not consistent or detailed in both statements, and thus cannot be assumed or implied for direct comparison."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How will Alex's body respond to this?\\", is \\"be loved\\" a valid answer? Options are: --Yes; --No; The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"be loved\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How will Alex's body respond to this?\\" as it does not address the physiological response of Alex's body to being covered with an extra blanket. When Remy covers Alex with an extra blanket, Alex's body will most likely respond by increasing its temperature. In general, the human body responds to cold by doing a number of things, including constriction of blood vessels to maintain the core body temperature, and shivering which produces heat through involuntary muscle contractions. As Alex has been shivering, it is clear that their body has been trying to warm up by generating heat. When the extra blanket is placed over Alex, it acts as an insulation layer by trapping warm air, thus minimizing heat loss caused by convection. This helps maintain the warmth generated by the body so that the body can gradually increase its temperature. As Alex's body adjusts to the increased warmth, some of the physiological responses that occur due to cold temperatures, such as shivering or the constriction of blood vessels, may decrease or stop altogether. The ability to maintain a stable core temperature is important for the proper functioning of various internal organs and physiological processes. In conclusion, although the act of Remy covering Alex with an extra blanket is an expression of care and possibly love, the term \\"be loved\\" is not a valid response to describe the body's reaction to receiving warmth from the extra blanket. Instead, a more accurate answer would be that \\"Alex's body will respond by increasing its temperature and possibly ceasing to shiver as it becomes warmer due to the additional insulation provided by the blanket.\\""},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - The Emperor of Ethiopia (ngusä nägäst, \\"King of Kings\\") was the hereditary ruler of the Ethiopian Empire, until the abolition of the monarchy in 1975.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: hammer Pick from: (I) can destroy mattress easily (II) can destroy glass window easily","completion":"Option (II) can destroy glass window easily. Hammering a glass window would be far more effective and easier than destroying a mattress, due to the nature of the materials involved. The steps and precautions to follow when using a hammer to destroy a glass window are outlined below: 1. Prepare tools and equipment: First, gather the necessary tools, which would typically include a hammer, gloves, safety goggles, closed-toe shoes, and possibly a tarp or plastic sheet to collect broken glass. Wearing appropriate protective gear is crucial to ensure personal safety during the process. 2. Assess the window: Observe the window's size, type of glass, location, and surrounding materials, as this will help in planning the best approach and provide insights into any challenges or potential hazards. 3. Choose a starting point: To avoid collateral damage and minimize the risk of injury, it's important to begin the destruction at a specific point, ideally one of the corners or the middle of the window. This will also help control the dispersion of broken glass. 4. Cover the area: If possible, cover the area surrounding the window with a tarp or plastic sheet to make cleanup easier and to protect any valuables in the event of shattered glass flying across the room. 5. Use controlled force: Begin by gently tapping the chosen starting point with the hammer. Gradually increase the force to avoid unnecessary damage or injury due to excessive force. Break small sections of the window at a time, taking care to clear the broken glass in between stages. 6. Work methodically: Following a pattern or sequence when breaking the glass helps to maintain a controlled environment, reduces the risk of accidents, and ensures the task is completed efficiently. 7. Dispose of broken glass carefully: After breaking the glass, collect the shards, debris, or pieces using a dustpan or a broom. Place the broken glass into a box or container that can be securely sealed. Dispose of the container in accordance with local waste regulations. 8. Clean up: Once the glass has been removed and disposed of, thoroughly clean the area, especially if there are any remaining small shards that can cause injuries. Use a vacuum cleaner to pick up any residual glass particles. 9. Assess damages: After the glass window is destroyed, check the surrounding area for any collateral damage or necessary repairs. Ensure that the window frame and surrounding structure are still intact and do not pose any safety concerns. 10. Replace the window: Depending on the purpose behind the destruction, arranging for a replacement window or alternative security measures may be necessary. By following these steps and exercising caution, a hammer can be effectively utilized to destroy a glass window with relative ease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: The answer is:","completion":"Crystals have relatively sharp and well-defined melting points due to their highly ordered and regular arrangement of atoms or molecules in a periodic lattice structure. The crystal lattice structure creates strong and specific intermolecular forces and bonds between the constituent particles, which require a significant amount of energy to overcome. When this specific amount of energy is provided, usually in the form of heat, the strong bonds holding the crystal lattice together break, causing the solid to transition into a liquid. This transition occurs at a well-defined temperature, giving crystals a sharp melting point. The distinct melting points are often used to characterize and identify specific types of crystals or substances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Anger is good for you, as lon g as you control it, according to new psychology research. A new study from Carnegie Mellon University shows anger may help people reduce the negative impacts of stress and help you become healthier. \\"Here getting emotional is not bad for you if you look at the case of anger,\\" said Jennifer Lerner of Carnegie Mellon. \\"The more people display anger, the lower their stress responses.\\" Lerner studied 92 UCLA students by asking them to count back from 6,200. They must say out loud every thirteenth number. Researchers disturbed them by asking them to count faster or ask them other questions. If they made any mistakes, they had to restart from the very beginning. Many students felt depressed about making so many mistakes or got angry because the researchers were interrupting them. Lerner used a hidden video camera and recorded all their facial expressions during the test. The researchers describe their reactions as fear, anger and disgust. Other researchers recorded the students' blood pressure, pulse and production of a high-stress hormone called cortisol. People whose faces showed more fear during th e experiment had higher blood pressure and higher levels of the hormone. Both can have lasting effects such as diabetes , heart disease, depression and extra weight gain. When people feel fear, negative impacts increase, but when they get angry, those negatives go down, according to the study. \\"Having that sense of anger leads people to actually feel some power in what otherwise is maddening situation,\\" Lerner said. Lerner previously studied Americans' emotional response to the 911 terrorist attacks two months after the incident. She found people who reacted with anger were more optimistic. These people are healthier compared with those who were frightened during the event. So in maddening situations, anger is not a bad thing to have. It's a healthier response than fear.

(CNN) -- Sorry, Screech, but Zack thinks you are wrong. Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who played Zack Morris on the cult classic '90s TV show \\"Saved by the Bell,\\" doesn't agree with former co-star Dustin Diamond's portrayal of their time together. Diamond -- who played super nerdy Samuel \\"Screech\\" Powers -- put out a book years ago titled \\"Behind the Bell.\\" Now there's a Lifetime TV movie, \\"The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story,\\" which purports to show the less-than-glamorous side of life on the show, complete with fights, jealousy and other drama. During an interview with HuffPostLive to promote his current series, \\"Franklin & Bash,\\" Gosselaar said he neither was involved with nor consulted on the TV project. (Gosselaar) and I have talked endlessly about '","completion":"Saved by the Bell' since we both left the show, but I can tell you I don't remember any instances like those mentioned in the book or the movie,\\" Gosselaar said. \\"From what I knew of Diamond, he was always seeking attention and trying to be the center of things. His account of events is not how I remember them.\\" As the Lifetime movie's air date approaches, the rest of the \\"Saved by the Bell\\" cast members distance themselves from the project, sharing their own recollections and experiences. To their surprise, many of their accounts align with Gosselaar's, debunking much of the controversy stirred by Diamond's book. In an attempt to set the record straight, Gosselaar organizes a live interview with all the main cast members to address the inaccuracies of the book and Lifetime movie. During the discussion, everyone speaks frankly about their time on the show and tells some lighthearted stories they hadn't shared before. They explain how their relationships as cast members were not perfect, but the negative picture painted by Diamond was largely exaggerated. Meanwhile, Diamond, who becomes aware of the reunion interview, starts to feel remorse for his actions. He realizes that his desire for attention and fame ultimately drove a wedge between him and his former co-stars. With the supportive encouragement of a close friend, Diamond reaches out to Gosselaar and the rest of the cast to apologize for the damage caused by his book. Touched by his sincerity, Gosselaar invites Diamond to join the live interview as a surprise. Diamond hesitantly accepts the invitation and confronts his former castmates on air. He offers a heartfelt apology and admits that his account of events had been distorted for his own benefit. The cast members, though cautious at first, forgive Diamond and share a genuine moment of reconciliation. The interview receives widespread positive coverage, with fans expressing their relief and happiness that the \\"Saved by the Bell\\" cast is able to smile and reminisce together again. With lingering tensions resolved, the actors make an effort to rebuild their friendships and occasionally get together to reflect on their shared past. In the end, everyone involved realizes the importance of honesty, forgiveness, and the power of friendship. The once tarnished image of their time on the beloved '90s series is restored, and the \\"Saved by the Bell\\" legacy lives on in the hearts of fans and the cast alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It’s not easy to get to Michele Bachmann. Her appearance at a rally on Tuesday in Aiken, S.C., attended by perhaps 150 people, featured three uniformed police officers and two plainclothes bodyguards. One of those guards spent much of the day preventing reporters from getting too close to the candidate. After her speech, as she greeted fans and signed autographs, he planted himself directly in front of another man filming her chitchat with a handheld video camera. (At another event on Tuesday, I saw the same man making hand gestures to another Bachmann staffer when I came near with a pen and pad.) (MORE: Nine Epically Wrong Politician History Flubs) But for Bachmann there was no escaping the media’s intense interest in a report that she suffers from crippling migraines, as indicated by the ominous presence of ABC investigative reporter Brian Ross at her rally. (It’s a handy rule of thumb that when Brian Ross is around, you have a problem.) So shortly after her remarks, Bachmann stepped away from the stage and read a statement that her press aide Alice Stewart appeared to have been fine-tuning just moments before. Here’s an excerpt: Since entering this campaign for the presidency, I have maintained a full schedule between my duties as Congresswoman and as a presidential candidate traveling across the nation to meet with voters … I have prescribed medication that I take on occasion whenever symptoms arise and they keep my migraines under control. But I’d like to be abundantly clear: My ability to function effectively will not affect my ability to serve as commander in chief. [Update: Bachmann’s campaign later released her complete statement. She appears to have misread the last line above, which I transcribed verbatim.] Bachmann said 30 million Americans suffer from migraines and that “nearly 1 in 4 American households” have a migraine sufferer. “While I appreciate the concern for myself and for my health,” she added, looking to climb back down to safer ground, “the greater concern should be the debate that is occurring today in Washington, D.C., over whether or not we will increase our debt spending and taxes.” Bachmann reiterated that she would not vote to raise the debt ceiling. And with that, she departed without taking questions. (PHOTOS: Portraits of the Tea Party) That’s when things got interesting. Ross dashed after Bachmann, repeatedly asking whether she had ever missed a House vote due to a migraine. She ignored him. Ross pursued her into a parking area behind the stage. Her aides grew alarmed. When Ross made a beeline for the white SUV waiting to carry Bachmann away, two Bachmann men pounced on him, grabbing and pushing him multiple times with what looked to me like unusual force. In fact, I have never seen a reporter treated so roughly at a campaign event, especially not a presidential one. Ross was finally able to break away and lob his question at Bachmann one more time, but she continued to ignore him. Afterward, I asked Ross — a hard-nosed pro who nevertheless seemed slightly shaken — whether he had ever been treated so roughly. “A few times,” he told me. “Mostly by Mafia people.” To zoom out for a minute, what’s most interesting here isn’t Bachmann’s headaches. She’s still a long way from the nuclear football, and unless the story takes some darker turn, I don’t see why a seemingly manageable battle with migraines would be a game changer for her candidacy. (MORE: The Truth Behind Marcus Bachmann’s Controversial Christian Therapy Clinic) The more pertinent question may have to do with Bachmann’s preparedness for the campaign circus. Running for President, at least in its early retail stage, requires a willingness to answer inconvenient questions in settings more chaotic and unpredictable than the cable-television interviews to which she is accustomed. The trail is a messy place where reporters will swarm you. It’s definitely not always fun — and can be enough to give even a seasoned candidate a migraine. The question raised this afternoon is whether Bachmann is ready for it. ||||| In late July 2010, Rep. Michele Bachmann’s then-communications director, Dave Dziok, told his boss that he planned to take a new job with the public relations firm Edelman. Dziok had worked for Bachmann for two and a half years, a relatively long period by the standards of her office, and was leaving on good terms. Staff turnover can frustrate any employer, but Bachmann responded more dramatically. Dziok’s departure triggered a debilitating medical episode that landed the congresswoman in urgent care. “Within 24 hours she was in the hospital,” a former aide says. Bachmann was admitted to a Washington, D.C. hospital on Friday, July 30, and released that same day. She flew home to Minnesota to recuperate, missing a scheduled campaign event with Sen. Roy Blunt. It’s “nothing folks should worry about going forward,” Dziok told reporters at the time, refusing to specify why Bachmann had been hospitalized. It was, according to three people who have worked closely with Bachmann, not an isolated event. (Bachmann signs ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance’ pledge, adds promise to defund Obamacare) The Minnesota Republican frequently suffers from stress-induced medical episodes that she has characterized as severe headaches. These episodes, say witnesses, occur once a week on average and can “incapacitate” her for days at time. On at least three occasions, Bachmann has landed in the hospital as a result. “She has terrible migraine headaches. And they put her out of commission for a day or more at a time. They come out of nowhere, and they’re unpredictable,” says an adviser to Bachmann who was involved in her 2010 congressional campaign. “They level her. They put her down. It’s actually sad. It’s very painful.” Bachmann’s medical condition wouldn’t merit public attention, but for the fact she is running for president. Some close to Bachmann fear she won’t be equal to the stress of the campaign, much less the presidency itself. “When she gets ’em, frankly, she can’t function at all. It’s not like a little thing with a couple Advils. It’s bad,” the adviser says. “The migraines are so bad and so intense, she carries and takes all sorts of pills. Prevention pills. Pills during the migraine. Pills after the migraine, to keep them under control. She has to take these pills wherever she goes.” To staff, Bachmann has implausibly blamed the headaches on uncomfortable high-heel shoes, but those who have worked closely with her cite stress, a busy schedule and anything going badly for Bachmann as causes. Alice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Bachmann, said “she suffers from migraines and they’re under control with medicine.” Stewart contested descriptions of the episodes as “incapacitating” Bachmann but did not specify how the descriptions were wrong. “The information you have is incorrect,” Stewart said. She declined to discuss Bachmann’s hospital visits at all, saying, “I’m not going to go into her medical history.” On the evening of May 13, 2010, Bachmann flew to Los Angeles for a series of political and fundraising events. In part because of complications with her flight schedule, Bachmann’s mood plunged. During the entire six-hour flight, she was desperately sick from headaches. (Perry, Bachmann lead in July Daily Caller/Conservative Home tracking poll) Her husband, Marcus Bachmann, met his wife at LAX and ushered her to a nearby urgent care center. Though Bachmann managed to attend several events in California, including an appearance before a California chapter of the Eagle Forum and a fundraiser in Palm Springs, she struggled through the weekend, in pain throughout. On October 19, 2010, Bachmann fell apart at a Greenwich, Conn., fundraiser at the home of Craig Stevenson, CEO of Diamond S Shipping. She was put in a bed at Stevenson’s home and later checked into an urgent care facility near LaGuardia Airport. Back in February 2006, Bachmann checked into the hospital for what a press release called “an appendicitis attack,” according to an archive of her website. “Michele felt very well immediately after the surgery but then suffered from complications, including nausea and intense migraines,” the press release reads. Of particular concern to some around her is the significant amount of medication Bachmann takes to address her condition. The former aide says Bachmann’s congressional staff is “constantly” in contact with her doctors to tweak the types and amounts of medicine she is taking. Marcus Bachmann helps her manage the episodes. Sources who spoke to The Daily Caller said they did so because they are terrified about the impact the condition could have on Bachmann’s performance if she actually became president. They also worry that the issue could blow up in the general election campaign, giving President Obama an easy path to re-election. “It’s a careful choice of words I used: ‘incapacitated,’” the adviser says. “As president, when she’s in crisis management mode, is she going to have the physical ability to withstand the most difficult challenges facing America?” the former aide asks. TheDC agreed to provide the sources anonymity because they were providing information only a select group of people could know, at great professional risk. Two sources independently provided detailed accounts of Bachmann’s condition. A third source confirmed that Bachmann frequently suffers from debilitating headache episodes.

In response, Bachmann spokesman Alice Stewart said Ross was overly aggressive and that he “jumped on stage and rushed towards us.” “We didn’t have time for any questions, and we made it clear we had to leave, and he disregarded repeated requests to stay back,” Stewart said.

Title: The Ides of March Movie plot: Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the junior campaign manager for Mike Morris, Governor of Pennsylvania and a Democratic presidential candidate, competing against Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman in the Democratic primary. Both campaigns are attempting to secure the endorsement of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), who controls 356 convention delegates, enough to clinch the nomination for either candidate. After a debate at Miami University, Meyers is asked by Pullman's campaign manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), to meet in secret. Meyers calls his boss, senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who doesn't answer. Meyers decides to meet Duffy, who offers Meyers a position in Pullman's campaign, an offer Meyers refuses. Zara calls Meyers back and asks what was important, but Meyers says it was nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, Meyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), an attractive intern for Morris's campaign and daughter of Jack Stearns, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, and that Duffy said his candidate will offer Thompson the position of Secretary of State, guaranteeing Pullman's victory. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson to secure his endorsement and his delegates' votes.

John McCain and Barack Obama battle over who has the best approach to national security, a new CNN poll finds Americans' concerns about terrorism have hit an all-time low for the post-September 11 era. A poll finds fewer Americans fear an imminent terror attack than at any time since September 11, 2001. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday, 35 percent of Americans believe a terrorist attack somewhere in the United States is likely over the next several weeks. The figure is the lowest in a CNN poll since the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Between 2002 and 2006, summertime polls typically showed that a majority of Americans believed that a terrorist attack was likely. Last summer, that figure dropped to 41 percent. This summer, it dropped another 6 percentage points. The latest CNN poll also indicates that the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. Three in 10 voters favor the war, while 68 percent oppose it. Similarly, a third of voters would like to see the next president keep the same number of troops in Iraq that are stationed there now. See how the poll numbers stack up ». For McCain, who is seeking to highlight his national security credentials and has staunchly defended the U.S. presence in Iraq, the latest poll results may not be viewed in a positive light. \\"Sen. McCain's greatest strength is in foreign policy, particularly his reputation as the candidate best able to fight the war on terror,\\" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. \\"As the threat of a terrorist attack continues to recede in the mind of the American voter, the state of the economy and other domestic issues are likely to become even more important. That would be good news for Sen. Obama, since the Democrats currently beat or tie the Republicans on every issue except terrorism.\\" Another potential problem for McCain may be found in President Bush's latest job approval ratings. According to the survey, 30 percent of Americans approve of how Bush is handling his job, while 68 percent disapprove of Bush's job performance. These numbers are roughly consistent with the president's approval ratings over most of the last two years. They also reinforce the need for the presumptive Republican nominee to create an impression of distance and distinction between himself and Bush. Democrats, on the other hand, are eager to tie McCain to the unpopular outgoing president and portray his possible election as the equivalent of a third Bush term. The poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday by phone, surveyed 1,026 adult Americans and carries a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article talks about a new CNN poll that shows people in America are not as worried about terrorism as they used to be after the September 11 attacks. It also says that most Americans do not like the war in Iraq and that many people do not agree with the way President Bush is doing his job. This could be important for the two men, John McCain and Barack Obama, who are trying to become the next president because people might be more focused on other things like the economy instead of national security."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
