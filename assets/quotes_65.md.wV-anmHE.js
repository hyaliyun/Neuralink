Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: A nice detail from the JPost’s write-up of today’s grand sellout. Turns out “snap inspections” are actually “nearly-a-month’s-notice inspections.” Negotiators failed to meet the standard of achieving “anytime, anywhere” access that several members of the United States Congress had demanded as a part of any nuclear deal. Instead, in the event Iran objects to an IAEA request for access to a specific site, a “clock” will begin that grants the two sides 14 days to negotiate. If that period expires without any resolution reached directly between Iran and the IAEA, the Joint Commission would have seven days to advise them on a way forward. Iran would then have three days to comply with the commission’s final advice, bringing the total time on the clock to 24 days… “We don’t think that ‘anytime, anywhere’ inspections are feasible,” the official said. “It’s just not something that happens anywhere in the world.” All you need to do to make sense of this deal is believe, as the White House obviously does, that attacking Iran’s enrichment facilities would be a worse outcome than Iran building a bomb. That’s it. The great shining “achievement” of the deal isn’t that it eliminates Iran’s program — it doesn’t — but that it removes any remaining domestic pressure on Obama to further escalate with Iran, either by sanctions or military strike, to stop it. The eternal argument against attacking Iran’s program is that virtually no one believes the attack would completely destroy all of the country’s nuclear infrastructure, just damage enough of it to set Tehran back 10 years or so. But … that’s exactly what today’s deal does. It’s not a permanent fix. By its own terms and Obama’s admission, after 12 years of compliance, Iran will be able to introduce advanced centrifuges and reduce its “breakout” time to nearly nothing, making it a full “nuclear threshold” state. In an interview with NPR in April, Mr. Obama said that in “year 13, 14, 15” of the agreement, the breakout time might shrink “almost down to zero,” as Iran is expected to develop and use advanced centrifuges then… The official asserted that the reduction in the breakout time would be gradual because Iran’s stockpile of less enriched uranium would be limited for 15 years. But after that period, Iran could have a substantial enrichment capability. “It is going to be a gradual decline,” the official said. “At the end of, say, 15 years, we are not going to know what that is.” An attack would achieve little except to buy the west time. Today’s deal … achieves little except to buy the west time, except Iran also gets many billions of dollars in economic stimulus via sanctions relief plus an influx of arms and ballistic missile technology when the UN embargoes on those are lifted within the next eight years plus, most importantly, the blessing of the international community once Iran begins enriching again at the end of the deal. What will the argument against Iran’s program be circa 2030 when they decide to install state-of-the-art centrifuges capable of producing enough enriched uranium for a bomb in days or even hours? We’re signing a deal today that allows them to do that. With this, the west formally endorses Iran as a nuclear state — just not in the near term, when President Precious rather than one of his successors would have to deal with the consequences. So Obama’s a big winner today. Now he doesn’t have to think about this for the next 18 months, unless Iran is so stupid as to risk getting caught cheating before he leaves office in 2017. Iran, obviously, is the biggest winner. Kerry’s a winner in that he’ll now surely get a Nobel and a “legacy,” if not quite the one he’s expecting. The big losers are the Sunnis of the Middle East, who’ll need to scramble to counter an Iran that’s suddenly flush with cash and will have easier access to weapons by the end of the decade, and the American public, which will have an even worse headache from Iran’s nuclear program to deal with before the 2028 election than it has now. Via the Free Beacon, here’s CNN anchor Jim Sciutto marveling that if you’d told the White House these would be the terms of the final deal a few years ago, they … wouldn’t have been too happy. Go figure. Two questions to ponder now. One: What’s the argument against giving, say, Saudi Arabia this exact same nuclear timeline — 10 years of no, or low, enrichment followed by the right to enrich their brains out with the international community’s blessing? The grand irony of this capitulation is that Obama, a guy who campaigned against nuclear proliferation, is effectively removing the taboo against new nuclear states. If you want to build a bomb, that’s fine, but you need to do it gradually, on the west’s schedule. Two: Obama and Kerry have no choice now but to aggressively pursue a grand bargain with Iran, right? The only way to neutralize an Iranian bomb after this is to make them so friendly to the west that they wouldn’t think of using it. And the clock is ticking on that given the near certainty that (a) a Republican will return to the White House sometime before 2028, when the deal will be winding down, and (b) that Republican will be far less inclined towards detente with Iran than Obama is. If Obama wants to bind the hands of his successors (or at least make it much harder for them to start a new cold war with Tehran), he needs to strike that grand bargain himself. Can’t wait to see the magic beans we get as part of that deal. ||||| President Obama announces Iran deal from the White House Tuesday morning. President Obama announces Iran deal from the White House Tuesday morning. Twenty months after formal negotiations began, Iran and six world powers have produced an agreement designed to curtail Iran's nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for lifting international economic and oil sanctions. The agreement requires Iran to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent, mothball two-thirds of the centrifuges it uses to carry out enrichment, turn a once-secret centrifuge facility into a research center, redesign the Arak reactor that could produce plutonium for a bomb and open itself to the most intrusive nuclear inspection regime ever imposed on any nation. Here is the entire text of the agreement. Here is a link to the president's address. In an early morning address at the White House that was broadcast live in Iran, President Obama said compliance with the agreement is \\"not built on trust, it is built on verification.\\" He now faces what is certain to be a contentious debate in Congress over the deal a large percentage of Republicans—particularly the bomb-bomb-bomb crowd—as well as some Democrats will likely oppose: But Mr. Obama made it abundantly clear that he would fight to preserve the deal in its entirety, saying, “I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal.” Not everyone was celebrating the accord. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called it a “historic mistake” that would ultimately create a “terrorist nuclear superpower.” The agreement's foes will have a difficult path. They need a two-thirds majority to overcome any presidential vetoes and putting together that many votes in the matter seems out of reach. Without an agreement, the Obama administration says, Iran currently has the technological skills, facilities and fissionable material to build a nuclear bomb within two to three months. Taken altogether the agreement extends this so-called \\"break-out\\" capacity to more than a year. In the latter years of the agreement, and something that foes of the deal will surely raise during debate, the break-out time will gradually dwindle as Iran is allowed to install more sophisticated centrifuges that can enrich uranium 20 times faster than the models it now uses. But by then the world could be a very different place. Assuming nothing intervenes to block the agreement, which seems highly unlikely, it is a major diplomatic victory for President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and the negotiators of France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia. The agreement could also bring about an era of improved relations between the U.S. and Iran after 36 years of ferocious antagonism and a 12-year stand-off over Iran's nuclear program. That stand-off was punctuated by repeated right-wing calls for air attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities. Any attacks, in addition to killing large numbers of Iranian civilians, would certainly have produced a strong military response from Iran, something the proponents chose to ignore the way they always ignore blowback and the other consequences of such actions. ||||| Josh Rogin is a Bloomberg View columnist who writes about national security and foreign affairs. He has previously worked for the Daily Beast, Newsweek, Foreign Policy magazine, the Washington Post, Congressional Quarterly and Asahi Shimbun. He is a graduate of the George Washington University. The newly announced deal between Iran and six world powers is \\"akin to declaring war on Israel and the Sunni Arabs,\\" and will be a huge problem for Hillary Clinton, according to GOP presidential candidate and Senator Lindsey Graham, who promised to not uphold the deal if he is elected next year. \\"My initial impression is that this deal is far worse than I ever dreamed it could be and will be a nightmare for the region, our national security and eventually the world at large,\\" Graham told me in an interview early Tuesday morning, just after Iran, China, France, Russia, Britain, the U.S. and Germany confirmed they had reached terms for a historic deal to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Graham reacted harshly to many of the details about the deal that were emerging early Tuesday, including the news that the conventional arms embargo on Iran will be largely lifted and replaced by a limitation of Iranian arms imports and exports for five years. Reports also stated early Tuesday that limitations on Iran's ballistic missile program will begin to ease after eight years. \\"If the initial reports regarding the details of this deal hold true, there's no way as president of the United States I would honor this deal,\\" Graham said. \\"It's incredibly dangerous for our national security, and it's akin to declaring war on Sunni Arabs and Israel by the P5+1 because it ensures their primary antagonist Iran will become a nuclear power and allows them to rearm conventionally.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Tuesday that the deal was \\"a historic mistake.\\" Hillary Clinton has not yet reacted publicly; in the past she has expressed cautious optimism about the deal and said she was waiting to see the details. \\"Hillary Clinton's reaction to this deal is the first real test of her ability to be president and her judgment,\\" said Graham. \\"If she believes it's a good idea to lift the arms embargo without first seeing a behavior change by the Iranians, then her judgment as commander in chief will be very much in question.\\" He said President Obama put Democrats in an impossible situation: \\"He's pitted Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party against common sense and the security of the American people.\\" Congress will have 60 days to review the deal, after it is submitted to them by the administration. After that, Congress will have the option of debating and passing a resolution of approval or a resolution of disapproval, or doing nothing and letting the deal stand. If Congress passes a resolution of disapproval, the president is likely to veto it, and then Congress will struggle to muster an override vote. Many Democrats have kept their powder dry, awaiting the details of the final deal. They will likely be looking toward Clinton for guidance, as she is the favorite to be the party's presidential nominee. The negotiations in Iran began while Clinton was secretary of state. \\"She bears some responsibility for starting the process. The only question is, will she ratify the results,\\" said Graham. In addition to the lifting of the embargo, Graham said lawmakers in both parties will be put off by the fact that the restrictions on Iranian enrichment expire over time. \\"There is no chance that this deal will be approved by Congress,\\" he said, predicting rejection by \\"an overwhelming super majority in both the House and the Senate.\\" Graham also predicted that the deal would lead to an arms race in the Middle East and expanded hostilities between Shiite and Sunni Arabs all over the region. \\"If I had property in the Middle East, I would think about selling it after this deal.\\" This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Nixon made a huge Cold War gamble that he could forge a working relationship with a Communist country that had built a small arsenal of nuclear weapons and clearly had long-term ambitions for global power. For President Obama, the deal struck Tuesday morning with Iran represents a similar leap of faith, a bet that by defusing the country’s nuclear threat — even if just for a decade or so — he and his successors would have the time and space to restructure one of the United States’ deepest adversarial relationships. Mr. Obama will be long out of office before any reasonable assessment can be made as to whether that roll of the dice paid off. The best guess today, even among the most passionate supporters of the president’s Iran project, is that the judgment will be mixed. Little in the deal announced on Tuesday eliminates Iran’s ability to become a threshold nuclear power eventually — it just delays the day. To Mr. Obama’s many critics, including Henry A. Kissinger, the architect of the China opening, that is a fatal flaw. It does nothing, Mr. Kissinger wrote recently with another former secretary of state, George P. Shultz, to change “three and a half decades of militant hostility to the West.” ||||| The announcement of a historic deal with Iran curbing that country’s nuclear program makes it more likely that the 2016 election will be fought, at least partly, around a broad argument over the proper extent of U.S. international engagement as a means to solve the biggest future challenges we face. It also means the presidential contenders will take sides around what has been called the Obama Doctrine: The idea that we should accept the limits of American power to enable us to solve these challenges on our own, even if that entails engaging internationally in ways that carry risks in their own right. The details of the deal are listed right here. Congressional Republicans have already condemned it, while some key Senate Democrats — such as Tim Kaine of Virginia — are saying generally positive things while reserving judgment on the details. But the consensus this morning is that it will be very hard for Congress to block the deal from moving forward, at least in the short term. Because of the way Congress has structured its oversight mechanism, even if Congress disapproves of it, President Obama only needs just over one-third of one chamber to stick with his veto of that disapproval, which is very likely to happen. Some of the major GOP presidential candidates — such as Scott Walker and Marco Rubio — have already pledged to undo an agreement with Iran, and crucially, they have said they will do so regardless of whether our allies want that deal to continue. Jeb Bush also condemned the previous framework. By contrast, Hillary Clinton is likely to support the deal, though it remains to be seen how much hedging she’ll do along the way. Michael Crowley has a useful look at Clinton’s public statements on Iran, noting that she’s generally more hawkish than Obama but that she’s ultimately supportive of his diplomacy. Thus, the argument that develops around the agreement may also take shape around the virtues and risks of international engagement. And this could join other issues to feed into a broader contrast, in which Republicans are opposing international engagement on multiple fronts — including Cuba and climate change (on which we may have an accord later this year). Meanwhile, Clinton may well embrace international engagement on multiple fronts, and use this contrast to cast the GOP as too inward looking and trapped in the past to confront the challenges of the future. Peter Beinart argues provocatively that GOP opposition to the Iran deal is premised on a refusal to acknowledge the limits of American power. This puts Republicans in the position of opposing the deal mainly because there are risks associated with it, without offering any credible alternative. Obama described his international approach in similar terms in a recent interview with Thomas Friedman, who characterized the president’s position this way: America’s power may not be limitless, but it remains overwhelming, and the U.S. thus “needs to have the self-confidence to take some calculated risks to open important new possibilities.” This doctrine also applies to engagement with Cuba and to an international climate accord (we don’t know whether other countries will keep up their end of the bargain). Beinart also suggests that the American mainstream may be more sympathetic to this worldview than pundits (who tend to give the Republican position the benefit of the doubt in such situations) think. I agree. While it’s hard to predict how the specifics of the Iran deal will play politically, Democrats should not fear this broader contrast. They should lean into it. ******************************************************************* * THE IRAN DEAL, SUMMARIZED: The Wall Street Journal has a quick summary: At the heart of the agreement between Iran and the six powers — the U.S., U.K., Russia, China, Germany and France — is Tehran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear activities for 10 years. These are supposed to ensure that the country remains a minimum of 12 months away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb. After the 10-year period, those constraints will ease in the subsequent five years. In exchange, the U.S., the European Union and the United Nations will lift tight international sanctions on Tehran, a move that Western diplomats say could help Iran’s economy to expand by 7% to 8% annually for years to come. Daniel Larison makes the case for the deal on these grounds: “This will limit Iran’s nuclear program more effectively than a decade of sanctions and coercive methods ever did, and it makes Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon much less likely than any other available course of action.” * OBAMA VOWS VETO IN IRAN FIGHT: The President’s statement this morning: “This deal is not built on trust. It is built on verification. Inspectors will have 24/7 access to Iran’s nuclear facilities…I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interests of the United States and our allies. So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict.” Republicans will argue that the deal is folly precisely because it requires us to “trust” Iran. * OBAMA HOPES CONGRESS WILL BACK IRAN DEAL: The New York Times reports that Obama will likely get his way even if Congress disapproves of the deal, but he wants approval: Mr. Obama’s chances of ultimately prevailing are considered high. Even if the accord is voted down by one or both houses, he could veto that action, and he is likely to have the votes he would need to prevail in an effort to override the veto. But he has told aides that for an accord as important as this one — which he hopes will usher in a virtual truce with a country that has been a major American adversary for 35 years — he wants a congressional endorsement. But that would require Republicans — who have acted as if this deal is being negotiated by Obama and no one else — to endorse what they have already designated as Obama’s Capitulation To Iran. * IRAN COULD BECOME ISSUE IN SENATE RACES: National Journal reports that Democrats think they can put Republican Senators on the defensive over their expected opposition to the deal. DSCC spokesman Justin Barasky notes that the public disapproved of Tom Cotton’s letter to Iran and will see opposition to the accord as obstructionist, adding: “I think they’re the ones that are going to have to deal with the voters in a way that’s problematic.” Of course, a number of Senate Dems could oppose the deal. Notably, Congress now has 60 days to review it, which means that Senators and Members will catch an earful from voters back at home during the August recess. * CAN PELOSI SAVE IRAN DEAL? Bloomberg reports that the White House is relying on Nancy Pelosi as the firewall against Congressional disapproval of the deal. If the Senate musters 67 votes to override Obama’s veto of a Congressional vote against it, the deal still moves forward for now if more than one-third of Members of the House side with Obama. Reminder: 150 House Dems have already signed a letter backing an Iran deal in general, which means House Dems likely would sustain a veto, though that’s not assured. * LEFT GEARS UP TO DEFEND AGREEMENT: The statement on the accord just out from MoveOn: “MoveOn members are going to fight like hell to defend it and to stop opponents from dragging the U.S. into yet another costly, deadly war of choice….We call on every member of Congress to support this agreement. Persuading senators and representatives to do so will be MoveOn members’ top priority over the next 60 days.” If Congressional Democrats somehow end up helping Republicans tank the deal, you’d think there would be absolute hell to pay from the base…. * AND THERE’S BROAD SUPPORT FOR DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN: Aaron Blake reviews the recent polling and finds surprisingly broad support for diplomacy, even across party lines. This will not stop commentators from reflexively concluding that the politics of this will inveitably favor Republicans, of course. ||||| The United States and five other world powers have reached a deal with Iran that would place strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear program in return for ending sanctions on its economy, the culmination of years of delicate diplomacy pursued by President Barack Obama despite warnings the agreement could strengthen Iran’s Islamist regime and leave it dangerously close to a nuclear bomb. The historic accord, reached by Secretary of State John Kerry and his international counterparts in Vienna on Tuesday after 18 days of intense negotiations, now faces review from a hostile Republican-led Congress, opposition from every GOP presidential candidate, from Israel’s government and from Sunni Arab monarchs. The deal’s long and complex implementation process also leaves it vulnerable to unraveling. Story Continued Below Speaking from the White House Tuesday morning, Obama called the deal a victory for diplomacy that would prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and avert a possible conflict with Iran. “No deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East,” Obama said. He reaffirmed America’s commitment to Israel’s security and Gulf Arab states like Saudi Arabia, while adding that the U.S. is “open to engagement on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect.” Obama also hinted at the possibility of a larger thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations. ”It is possible to change,” Obama told Iranians, urging them to take a “different path, one of tolerance, of peaceful resolution to conflict… This deal opens an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it.” “This is the good deal that we have sought,” Kerry said in a statement from Vienna. If it succeeds, the agreement could upgrade Obama’s checkered foreign policy legacy, as well provide a crowning achievement for Kerry’s 30-year political career. Analysts call it one of the modern era’s most important arms control agreements, in a league with the 1970 international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the 1994 START nuclear missile treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Some believe it could begin to normalize relations between Iran and the West after three decades of cold war, although Obama and Kerry have denied that is their goal, while others predict that an emboldened Iran will seek greater dominance across the Middle East. But on Tuesday the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Frederica Mogherini, called the pact “much more than a nuclear deal,” adding: “It can open a new chapter.” On Twitter, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani said that with the “unnecessary crisis resolved, new horizons emerge with a focus on shared challenges.” That will hardly please Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who tweeted: “From the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is a historic mistake.” According to a 159-page document posted online by Russia’s foreign ministry, which it called the final text of the deal, a U.N. resolution lifting sanctions will also express the Security Council’s “desire to build a new relationship with Iran.” The text says also that Iran has vowed that “under no circumstances” will it ever “seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.” And it describes a joint commission composed of its seven parties to monitor the deal’s implementation. One issue that will draw close scrutiny from nuclear experts is Iran’s ability to research advanced nuclear technologies while its program is constrained by a deal. Iran now relies on 1970s-era centrifuges to enrich uranium, which are highly inefficient. The document posted by Russian foreign ministry says that after 8½ years Iran can begin testing up to 30 modern IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges. Analysts fear that, if Iran masters top-quality centrifuges, it might be capable of producing a bomb in a matter of months or weeks soon after the deal’s main restrictions lift in a decade. On an issue that snagged the talks in their final days, the deal will free Iran from an arms embargo after five years, Obama said Tuesday. Obama has made the deal a central plank of his foreign policy. Dating from early in the 2008 presidential campaign, he called for fresh thinking toward American adversaries like Iran. As president, he has argued that it is wiser to negotiate with a nemesis of more than three decades than risk a military confrontation over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But he has also insisted, in response to the many critics who called him desperate for a deal, that signing off on a weak agreement is not in his interest. “If Iran has a nuclear weapon, it’s my name on this,” the president said in May — a measure of just how keenly aware he is of the deal’s implications for his legacy. The deal came 18 days after Kerry arrived in Vienna for a round of talks whose initial deadline was June 30. As early July came and went, the talks bogged down in a handful of issues, including whether and how to lift a U.N. embargo on Iran’s import and export of conventional arms. Kerry, too, was accused of wanting a deal too badly, a charge his marathon session in Vienna — all of it on crutches, as he recovers from a broken leg — may have defused. The comprehensive deal fills in the details of a preliminary framework deal reached in April by the U.S. and its negotiating partners — France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia. A document said to be about 100 pages will be transmitted to Congress and made public, although some portions are expected to remain classified. Obama’s main goal has been to impose limits on Iran’s fast-advancing nuclear program to ensure that Tehran can’t acquire a nuclear bomb faster than the U.S. and its allies can act to stop it. The deal seeks to do that by reducing Iran’s capacity to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium, slowing its research and development into nuclear technology, and imposing inspections and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear activities to prevent cheating. The goal is to achieve a “breakout time” — or the time it would take Iran to produce the nuclear material required for one bomb — of at least one year. That is long enough, U.S. officials believe, for the world community to take punitive action that could include airstrikes against Iranian facilities. Some elements of the deal were locked in by an April 2 political framework agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. They include a commitment by Iran to reduce its number of installed centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, with only 5,060 of those enriching uranium for 10 years. Centrifuges spin gaseous uranium at supersonic speeds to increase its purity to levels suitable for a nuclear weapon. Iran has also agreed to modify a plutonium-fueled nuclear reactor so that its fuel cannot be reprocessed for use in a weapon. And it will allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency broad access to suspected nuclear sites, as well as cooperate with an IAEA investigation into its past activities, although many crucial details have yet to be released. The comprehensive agreement will leave many powerful critics deeply dissatisfied. Netanyahu, who sees Iran as an existential threat to his country, has said repeatedly that the deal will “pave Iran’s path to the bomb”; several Sunni Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, worry that the end of sanctions will free up tens of billions of dollars that Iran can direct to militant allies like Hezbollah and sectarian battles from Iraq to Syria to Yemen. The emerging outlines of the deal have also drawn withering fire for months from Capitol Hill, fueled by Republicans — and many Democrats — who agree with Netanyahu that it jeopardizes Israel’s security. A vote of disapproval by Congress would prevent Obama from lifting sanctions on Tehran, although administration officials believe they can maintain enough Democratic backing to sustain a presidential veto. The nuclear talks began after years of Western worry over Iran’s nuclear aims, despite Tehran’s insistence that its program was only for scientific and energy purposes. The 2002 revelation of Iran’s uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a plutonium reactor at Arak — sites previously undeclared to the U.N. in violation of Iran’s international commitments — badly undercut Tehran’s claims. So did the 2009 discovery of a secret, underground enrichment facility buried in a mountain at Fordow, near the holy city of Qom. In 2007, an assessment by the U.S. intelligence community found that Iran had pursued a military dimension to its nuclear program — in effect, an Iranian Manhattan Project — but ceased the work in 2003. Iran has failed to comply fully with IAEA inspectors pursuing the question, a major point of contention in the talks. The United States, which broke off diplomatic relations with Iran after the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution and capture of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has long used sanctions and other tools to punish Iran for its behavior. In recent years the sanctions vice tightened considerably as Russia and China backed harsh U.N. measures, the U.S. Congress targeted Iran’s financial sector, and the Obama administration persuaded growing economies like India and South Korea agreed to sharply limit their consumption of Iranian oil. At the same time, after taking office Obama continued a Bush-era program targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure with cyberwar, in the form of the Stuxnet virus, which delayed Iran’s enrichment program. The U.S., U.N. and EU sanctions badly hurt Iran’s economy; inflation soared above 40 percent in 2013. U.S. sanctions threatening to punish foreign financial institutions for doing business with Iran landed a particularly painful blow. In mid-2012, after exchanging messages through the Arab state of Oman, Iranian and American officials secretly met to lay the groundwork for potential nuclear talks. This involved diplomats dispatched by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, including her close aide Jake Sullivan, now a top adviser to her presidential campaign. Talks became possible in June 2013, after Iranians elected as president a relatively moderate Iranian cleric, Hassan Rouhani. He offered the West a more conciliatory face than his hardline predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. With the apparent blessing of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on all state decisions in Iran, Rouhani spoke directly via phone with Obama in September 2013, kicking off the public phase of the nuclear talks. Despite a willingness to bargain over its nuclear program, Iran has pursued an aggressive foreign policy elsewhere in the Middle East, alarming its neighbors. For example, Iran is backing Syrian President Bashar Assad against Sunni groups trying to topple him. At the same time, Iranian-trained Shiite militias are indirectly helping U.S.-backed Iraqi troops trying to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group in Iraq. And in Yemen, Iran has backed the Houthi rebels, whose positions are being bombed by Saudi Arabia with U.S. assistance. Critics of the deal fear that once Iran starts to get relief from sanctions — including access to more than 100 billion in frozen assets — it will use the money to wreak more havoc in the region. U.S. officials argue that Iran’s regional meddling costs little, and that the country is more likely to direct the influx of funds to repairing its economy and its infrastructure. At the same time, Obama has promised more military aid to Arab countries and repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security. In many ways, the hardest part of the nuclear deal begins now, with its implementation. Congress will review the deal, and is likely to vote to prevent Obama from suspending sanctions on Iran — a measure Obama is sure to veto. In that scenario, the votes of a few dozen Senate Democrats could become decisive in a veto override battle. The nuclear deal will also drive the 2016 presidential campaign’s foreign policy debate. Several Republican contenders are already vowing to kill the deal if they win the White House.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answer to both questions asked, \\"What is the best sword?\\" and \\"What is the best type of sword in the world?\\" would indeed be closely related; however, the answer might not be exactly the same because of how these questions are framed, which focuses on separate aspects of the topic. In answering \\"What is the best sword?\\" it would be important to define what is meant by \\"best\\". Is it the sharpest, the most durable, the most historically significant, the most expensive or the most aesthetically pleasing? 'Best' is subjective and can refer to many different factors. For instance, some might argue that historically, the katana, a Japanese longsword used by samurai, is the best due to its sharpness, flexibility, and hardness. Others might argue that the Damascus Sword, known for its unique patterning and legendary sharpness, durability, and resistance to shattering, is the best. On the other hand, when trying to answer \\"What is the best type of sword in the world?\\" we would also need to consider cultural, historical, and practical aspects. Different types of swords have been developed throughout history and across cultures depending on the needs and resources of those societies. A Longsword from medieval Europe, for example, was designed for different kinds of warfare than a Scimitar from the Middle East or a Rapier from Renaissance Europe. Specific types of swords might include the Katana (Japan), Longsword (Europe), Jian (China), Scimitar (Middle East), Khopesh (Egypt), and Rapier (Renaissance Europe). Each type has distinctive features and was created to meet specific requirements. The Katana, for instance, is revered for its sharpness and is best for quick, precise cuts. The Longsword gives the best results in a range of fighting situations due to its balanced design. The Jian excels in precision and agility, making it suitable for subtle techniques as seen in several martial arts. A Scimitar is considered optimal for horseback combat due to its curved design, which is good for slashing. The Khopesh was technologically superior during its time, with its sickle-like shape offering both slashing and hooking capabilities. A Rapier, while limited in slashing effectiveness, is unmatched in offering quick thrusting attacks. The key point is that the concept of 'the best' can depend largely on the context and the criteria by which 'best' is judged. What works best in one scenario might not work as well in another. Thus, the best sword or sword type is fundamentally determined by what it is that you need or want the sword to do – whether that be display, collection, combat, historical reenactment or something else entirely. Therefore, while the answer to the two questions may indeed be similar, they should also address these individual aspects of each query. The responses could indeed reference the same types of swords based on these factors, but they could also differ based on how 'best' is interpreted in each context. The given options (i). no. (ii). yes. do not seem to relate to these questions as they imply a yes or no response. Both questions require a much more nuanced and detailed answer than a simple yes or no. Therefore, focusing purely on these options would neither adequately satisfy the questions nor necessarily provide a logically coherent response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: Over the dissents of three Justices, the Supreme Court on Tuesday evening barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its new abortion-restriction law — one part as it applied throughout the state, the other as it applied to two clinics in the southwest part of the state. The state may not now enforce a requirement that all clinics in the state upgrade their facilities to be hospital-like surgical centers, even when they perform abortions only through the use of drugs, not surgery. And it may not enforce, against the clinics in McAllen and El Paso, a requirement that all doctors performing abortions have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within thirty miles of the clinic. That requirement can continue to be enforced elsewhere in Texas, the Court indicated. Those two provisions, together, had reduced the number of clinics still operating in the state to seven, with an eighth soon to open. At one time recently, Texas had forty-one clinics. The Supreme Court’s action Tuesday will allow the reopening of thirteen closed clinics on Wednesday, lawyers for the clinics said. The Court’s order will remain in effect while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rules on a constitutional challenge to the two measures. That court had previously upheld the admitting privileges requirement as it applied all across the state. Most recently, it had blocked a new ruling by a judge in Austin that seemed to invalidate the two provisions statewide. The Supreme Court gave no explanation for the four-sentence order. It noted that Justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas would have refused to delay any part of the state requirements. They did not give their reasoning. It would have taken the votes of five Justices to block the provisions, so it appears that at least that number from among the other six Justices voted for the result. The Justices voting for the order were not noted. In asking the Court to set aside, temporarily, the Fifth Circuit’s orders permitting enforcement of the two provisions, lawyers for the clinics had said that clinics closed as a result probably would not reopen unless those restrictions were lifted. They also contended that there had recently been an increase in the number of women seeking illegal abortions in areas where clinics could no longer provide services. The seven clinics that were not affected by the new restrictions (and the eighth that is soon to open) were concentrated in the four largest metropolitan areas in the eastern part of the state. The lawyers had told the Court that, for the time being, there were no licensed facilities to provide abortions anywhere in the state south or west of San Antonio — “an area larger than most states.” Texas officials had urged the Supreme Court not to block the new measures, arguing that they were necessary to protect the health of pregnant women in the state. They also argued that the challengers had exaggerated the practical impact of the new restrictions, and that most women would continue to have access to abortions within what they said was a reasonable driving distance. The Fifth Circuit, in allowing the restrictions to go into or remain in effect, had found that they would not impose an “undue burden” on a significant fraction of the women in the state who would need abortion services. The Supreme Court’s order is not a final ruling on the constitutionality of the new limitations, but is a strong indication that the state may have difficulty defending them, at least as statewide measures. The Court’s order marked the first time in the Justices’ new Term that the abortion controversy had returned. There may be other tests of the Court’s current view on that controversy later in the Term. Recommended Citation: Lyle Denniston, Court blocks abortion limits in Texas, SCOTUSblog (Oct. 14, 2014, 7:08 PM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/court-blocks-abortion-limits-in-texas/ ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in America's second most-populous state. In an unsigned order, the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct. 2 ruling by a panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades. The court also put on hold a separate provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The admitting privileges remains in effect elsewhere in Texas. Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects. The 5th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping measure overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last year. But even as it weighs the merits of the law, the appeals court said that it can be enforced in the meantime — opening the door for the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The 5th Circuit decision had blocked an August ruling by Austin-based U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who had found that requiring hospital-style upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Yeakel's ruling temporarily suspended the upgrade rules before they could go into effect Sept. 1 — and the order from the Supreme Court means they are on hold again. Allowing the rules on hospital-level upgrades to be enforced — including mandatory operating rooms and air filtration systems — shuttered more than a dozen clinics across Texas. Until the nation's highest court intervened, only abortion facilities in the Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas remained open. And none was left along the Texas-Mexico border or outside any of the state's largest urban areas. Some other clinics, meanwhile, had closed even earlier amid enforcement of the rule on admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That portion has already been upheld twice by the appeals court. The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is the favorite in next month's governor's race, is leading the defense of the law. Critics call the measure a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions. Attorneys for the state have denied that Texas women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents, however, note that still leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion. Democrat Wendy Davis launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The Supreme Court has barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its 2013 abortion restriction law, enabling the reopening of 13 clinics. One part of the law blocked requires all state clinics to upgrade their facilities to be like hospital surgical centers, even those that perform abortions purely through the use of drugs. The replacement of this law applies throughout the state. The other aspect cannot be enforced against clinics in McAllen and El Paso which specify that all doctors performing these operations have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. This second requirement can continue elsewhere in Texas. The Supreme Court's order is only temporary and will remain in place while the Fifth Circuit Court rules on a constitutional challenge to these measures.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.

In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Hamden Khalif Allah Awad alias Ahmed the German ( actually Egyptian ) ( August 13 , 1970 -- August 7 , 1998 ) was one of the perpetrators of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .

It's not really about gymnastics; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery, or microbiology, or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it's about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abo's hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand at least they're in the movie. But D'Abo doesn't quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; it's all just bodies hurtling around, and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it's all performed by an obvious double.

Air is drawn in through the mouth: This step involves inhaling air, which brings oxygen into the body. No involvement of the perturbation (dishes stuck in the dishwasher) here. 2. The air goes down the esophagus: This step involves the passage of air through the esophagus towards the lungs. Again, no relationship with the perturbation. 3. The air moves into the lungs: The lungs are where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. The perturbation still doesn't affect this step. 4. The carbon dioxide is removed: Carbon dioxide is expelled from the body during exhalation. The perturbation has no impact on this step. 5. The remaining oxygen enters the body: The oxygen is transferred to the bloodstream to be utilized by the cells for energy production. The perturbation still has no influence on this process. 6. The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth: Once again, the process of exhaling and removing carbon dioxide from the body is not influenced by the perturbation.

In 2011, campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse royal assent.

If your home was built before 1978 and you want to renovate it, you should test the area first to check for lead. Testing kits are easy to use and available at most home improvement or hardware stores.","completion":"First, you need to purchase a testing kit suitable for testing lead paint. Once you have the testing kit, prepare the area that you intend to test by cleaning it with a damp cloth to remove dust or loose particles. This is important because lead can often be mixed with dust, and you want to ensure you are testing the surface paint and not contaminated dust. Following the instructions on the kit, typically you will need to rub a testing swab against the painted surface for a given amount of time or until the swab changes colour. If the swab changes to a specific colour (usually pink or red), this indicates the presence of lead. It's best to test in various places, including window sills, door frames, and walls - essentially, wherever there is paint. If the test comes back positive for lead, do not try to handle the situation yourself. While it may be tempting to try and remove the lead paint on your own, improper handling can lead to lead dust being released into the air, which can be harmful if inhaled, especially for children and pregnant women. Instead, contact professionals who are certified in lead removal. These professionals have the necessary training and equipment to safely remove or manage lead paint. This can involve a wide range of activities including enclosing the lead paint with a wall covering, painting over the lead paint with a special type of paint known as encapsulant, or completely removing the lead paint. In the meantime, limit access to the area proven to have lead paint, especially for children and pets. Keep the area clean by wet moping the surfaces and washing hands and toys often to reduce the risk of lead contamination. While the lead paint removal process may seem daunting, remember that it is a necessary precaution in ensuring the safety of your home. Always remember to take the proper precautions when dealing with lead paint and never hesitate to seek professional help if you are unsure."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize this article: If you’re collecting a sample from the tap, let the water run for at least 1 minute. Then, fill the glass so it’s at least ¾ of the way full. This is more than enough to spot anything out of the ordinary in a sample. For pools of water, scoop up a sample with the glass. You don’t need to sterilize the glass first. Think of the crystal clear water at a beautiful beach. Clean water looks transparent and doesn’t have anything floating in it. If you can’t see your hand on the other side of the glass, you’re probably not going to enjoy drinking that water. Anything floating in the glass could be a sign of bacteria or other problems. Before getting on the phone with your water department, set the glass down and wait for a minute. Sometimes milky water clears up right away. That means the color came from air bubbles, so your water is safe to drink. Hard water is water that has calcium, magnesium, and other minerals in it. The minerals cause the water to look a little cloudy. It is usually safe to drink but can be fixed with a water softener to avoid damage to your plumbing. Treat water with colored particles. For example, brown or orange particles are from rusty pipes while black ones come from rubber. Call a plumber to fix the problem. Even if your water doesn’t have anything floating in it, it may still not look completely clear. Discolored water not only looks gross but is a big red flag. These colors also turn up as stains on your dishes, clothing, bathtub, and other places. Use the strange coloring to figure out the source of the contamination before paying for a more comprehensive purity test. For instance, brown water is a very common problem. The contamination comes from dirt and other sediments, which you might see settle at the bottom of the glass. Red and orange colors come from rusty pipes. Black could mean you have lead in the water, a very toxic metal that also often comes from pipes. Green usually means algae grew in your water supply, so don’t drink it. If it has a blue-green coloring, it could be copper instead. A black stain could also mean mold. If the water smells bad, play it safe by assuming that it is going to be unsafe to drink. Sometimes water has that distinct rotten egg smell of sulfur, which comes from bacteria in the water. Other times, it could have the smell of a swimming pool because of chlorine contamination. If your water smells like nail polish or varnish, that could mean that some chemical leaked into the water supply. It might be from a home improvement project, for instance. Purify water by filtering and boiling it to remove contaminants. If you’re using municipal water, call your city or utility company. Contact your local government for more information. If you don’t see anything unusual about the water, taste a little bit of it with the tip of your tongue. You can usually detect polluted water right away. Bitterness often means metal in the water, so order a more complete water test as you look for problems. If you detect salt instead and live near the sea, seawater could be leaking into your plumbing. Clean water has a flat, bland taste. If your sample tastes metallic or like a fizzy soda, don’t risk drinking it. Keep in mind that you can’t always taste water quality issues. Things like bacteria and pesticides may not be easy to detect. Normally you can tell by looking at the water, but double-check with a lab test if necessary. Summary:","completion":"Okay kiddo, imagine that you and I are detectives. We are going to solve a mystery about how our water looks or tastes. First, if we want to test our tap water, we let it run for a little bit, then fill up a glass. If we're checking a pool of water, we just scoop some up. The water should look clear, with nothing floating in it - like a beautiful beach. If we can't see our hand through the glass, it might not be good to drink. If something's floating, there could be germs or other yucky stuff. But sometimes, we might just see tiny bubbles which are harmless. Sometimes, our water might look cloudy because it has minerals like calcium and magnesium, which is okay to drink but could be a little hard on our pipes. We might also see weird colors in the water. For example, brown or orange colors could mean rusty pipes, while black could be because of rubber or even a dangerous thing called lead. We might even see green color because of algae, or a blue-green color from copper. If it smells bad, like a rotten egg or nail polish, it could have bacteria or chemicals in it. And guess what, if it tastes bitter it might have metal in it, or even seawater if we live near the beach. If the water tastes, smells or looks funny, we shouldn't drink it. Sometimes, we might not be able to taste or see anything wrong, but we can send a sample to a lab to make sure it's safe.

It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of \\" style over substance\\" I couldn't disagree more. I believe that \\" Domino \\" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career. After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as \\"Crimson Tide\\" Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing. This was then carried through to \\" Enemy Of The State\\" and \\"Spy Game\\" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. \\" Man On Fire\\" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in \\" Domino\\" Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation \\" Domino\\" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have \\" traces of mescaline\\" in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting. It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the \\"90210\\" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip. To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in \\" Domino\\" is in the surface and the surface is everything. I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive. The reviewer enthusiastically praises \\"Domino\\" and its director, Tony Scott, arguing passionately against detractors who condemn the movie for its alleged superficiality and frenzied style. In the review, the author asserts that \\"Dominos\\" is not just an action movie, but a cinematically rich exploration of the main character's subjective experience, with highly intentioned stylistic and aesthetic choices. The reviewer highlights how Scott's changing stylistic techniques over different movies culminated in \\"Domino\\", creating a visual narrative that represents the disarrayed memories of the main character. Moreover, the reviewer admires how Scott, together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams, crafted a vivid depiction of contemporary American culture, evoking the loss of innocence through the journey of the underprivileged children in the movie. The reviewer implies that \\"Dominos\\" is similar to the works of Picasso or Pollock, where the surface, though not traditionally \\"realistic\\", is full of meaning and depth. Finally, the reviewer emotionally asserts their independent status, fervently stating their unwavering admiration for Tony Scott's work. Therefore, the reviewer not only provides their resounding endorsement for \\"Domino\\" but also expresses their deep respect for Tony Scott's career, viewing him as an avant-garde filmmaker whose visionary style elevates his movies into an expressionist art form on par with great paintings. Overall, the sentiment of this review is strongly supportive, appreciative, and adulatory."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Durer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Durer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naive approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Durer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Durer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'. In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Durer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \\"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.\\" Question: \\"How many years passed between the first and final drafts of Durer's essay on aesthetics?\\" Answer: \\"16 years had passed since his first draft\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. 16 years passed between the first draft in 1512 and the final draft in 1528 of Durer's essay on aesthetics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing.

Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone.

So, the simplified equation is -17*k + 17 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable k To isolate the variable k, we must get k on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side. In this case, we will move the +17 to the right side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation. -17*k + 17 - 17 = 0 - 17 This simplifies to: -17*k = -17 Step 3: Solve for k Now we need to solve for k. Since k is being multiplied by -17, we must divide both sides of the equation by -17 to get k by itself. -17*k / -17 = -17 / -17 This simplifies to: k = 1 So the solution to the equation -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 is k = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions? Two villages are inhabited by lots of people that ride bicycles. Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days. Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","completion":"Hill village has more dangerous cycling conditions. The paragraph states that Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, which can create slippery conditions. This increases the risk of loss of control for cyclists, especially those who ride brakeless and have to brake through the drivetrain.

Fact 2: Folding and metamorphic rock Folding is caused by slow compression and the rock responds by bending. Given the two facts above, what caused the Himalayas to form? Answer:","completion":"The formation of the Himalayas is a complex and fascinating geological process, which can be understood in conjunction with the two facts provided above. The cause behind the formation of this majestic mountain range can be linked to the theory of plate tectonics and the interactions between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Plate tectonics is a theory in Earth science that describes the large-scale motion and interaction of Earth's lithosphere, the outermost solid shell of our planet that is made up of the crust and the upper mantle. The lithosphere is fragmented into a number of mobile tectonic plates that are in constant motion, albeit at a very slow rate. These plates float on Earth's semi-fluid asthenosphere and move due to the convection currents generated by heat generated within Earth's interior. The formation of the Himalayas can be traced back to around 50 million years ago when the Indian Plate, which was part of the ancient continent Gondwana, began to move northwards and collided with the Eurasian Plate. This continental collision, known as the Indo-Asian Collision, initiated the formation of the Himalayas through a series of geological processes, including folding and the formation of metamorphic rocks. As stated in Fact 1, the Himalayas were formed by rock folding. Folding is a geological process wherein rocks bend and deform under immense pressure and stress, typically caused by the horizontal compression forces exerted during the collision of tectonic plates. In the case of the Himalayas, the immense pressure created during the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate led to the deformation and bending of the rock layers along the boundary. As the Indian Plate continued to push against the Eurasian Plate, layers of rock were squeezed, compressed, and bent, forming the folded mountain ranges that characterize the Himalayas. This process is still ongoing, as evidenced by the fact that the height of the Himalayas continues to increase each year. Folding and the formation of metamorphic rock, as mentioned in Fact 2, are closely related processes. Metamorphic rock forms when pre-existing rock undergoes changes in response to variations in temperature, pressure, or chemical conditions. During the formation of the Himalayas, the intense stress and pressure experienced by the rocks at the boundary of the colliding plates were sufficient to induce metamorphism. As the rocks bent and deformed, they were also transformed into metamorphic rocks like gneiss, schist, and marble, which can be found throughout the Himalayan range today. In conclusion, the formation of the Himalayas was driven by the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate during the process of plate tectonics. This continental collision led to folding and deformation of the rocks along the plate boundary due to immense pressure and stress, as well as the formation of metamorphic rocks. The continuous movement and interaction between these tectonic plates mean that the Himalayas are still undergoing these geological processes and continue to evolve over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Timmy's favorite part of the day was the ice cream treat his mom bought him from a little ice cream cart. The sun was shining brightly, and the cold, sweet ice cream melted as it ran down his hand. Timmy couldn't stop giggling as he licked his hand to catch the drips. As the sun began to set, Timmy's family gathered to watch the beautiful fireworks display. Timmy's eyes sparkled as the colors exploded in the sky, and he imagined that they were surrounded by a rainbow of shimmering stars. Timmy went to sleep that night with a smile on his face, so grateful for the amazing day at Paragon Park. As he grew older, he never forgot the special time he spent with his family on that unforgettable trip. And so, many years later, whenever Timmy talks about his childhood, he always says, \\"We have many fond memories of this childhood trip.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court., can you guess it ?

Translate to Romanian","completion":"Cu toate acestea, ne confruntăm cu o serie de provocări serioase. România, ca orice altă țară, este într-adevăr confruntată cu numeroase provocări serioase care afectează diferite aspecte ale societății. În primul rând, să examinăm unele dintre cele mai pregnante probleme cu care se confruntă România în prezent: 1. Economie: Economia românească este în continuă creștere și dezvoltare, dar avansează încet comparativ cu alte țări din Uniunea Europeană. Problemele care afectează economia includ nivelurile ridicate ale datoriei publice, infrastructura slabă și corupția. 2. Educație: Sectorul educației este încă afectat de subfinanțare și lipsa resurselor, ceea ce duce la rezultate slabe ale elevilor și scăderea calității învățământului. 3. Sănătate: Sistemul de sănătate românesc se confruntă cu provocări majore, cum ar fi lipsa personalului medical, lipsa echipamentelor și resurselor necesare pentru oferirea unei îngrijiri medicale adecvate, precum și corupția la nivel înalt. 4. Mediu: Poluarea și degradarea mediului sunt probleme grave în România, având în vedere ratele ridicate de emisii de gaz cu efect de seră, tăierile ilegale de păduri și problemele legate de calitatea apei. 5. Corupție și guvernanță: România continuă să lupte cu corupția la toate nivelurile guvernamentale, conducând la o gestionare ineficientă și lipsirea de încredere a cetățenilor în instituții. Eforturile de eradicare a corupției, întreprinse pe plan național și în colaborare cu alte țări și organizații internaționale, încă sunt în desfășurare. 6. Demografie și migrație: Populația României este în scădere din cauza ratei reduse a natalității, a îmbătrânirii populației și a emigrației forței de muncă, în special către țări din Europa de Vest cu economii mai dezvoltate. Aceasta provoacă lipsa forței de muncă și pune presiune pe finanțele publice. 7. Justiție socială: Inechitatea de venit, sărăcia și excluziunea socială afectează o mare parte din populația României, în special în zonele rurale și în rândul comunităților marginalizate, precum romii. 8. Securitate internă și externă: România își consolidează securitatea internă și externă, în special în contextul relațiilor dificile cu vecinii săi, Rusia și Republica Moldova, și al rolului său în NATO. Aceste provocări demonstrează amploarea problemelor pe care România trebuie să le abordeze pentru a asigura o dezvoltare armonioasă și durabilă a țării. Cu toate acestea, potențialul pentru schimbări pozitive există și se întrevede prin eforturile crescânde ale societății civile, ale guvernului și ale actorilor internaționali de a le aborda într-o manieră concertată și eficientă."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Consumer electronics once again topped the list of the most wanted gifts this holiday season. \\"Seventy-six percent of consumers who plan to buy holiday gifts say that they will spend money or buy at least one technology product; definitely a solid vote of confidence for technology.\\" Steve Koenig is with the Consumer Electronics Association.

Is the premise \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive.\\" true if \\"A young man is on Mars.\\"?","completion":"In order to address the relationship between the two premises, we must first break down and analyze both statements separately and then consider their connections, if any. Premise 1: \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive.\\" This statement describes a specific scenario in which a young Asian man is seated behind a chessboard, presumably prepared for a match, and waiting for his opponent to join him. The context of this statement is limited to the chessboard, the young Asian man, and the impending arrival of another player. The location where this situation takes place is not explicitly mentioned. Premise 2: \\"A young man is on Mars.\\" This statement describes a different scenario wherein a young man is located on Mars, which is irrelevant to the game of chess itself. Again, the context of this statement is limited to the young man and the planet Mars. There is no mention of an Asian background or his involvement in any activities, such as playing chess. Furthermore, Mars' involvement suggests a potentially futuristic or hypothetical setting since no human has set foot on Mars yet in reality. Considering both premises, it becomes evident that there is no direct connection or relationship between them. The two statements refer to two distinct scenarios with no discernible overlapping elements that could tie them together. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to automatically assume that the young man on Mars is, in fact, the same young Asian man waiting behind the chessboard. Given the limited information provided in both premises and the lack of apparent connection between them, one cannot conclude that premise 1 is true if premise 2 is true. It is vital to establish a connecting link between the young Asian man behind the chessboard and the young man on Mars before considering whether the two statements can hold true simultaneously. Such a link could involve specifying if there is chess playing involved on Mars or further identifying the location of the chess match mentioned in the first premise. In conclusion, based on the provided information and the lack of connections between both premises, it cannot be definitively concluded whether \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive\\" is true if \\"A young man is on Mars.\\" More information or context is necessary to establish a connection between the two situations and hence reach a valid conclusión."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There' s no evidence that when a dog or cat is eating grass in the front yard, it' s going to rain. But then, there's no evidence that it isn't going to rain, either. Doctors think dogs and cats eat grass to help make their stomach better or maybe just because they like the taste of it. You'll get sick if you go outside in cold weather with wet hair. False.

Many churches have prevented people from throwing rice at weddings because the rice grows larger in a bird's stomach when eaten, causing the bird to explode . True and false. It's true many churches have prevented people from throwing rice, but this is more likely because the rice can become slick on a road or street. There's nothing about rice that will hurt birds. Rice is an important part of many bird's food. Chocolate is Poisonous to dogs. True. Chocolate has theobromine, which can make your dog sick.

Lot's to talk about including the unfortunate (alleged) Jon Gosselin affair, Paula Abdul's sudden admission of a painkiller addiction and Lindsay Lohan... just because. Oh, and looking ahead to Saturday night's White House Correspondents Dinner. Though after the star-studded inauguration we went through only a few months back, the WHCA Dinner doesn't seem like as big of a deal this year. We'll see -- I did hear a rumor that Tom Cruise may show up and, much to Jen Chaney's delight, Jason Bateman will be in attendance. Here's a list of all the star power expected to be on hand -- so far. Let's get started... Possum Island: Dear Liz, I've been thinking lately about the whole celeb/famous person privacy/publicity balance. Specifically Elizabeth Edwards's book and Sara Jessica/Matthew B.'s surrogate thing. I mean, obviously these are public figures, and anything that happens to them is news. Mrs. Edwards's husband confessed to his affair publicly. Does it then follow that Mrs. Edwards writes a book about it? And I'm happy for SJ/MB, but now of course everyone wants to know who the surrogate is, and her family is under the microscope. After having \\"exposed\\" themselves, will they all eventually say, \\"I'm a victim of the media/paparazzi?\\" What do you think? Thanks. Liz Kelly: This is a well-thought out query. I'll do my best to make some sense here. This goes back to the whole privacy line debate we had here last week and have talked about several times over the years. There is definitely a line and, yes, certain sectors of the press can be a bit overzealous in their pursuit of private details about the lives of public figures. It sucks, but it comes with the territory. Which is why I am still somewhat amazed by people who enter into public life -- be it a politician or an actor -- and then proceed to leave themselves wide open to the vipers who are always waiting in the wings hoping for a hot scoop. At this point one has to know it comes with the territory. It may not be right, but there it is. And as absurd as some of this stuff is -- Star Magazine, ahem -- it is part of the price of having a free press and that's not something I'm willing to trade in. I think the Elizabeth Edwards book is a different issue. We're still in the privacy realm, but I'm tempted to say that the issue with Edwards is more about profiting from pain -- her own, her husbands, her childrens' and that of the supposed Edwards love child. Maureen Dowd said it better: But it's just a gratuitous peek into their lives, and one that exposes her kids, by peddling more dregs about their personal family life in a book, and exposes the ex-girlfriend who's now trying to raise the baby girl, a dead ringer for John Edwards, in South Orange, N.J. I have a lot of respect for Elizabeth Edwards and think she could have written a compelling worthwhile book without inflicting more pain. Is it a violation of privacy? Yes. But I suppose if anyone is entitled to violate it, then it is Elizabeth herself. Liz Kelly: RE: SJP's surrogate, apparently she's been unmasked as something of a wild child. And here's a link to the Maureen Dowd column referenced above. Throw your sister under the bus for Us Weekly: Who knows if Jon Gosselin is cheating or not - but that guy who who claims his sister is the mistress is as bad as the loser who ratted out Michael Phelps with the pot pics. Something tells me it is going to be a very unhappy Thanksgiving at the bro and sis house this year. Liz Kelly: That family kind of loses either way, eh? The ballad of Kiefer Sutherland: Clearly KS has issues. The intriguing/confusing aspect to the story is the weirdness coming out of Brooke Shields' camp - her reps say they don't know why Kiefer headbutted the designer, but they also claim ignorance on whether she was pushed or whatever. (If they are authorized to speak for her, you would think they would get the full story first.) washingtonpost.com: EW: Brooke Shields' rep contradicts Kiefer Sutherland Liz Kelly: Three years ago Tom Cruise almost lost his career trying to save Brooke Shields from antidepressants. Now Kiefer Sutherland is charged with assault for defending her honor and may end up back in jail. A coincidence or is Brooke Shields the unlucky tiki of the celebrity set? Andrew Morton's Angelina book: Rarely do I believe anything Star magazine says, but surely if their story is accurate Morton should have a monster libel case on his hands. The first line of the cover story from this week's issue reads, \\"Angelina Jolie is a jealous, cunning liar who cheated on Brad with a famous rock star, schemed to lure him away from Jennifer Aniston -- and even slept with her own mother's boyfriend!\\" Liz Kelly: Hot diggity! That sounds like good summer beach reading. Jon Gossel, IN: I've watched the show some. Their kids have the same age spread as mine and on a smaller level, I can relate to their trials and tribulations. So last week, I stumbled into the land of Kate Hate. It's a rough and tumble land, current capital, Detroit. But this week, the details are coming out about Jon. Wow. Who in their right mind would sign up for a reality show when their personal life is falling apart? Oh, I'm sorry, I believe Bobby Brown, Hulk Hogan, and several \\"Real Housewives\\" have already answered that question. If I were Kate, I would say, \\"Go have your affair...only you have to have it with Nadya Suleman.\\" Liz Kelly: Again, this goes back to the question of private details about public lives. And while I don't have any emotional investment in either Jon or Kate (tho the eight are pretty irresistible), I'm sorry to see their dirty laundry being aired so publicly. Two things to remember: Specific to this case: We don't know that Jon actually had an affair, although it probably wasn't the best idea for him to go clubbing with some woman who is not his wife. In general: Humans are fallible. Even humans who score TV contracts or recording deals or walk red carpets and make millions of dollars a year. Funny-ish story: I'm on the elevator and two middle-aged men get on. One guy keeps saying, \\"I think it was Renee Zellweger\\" and other is like, \\"Really, was it like 10 minutes?\\" At this point, I'm like, what are these people talking about in the elevator? Then they go quiet and when they are about to get off the elevator, one guy says, \\"I think it was Kirsten Dunst.\\" The other says, \\"No, I'm pretty sure it was Renee Zellweger.\\" \\"Wasn't it for like 5 minutes or a couple of hours?\\" \\"Nah, I think we're talking months here...\\" I finally realized they were talking about a quickie marriage. Definitely Renee, not Kirsten, yes? Liz Kelly: Oh, definitely Renee. Has anyone out there seen \\"Apaloosa?\\" A perfectly good Western utterly ruined by Renee Zellweger. Even Kirsten Dunst would have been an improvement. ishkabible: The Daily Beast, a mostly intellectual online news source, had a 3-page article about Heincer. I was devastated. It was like discovering the ants you thought were ONLY in your kitchen are now in the upstairs bed room. I thought about forwarding it to you Liz, for gems like, \\"The paparazzi are like family members to us\\" and \\"You're gonna have to pry Speidi's fame from our dead hands.\\" But THEN I read: \\"a post about me gets like 2,000 of the most evil comments. But I'm motivated by those reactions....They keep me going. It's juice. It's power. Persecute me, please.\\" Well played, you little prat. I put the matter before Liz, Producer Paul, and the collective wisdom of the Celebritology community. Would it be better to engage in the snarkfest Heincer so RICHLY deserves, or pretend we didn't notice them? The article in question: The Speidi Chronicles Liz Kelly: It's a lose-lose situation. Actually, maybe even lose-lose-lose. Kiefer, continued: What I find interesting about this whole kerfuffle is that Brooke Shields has to be substantially taller than Kiefer. I know he's Jack Bauer and all but how exactly does she need defending from a designer? Liz Kelly: Well, tall doesn't necessarily mean strong. But I would guess the difference is actually that Brooke Shields has some self control. WHCA Dinner : Jon Hamm and John Cusack?! Dear gawd...I need a ticket... Liz Kelly: Yes -- and although I'm not getting fully decked out (I'll be working, after all) my get-up is totally \\"Mad Men\\"-esque. I'm sure that'll make all the difference. College Radio: I teach at the school that hosts a radio station I've been listening to since I moved to the area. I have a total girl-crush on the station manager, the way the Fug-girls have a crush on Kelly Clarkson (\\"hey let's go have hot wings and drink beer and talk about boys!\\") But beyond our mutual employer, I have NO reason to start up a conversation or even run into her. (I teach night classes and don't really see other faculty or even go to department meetings.) So aside from walking into the station and saying \\"hey! You don't know me, but you seem like you kick ass. Wanna have lunch?\\" what is the least creepiest way I can meet this person? (I know this is sort of a Haxian question, but it's about a LOCAL celebrity, so I'm hoping you'll take it.) Liz Kelly: I'm going to open this up for suggestions... me, I'm not convinced there's a way to do this that won't seem weird. Anything I can think of just seems way too forced. I do feel your pain, though. I have totally been there. And I still think Russell Crowe and I would get along really well. Jason Bateman: Compared to his sister Justine, who started out on the very successful Family Ties series, Jason (who I first remember seeing in \\"Teen Wolf, Too\\") seems to have trod a much happier career path, playing nicely etched roles in movies like \\"Juno\\" and \\"State of Play.\\" Is he leading man material? I don't know -- not sure he takes himself that seriously. Liz Kelly: I think he's leading man material and I don't think he has to take himself seriously to move into that territory. And although \\"Arrested Development\\" was an ensemble show, it could be argued that Jason led that ensemble. I first remember him, btw, from \\"Family Ties,\\" on which he showed up from time to time as a friend of Ricky's. Along with Alfonso Ribiero (whose name I am probably butchering). Brad and Jen Meet-Up?: What do you make of this tale? Who has a movie coming out momentarily? (other than \\"Ben Button\\" on DVD) Liz Kelly: If memory serves, that particular \\"story\\" originated in Star Magazine, which -- as far as I can tell -- is written using Mad Libs books and a rotating list of celebrity names. Dork, Us: Okay, so I come out of two month Celebritology exile to find that Lilo and Jon Mayer are single again, as well as Farrah Fawcett having anal cancer, and Dom Delouise died. What other major events have I missed? Can I get a pic of Scarlet Johansson? Liz, I think I'm getting Scarletted out. We might need to retire her and solicit replacement ideas. Liz Kelly: I never thought I'd see the day when Paul tired of ScarJo. I'm curious as to who is on his kitchen list now. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? What did you miss? Hmm -- I'm assuming you know about Mel Gibson's divorce and young Russian girlfriend. Bawlmer, Hon: Thanks for the WHCD guest list! Do you know how one obtains tickets to the dinner? Was there any infighting this year over who got tickets and who didn't? And how is Ashton Kutcher going under CNN's name? Strange. Liz Kelly: News organizations buy tables and distribute the tickets as they see fit -- to people within the org and guests, who tend to be celebs and politicians. I won't actually be heading into the dinner, but instead covering the much more interesting pre-parties that basically take over every inch of the Hilton on Saturday eve. More Keifer and Brooke: If the designer Keifer assaulted was responsible for the \\"hat\\" Brooke Sheilds wore to the Kentucky Derby, then he deserved a headbutt. washingtonpost.com: No joke. She looks like something from \\"Super Mario Brothers.\\" Liz Kelly: That whole outfit is just wrong. Though I rarely see a star who can carry off a hat well. Some recent examples of stars who can: Drew Barrymore, Aretha Franklin. Usually, though, they just look like kids playing dress up. Why is that? Women used to look stunning in hats. Kal Penn: What are the chances of getting Kal to do a WashPost chat? He clearly has a huge fan base amongst the chatters, he could use it as a platform to discuss whatever the White House wants him to discuss, and a producer would be able to screen out all of the phone numbers and virtual panties. washingtonpost.com: This would depend on my competence and professionalism. So, slim. Liz Kelly: Paul is fishing for compliments. He knows he is a rock star. As for Kal, I'm guessing it wouldn't be out of the question to get him online. But, remember, the White House Web site does their own version of online chats so they may want him chatting exclusively on the administration's site. Quatch: Liz, Who is the MC for the White House Correspondents Dinner? I didn't see Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Lewis Black or any other Comedy Central people in the guest list. Did I overlook them? Liz Kelly: It's Wanda Sykes -- hometown girl made good. She used to work for the NSA, though I'm not sure what her job entailed. 15th and L: Were you there when Stephen Colbert spoke at the White House Correspondents dinner a couple years ago? I have loved him ever since. Best line of the night, \\"Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in 'reality'. And reality has a well-known liberal bias.\\" washingtonpost.com: Interesting address, 15th and L. Colbert Roasts President Bush - 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner Liz Kelly: That was the one I missed, sadly. Though I watched on C-SPAN -- which is, arguably, a better experience anyhow. Jason Bateman: \\"Family Ties\\" -- of course, you meant \\"Silver Spoons.\\" Justine actually quit acting for a long time, and only recently came back to it. She had a role on \\"Desperate Housewives\\" a couple of seasons ago, and did something else recently that is escaping me at the moment... Liz Kelly: Yes, I meant \\"Silver Spoons.\\" My mind is much from staying up until the wee hours writing \\"Lost\\" analysis. Non-fans will be pleased to learn that next week is the last episode until January 2010. Washington, DC: Come on Liz! We all know know that you had a front row seat for the biggest celebrity scoop of the week. So, spill it. How was the reunion between Page and Sally? Pictures! We want pictures. Liz Kelly: There was a pic in the article. Honestly, we didn't get many. It was raining and we were trying to wrangle two dogs and cameras at the same time. Page isn't usually too friendly with other dogs, but she was okay with Sally. I think Sally was just calm enough to not set Page on edge. Sally, btw, is a total sweetheart. College Radio:: Friend her on Facebook. Add a message about how you work there too and love her show. Over time, become friendly online. Eventually you can ask her \\"out.\\" It's like online dating, only weirder. wink. Liz Kelly: That's a thought... Facebook does seem to breed an odd kind of intimacy. Jason Bateman and Alfonso Ribeiro: You meant, \\"Silver Spoons,\\" right? Now I've got that theme song in my head for the rest of the afternoon! washingtonpost.com: I'll trade you for the \\"Family Ties\\" theme. Liz Kelly: Last night Jen Chaney and I both had the \\"Macgruber\\" theme stuck in our heads. It was painful. Washington, DC: I am obsessed with Twilight and Robert Pattinson. Alas, I am no teenager -- in my forties, married with kids. Can you help me? Liz Kelly: Does it help to know you are not alone and that there are legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? Speaking of which, Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. Liz Kelly: And just so we don't give the cats short shrift, here's a short video of Andy. The sound is bad and the camera work shaky, but that hasn't stopped me from watching it three or four times already. Washington, D.C.: Can I please have a picture of Andy. The guy I've been dating just told me his feelings for me faded while I am totally in to him. Yes, I am very aware of how pathetic this request is, but my cat lives 2,500 miles away with my mom. And, I can't even claim that I'm in college. She just choose her when I moved years ago. Oh, God. I'm that girl. Andy! Please! Stat! Liz Kelly: Oh no -- I'm glad I posted that video. You need it. And I know I'm biased, but Andy's better than your loser ex anyway. Prince Harry: I read that he is going to have an official USA visit this summer. Any chance he is coming to the DC area? Liz Kelly: I can't imagine he'd come all the way across the pond without a visit to the White House, but I haven't seen any details yet. Kal Penn: Did you see the press release about the \\"Harold and Kumar\\" Christmas movie that will come out in 2010? I need details as to how that is working. In other news, my life has been a little better now that Kal Penn has started tweeting more. Liz Kelly: I actually talked about that with Kal and John Cho when I interviewed them at ComicCon last July. Apparently the company that owns the \\"Harold and Kumar\\" franchise announced plans for a new movie last summer, but hadn't yet bothered to secure either Kal or John for the film. And, according to IMDB, the project still doesn't have any talent attached. Andy, Feline Valentino?: If I were a girl cat, I would be totally crushing on Andy. That come-hither look and mysterious smile; the guy wouldn't even need to show up with a nosegay of catnip... Liz Kelly: I know. It's ridiculous. And that white patch of hair on his chest/neck totally looks like he's wearing a dress shirt or a dickie. He's just naturally debonair. Possum Island: Re: College Radio, Have you actually seen this person? Because I once had a blind date with a DJ that I had only heard on radio/talked to on the phone, and man was I disappointed (actually frightened is more like it!) Liz Kelly: Wasn't that a movie? Jason Bateman: Not Family Ties, Silver Spoons. And I had a crush on him more than Rick(y) Schroeder. Plus, he was on \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and had a short-lived but brilliant sitcom called \\"It's Your Move.\\" I'm no longer a stalker. Liz Kelly: Just to make sure -- I did clarify that I meant \\"Silver Spoons,\\" yes? Page and Sally!: I had a similar experience with my family's dog, Jeter. I volunteer with a rescue in the are, and my parents brought him to visit, socialize and get microchipped. While we were there, another couple walks up with their dog. Zeno was the spitting image of Jeter, just lankier and 15lbs lighter. In more celebritological news, any good locales for celeb-watching this weekend? washingtonpost.com: When you play ball with Jeter, does he have to play extra deep because he's lost a step and can no longer make routine plays? Liz Kelly: A sports joke. In my chat. I'm going to cry. As for celeb watching, the Hilton is the prime spot. Usually there is a roped off fan area set up along the red carpet. But judging from years past, it is loaded with teenaged girls. So, be warned. Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. : He's 26! You're fine! Liz Kelly: Ehrm, no. He's 20. No man, No Cat, D.C.: Thank you. That was enough. I can finish my work today. Liz Kelly: Well, at least wait until 2 p.m. to get started. Bernie Madoff: The Movie: I'm thinking an old-time SNL reunion feature. Jon Lovitz as Madoff, Jane Curtin as the wife, and Nora Dunn as the newly surfaced tell-all assistant. (Lovitz already played the villain in the sendup of \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" so he has the role down pat.) washingtonpost.com: Wow, I had forgotten this was the episode Shatner hosted! Liz Kelly: I love that clip -- we showed that one last December in Weingarten's chat, too. It never gets old. Houston: Thanks for letting us bend your ear -as an alum of a Kentucky university, I have to set the record straight on the Brooke Shields hat thing - the traditional thing for high society women to do at the Kentucky Derby is to wear an ornate, over the top, hat. And the Derby is about nothing, if not tradition. Sort of like at some churches, ladies wear really elaborate headgear. So, as for the hat, Brooke was just doing in Rome what the Romans do. Liz Kelly: But \\"ornate, over the top\\" does not necessarily have to mean \\"ugly,\\" does it? Query: Can we qualify any future Lindsay Lohan work as \\"having no talent attached\\"? Justine actually quit acting for a long time: She was battling anorexia. Liz Kelly: That must have been after \\"Satisfaction,\\" in which she played the leader of an all girl beach band who was romancing a music producer played by Liam Neeson. Brooke Shields: And Andre Agassi didn't start winning again until after they split! Liz Kelly: The plot thickens. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? : No and No. I vote for Rachel Bilson. Mena from \\"That 70s Show.\\" washingtonpost.com: I think you mean Mila Kunis from \\"That '70s Show\\"? Or do you mean Mila in addition to Rachel? I'm confused. I'm leaning toward Robin Scherbatsky. legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? : You think that's bad? I know a married mother in her 50s who belongs to an online fan club for adult fans of Hanson. Owe the humanity! washingtonpost.com: I don't know if that's at typo or pun. Liz Kelly: It's a pun, Paul. A longtime entry in the Official Celebritology Glossary. Can I just say that I came into the building today to work because I have a few meetings. I went to the trouble of reserving a conference room so I could have my accustomed solitude while chatting. Too bad there's some kind of morale building sales meeting in the next conference room over. I think there may be role-playing and team building happening. It sounds like Grand Central Station. re: Pattinson: I, too, am struggling with an age inappropriate crush on Pattinson. Read some of the interviews he's done where he admits his total paranoia about being overwhelmed by fans or getting stabbed by someone in a crowd. GQ's interview was great. He seems to be someone who truly regrets becoming famous. Admittedly, I still have a crush on him, but now I feel BAD about it. (And you are right on about Cera. Tell Gene to shut his mouth.) washingtonpost.com: GQ: HE'S HOT, HE'S SEXY, HE'S UNDEAD Liz Kelly: Thank you and thank you. Olney, MD: FYI: Justine Bateman was last seen in several episodes of \\"Men in Trees\\" at the end of its first season which became the shows second season because of the writers strike. ABC canceled the series last season. Liz Kelly: Thank you -- and Producer Paul reminds me that Julia Roberts was also in \\"Satisfaction.\\" Brooke Shields: You know, if Brooke had added a couple more inches to her Derby outfit, no one would be taking about it. It looks like it's 2 sizes too small - not that she doesn't fit in it, but that the waist is too high, the v neck too low and the hemline too high. Liz Kelly: Dress too small, hat too big. Boston: Just want to say that \\"Ick. Nast\\" is my new quote of the summer. Stay classy, Jon's alleged's mistresses' brother! (My other quote is \\"Stay out of it Nick Lachey!\\" thanks to the Soup. Do you watch it? I love it). Liz Kelly: Yes. I watch and love. And \\"Stay out of it, Nick Lachey\\" was classic. Ner,DO: Just throwing this out there, but Justine Batement played a hooker on Arrested Development who tried to pickup Jason Bateman's character and ended up being his sister. The episode was titled Family Ties. I think it was one of the last episodes of the show. And yes, I'm already in line for the opening of the movie. Liz Kelly: That must have been in the third season -- which Mr. Liz and I started watching, but soon stopped after we realized there had been a serious decline in quality. Does it get better again? Replacement: Easy: Minka Kelley - shes going to be in DC for a while now too! washingtonpost.com: I'm not even sure she's the best looking woman on \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" I'll take Mrs. Coach. New Crush for Producer Paul: Miss California washingtonpost.com: She is what an ex-roommate of mine referred to as \\"Dirty Hot.\\" Liz Kelly: What is this, Maxim online? Falls Church, Va.: I'm sorry but I just don't get the appeal of Jennifer Garner. She's not very pretty (the angular face, puffy lips, stick out ears.....maybe pretty for an average woman but not a movie star). And then starring in awful AWFUL movies like \\"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\\"...tell me, what's her appeal? Is she the luckiest woman on Earth to be so famous or what? washingtonpost.com: For guys, I posit it begins with the post 2006 Super Bowl episode of \\"Alias\\" where she beat up a plane full of bad guys in her underwear. She was the one in her underwear, to clarify. Liz Kelly: I think she's attractive. She's not classically beautiful, but she's got an interesting angular face and she's in fab shape. Much like Hillary Swank. And don't forget that in addition to \\"dirty hot,\\" there's also what we dubbed \\"ugly pretty\\" a couple of years back. People who are somehow not all that attractive, but you crush on them for some unknown reason. Vincent Gallo is one of these for me. Julia Roberts: So last night I was watching Green Day do American Idiot for VH1 Storytellers or whatever it's called, and at the end, there was a DMB video for a song called \\"Dreamgirl\\" and Julia Roberts was in it. (I may be wholly behind the times here, but I rarely watch \\"music\\" tv.) I just thought that was kind of weird, and doesn't she have better things to do? Also, ever since I saw Dave Matthews play a gifted but retarded man on \\"House\\" I can't help but think of him in that role at all times. Liz Kelly: That song and vid are a few years old, right? Just Curious: Why was the item about the passing of Stanley Tucci's wife in the \\"Rumor Mill\\" section of today's column? Seems he confirmed it to the NY Post. Liz Kelly: The version I saw was not confirmed. And the only other place I could find the story was Contact Music, which was a direct pull of the NY Post blurb. Maybe they've since updated? Question for the ages: Liz, which one of your chats do you love the most? (almost as bad as asking which pet you love the most) Liz Kelly: I love all of my chats equally, though for different reasons. Wanda Sykes for the White House Correspondants: Isn't that a little too obvious? Black president so we have to get a black comedian to MC? Having said that, she is hilarious. Liz Kelly: I think you're reading a little too much into this. Carm down. Liz Kelly: Okay -- apologies, but I need to run to the loo before I switch gears for the \\"Lost\\" chat.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA.

Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland.

It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What increases blood flow to the body's surface?\\" is \\"Blood vessels widen\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right! When blood vessels in the skin widen, or dilate, it increases blood flow to the body's surface, and this helps us to stay cool by letting more heat escape from our body. Good job understanding!"},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Who initiated the replacement of Dowding?\\" Context: \\"Whitehall's disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Whitehall initiated the replacement of Dowding due to their disquiet at the failures of the RAF."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Competitors on May The Best House Win – the popular Channel 4 programme in which four houseproud people judge one another’s homes – generally abide by an unwritten rule. It states that when the show is over, all agree it was a fair contest and the winners deserve the £1,000 prize. But nothing would persuade Robert and Lisa Foden, from near Warrington in Cheshire, to agree. Lisa, 34, who appeared on the show on May 20 last year, says they lost only because ‘the two people who won gave everyone else rubbish marks’. This may sound like sour grapes, but given the effort and ingenuity that went into the couple’s extraordinary Bond-themed home, filled with high-tech luxuries 007 would be proud of, their angst is understandable.","completion":"For months after the show's airing, the Foden couple could not shake the feeling of being unfairly judged by their fellow competitors. Their sleek, modern, and tech-savvy home, designed around the iconic James Bond theme, was certainly a cut above the rest. However, they couldn't shake the nagging feeling that there was more to the judging than met the eye. For weeks, the Fodens analyzed the episodes that preceded theirs and found a pattern. In each episode, a specific couple would give extremely low scores to their competitors, resulting in the couple becoming the show's victors. These findings fueled Lisa and Robert's search for the truth. They decided that the only way to clear their conscience and expose the accused couple's alleged tactics was to show their proof to the show's producers. Gathering their evidence in the form of a detailed table and chart, Lisa and Robert brought their concerns to the attention of the producers via a formal letter. In the letter, they laid out the patterns they discovered and explained that the alleged manipulative ratings were the reason their own home did not win the prize. The couple also politely requested a revision of their episode's scores to ensure a fairer outcome. Following the Fodens' revelations, the Channel 4 producers decided to investigate the matter further, comparing the scores over other episodes where the accused couple resided. Although there was hesitation in making a final decision due to the subjective nature of judging homes, the compelling evidence provided by the Fodens led to the show's producers taking swift action. To make amends for the alleged foul play, the May The Best House Win production team decided to combine the scores of the Foden's house against a different set of episodes, resulting in a more fair comparison. After a complete reassessment of the scores, the Fodens' Bond-themed home was declared the new grand winner of the show, and they were finally awarded the sought-after £1,000 prize. The Channel 4 team reached out to the Foden couple, who expressed their gratitude for the fairer outcome. The show's producers ensured that future episodes would be closely monitored to prevent manipulative scoring tactics from affecting the overall results. The couple featured in the original winning episode was barred from participating in future shows, and their victory was stripped from the record. In the weeks that followed, the story unfolded in the media, gaining widespread public attention. The show saw a surge in viewership as the audiences became curious about the result of the Fodens' tireless pursuit of fairness. Out of controversy came growth, and Channel 4 vowed to enhance their show's integrity and maintain the original lighthearted spirit of friendly competition. For the Fodens, their efforts did more than just secure victory. Their dedication to fairness transformed a potentially negative experience into a lesson in perseverance and advocating for justice in a seemingly innocent TV show. Ultimately, their actions reshaped the rules of May The Best House Win and served as an important reminder to always stand up for what is right, even when it comes to the less critical, but equally as meaningful aspects of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Barrow was born in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, traveled in a covered wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. Barrow partnered with Harry Stevens in 1894 to sell concessions at baseball games. He helped George Moreland form the Interstate League, a Class-C minor league, in 1894. Barrow, with Stevens and Al Buckenberger, purchased the Wheeling Nailers of the Interstate League in 1896. Barrow served as field manager until the collapse of the league that season. The team continued in the Iron and Oil League for the rest of the year. Barrow then bought the Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class-A Atlantic League, managing them for the rest of the 1896 season. Barrow discovered Honus Wagner throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed him to his first professional contract. Barrow sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for 2,100 the next year (61,774 in current dollar terms). With poor attendance, Barrow brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired. He also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, to pitch a few innings a game. From 1897 through 1899, Barrow served as president of the Atlantic League. During this time, in the winter of 1898-99, Barrow and Jake Wells established a movie theater in Richmond, Virginia. Barrow managed Paterson again in 1899, but the league folded after the season. With the money earned from the sale of the Richmond movie theater, Barrow purchased a one-quarter share of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class-A Eastern League in 1900 from Arthur Irwin, and served as the team's manager. Irwin, hired to be the manager of the Washington Senators of the NL, brought his most talented players with him. Rebuilding the Maple Leafs, Barrow acquired talented players, such as Nick Altrock, and the team improved from a fifth-place finish in 1899, to a third-place finish in 1900, and a second-place finish in 1901. The Maple Leafs won the league championship in 1902, even though they lost many of their most talented players, including Altrock, to the upstart American League (AL). Barrow managed in the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers of the AL in 1903, finishing fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish. With the Tigers, Barrow feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld. Tigers' owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season. Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation. He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for the rest of the season. He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906. Disheartened with baseball after finishing in last place, Barrow hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto. Did he change teams?","completion":"Yes, Ed Barrow changed teams multiple times throughout his career in baseball. In his early years, he moved from managing the Wheeling Nailers in the Interstate League to managing the Paterson Silk Weavers in the Class-A Atlantic League. After serving as the president of the Atlantic League from 1897 to 1899, he became the manager and part-owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Class-A Eastern League in 1900. Barrow then went on to manage the Detroit Tigers in the major leagues, serving as their manager in 1903 and 1904. After resigning from the Tigers, he managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for the rest of the 1904 season and then went on to manage the Indianapolis Indians in the Class-A American Association in 1905. He returned to manage the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1906 before eventually hiring Joe Kelley to take over as manager in 1907.

But the sight of the spreading oil stain reminded Nick of a childhood memory when his mom was preparing fried chicken for dinner. A similar mishap had happened, and she had soaked the shirt in vinegar and hand-washed the grease out. Although the evening recently took an expected turn, Nick felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him, grateful that he had the opportunity to revisit the past briefly. Unwilling to let the oil stain ruin his pleasant memory, Nick dashed to his room to find a clean shirt. Knowing the stain would be harder to remove the longer it lingered, he also grabbed a small bowl and filled it with vinegar. After soaking the shirt in the solution, he set it aside and changed into a fresh one. As the comforting smell of dinner wafted through the air, Nick turned his attention back to the task at hand: preparing a meal for his old friend, Justin. The two were inseparable growing up, and their lives intertwined on so many levels. They knew each other's likes and dislikes, which made cooking dishes that suited both of their tastes a breeze. This time, Nick opted for a mouthwatering Italian feast consisting of creamy mushroom fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled chicken, served with delicious garlic ciabatta, and a summer tomato-arugula salad on the side. The preparation required a bit more focus and diligence than he anticipated, noting that his pan was still sizzling from the earlier oil spill. A sigh escaped his lips as he wiped the pan clean and started over, ensuring that the oil was at the right temperature this time. However, despite the minor setback, Nick carried on, fueled by the happy memories of cooking together with his friend Justin. Recounting their youthful culinary adventures and the satisfaction of sharing a homemade meal, he focused on the warmth that the memory stirred within him. It gave him the motivation he needed to finish the dinner preparations. Meanwhile, Justin was on his way to Nick's apartment and couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. Reuniting with his oldest friend made him reflect on their journey as friends and the valuable time they spent growing side by side. Both of them had come a long way, each pursuing different careers and settling in various parts of the world. But their bond remained strong, and they always managed to pick up where they left off. Upon seeing each other, the two old friends embraced warmly—a hug filled with memories and unspoken words. They exchanged stories and caught up on each other's lives, reminiscing about the times they shared while growing up. Over the delightful Italian feast, Nick and Justin rediscovered their incredible connection, spoke about their individual accomplishments, and shared heartaches, dreams, and future plans. As the evening wound down to a close, they found comfort in the knowledge that, despite the passage of time, the bond between them remained unbroken. Despite the various turns and bends their individual lives had taken, the memory of sharing time together in the kitchen solidified the roots of their friendship.

Write a summary based on this article: Researchers have uncovered animal bones, flint tools, and evidence of burning that predates the first stones at Stonehenge by nearly 5,000 years. Here, an animal bone, with a point still in it Editor's Note: This story was updated April 24 at 10:20 a.m. ET. A site near Stonehenge has revealed archaeological evidence that hunters lived just a mile from Stonehenge roughly 5,000 years prior to the construction of the first stones, new research suggests. What's more, the site, which was occupied continuously for 3,000 years, had evidence of burning, thousands of flint tool fragments and bones of wild aurochs , a type of extinct giant cow. That suggests the area near Stonehenge may have been an auroch migration route that became an ancient feasting site, drawing people together from across different cultures in the region, wrote lead researcher David Jacques of the Open University in the United Kingdom, in an email. \\"We may have found the cradle of Stonehenge, the reason why it is where it is,\\" Jacques wrote. [In Photos: A Walk Through Stonehenge] The new discovery may also identify the people who first erected structures at Stonehenge. A few gigantic pine posts, possibly totem poles, were raised at Stonehenge between 8,500 and 10,000 years ago, but until now there was scant evidence of occupation in the area that long ago. The new research suggests those ancient structures may perhaps have been raised to honor a sacred hunting ground. Mysterious monument For decades, people have wondered at the enigmatic stone structures erected roughly 5,000 years ago in the plains of Wiltshire, England. No one knows why ancient people built the structure: some believe it was a place of ancient worship or a sun calendar, whereas still others think it was a symbol of unity or even that Stonehenge was inspired by a sound illusion. The large megaliths, known as sarsens, are up to 30 feet tall and weigh up to 25 tons, while the smaller bluestones weigh up to 4 tons. Researchers think the giant boulders came from a quarry near Marlborough Downs, just 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the iconic site, while the bluestones likely came from Preseli Hills in Wales, nearly 156 miles (250 km) away from Stonehenge. Old photographs Jacques was looking through archival photographs of the region surrounding Stonehenge when he spotted a site known as Vespasian's Camp, just a mile from Stonehenge in nearby Amesbury. Realizing that it hadn't been fully surveyed, Jacques began to investigate the area, which harbored a freshwater spring. Because animals like to stop and drink at such watering holes, Jacques wondered whether ancient man may have settled nearby as well. The team uncovered roughly 350 animal bones and 12,500 flint tools or fragments, as well as lots of evidence of burning. Carbon dating suggested the area was occupied by humans from 7500 B.C. to 4700 B.C. — roughly 5,000 years prior to the erection of the first stones at Stonehenge. [See Photos of the Stonehenge Hunting Ground ] \\"The spring may have originally attracted large animals to it, which would have aided hunting and may have led to associations that the area was a sacred hunting ground,\\" Jacques wrote. In addition, the researchers found tools made from stone from one region of England, but fashioned in the style of another region (for instance, a stone tool made from Welsh or Cornwall slate, but made in a style typical of Sussex). That suggests the people from different regions were coming together at the site, Jacques wrote. Ancient builders? The findings could help researchers pinpoint why the ancient builders of Stonehenge chose the place they did, Jacques said. \\"We have found a bridge from which transmission of cultural memory about the 'specialness' of the place where the stones were later being put up was possible,\\" Jacques wrote. \\"We are getting closer to understanding their reasons for putting it up — it is all to do with ancestors, but those ancestors go much further back than has previously been realised.\\" The findings show \\"there was a substantial interest in the Stonehenge landscape well before the stones were hauled there and erected,\\" said Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in the U.K., who was not involved in the study. Excavations dating to 2008 at Stonehenge also confirm earlier use at the megalithic site, Darvill wrote. However, what makes the Amesbury discovery special is the large trove of auroch bones found in the area, which suggests the spring was on a natural migration route for the wild aurochs, he said.

Archaeologists discovered animal bones, thousands of flint tool fragments, and evidence of burning, suggesting that the area might have been an auroch migration route and an ancient feasting site that drew people from different cultures in the region. The findings could potentially identify the people who first erected structures at Stonehenge and shed light on why the monument was built in its specific location. These discoveries reveal a connection to the Stonehenge landscape long before the iconic stones were built, fueling further theories about the ancient people's motivations for constructing the mysterious monument."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Complete the following sentence. The teachers tried to fit all the books into the schools but the","completion":"volumes were simply too numerous and space in the schools too limited. The effort was admirable, yet it appeared herculean given the sheer quantity of books that were to be integrated. The number of books was staggering, encompassing several thousands, each carrying immense educational value and potential to positively impact the students. These books were acquired from various sources including donations from non-profit organizations and individuals who wished to enrich the libraries of these institutions. Teaching aids, textbooks, fiction, non-fiction, research journals, periodicals, encyclopedias, atlases – the spectrum of book categories was diverse. They included seminal works of literature, science, history, and arts that had the potential to shape and inspire the young minds in the institutions. They possessed enormous potential to contribute not just to the academic understanding of the students but also to their overall personality development, by broadening their perspectives on varied subjects and encouraging them to think creatively and critically. The teachers, fully aware of their usefulness and the importance of these learning resources, were determined to incorporate them into the school system. They toiled tirelessly, sorting and categorizing the books, arranging them methodically in an attempt to fit them into the limited space. They even tried creative spacing solutions - making use of the walls for hanging bookshelves, attempting to crowd the library spaces more efficiently, even looking to find space under stairwells and unused corners. However, the space the schools provided was highly limited. Education facilities, especially those in busy urban environments or underserved rural areas, often suffer from space constraints. Classrooms were already packed with students, leaving little extra space for new bookshelves. Existing libraries, despite their best efforts to maximize storage solutions, struggled to accommodate the influx of these new books. Furthermore, increasing the capacity to store books in the school comes with logistical issues. The overcrowded spaces could lead to issues related to the maintenance and preservation of the books. Increasing the books to an insurmountable quantity might hamper the students' accessibility to these resources, as locating a particular book in a sea of texts would become increasingly difficult. What this situation underscores is a larger issue faced by numerous educational institutions - the desirability for more resources yet the struggle to accommodate them. The teachers' efforts become emblematic of a universal endeavor in education to provide more for students, yet the limitations of physical infrastructure can sometimes prove to be challenging. As such, the teachers’ dilemma of trying to fit all the books into the schools highlights the necessity for scaling up infrastructure, for improved storage solutions, and potentially for exploring digital alternatives, to ensure that valuable resources such as these books can be incorporated and utilized effectively in the learning process."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When a tornado hit the small town of Otwell, Indiana years ago, Kathryn Martin, 32, who lived 60 miles away in Evansville, couldn't get the news out of her mind. \\"I kept thinking, 'Those poor people. Somebody's got to help them,'\\" she says. She knew firsthand what they were going through. Six months earlier, a tornado had struck her town, taking the lives of her 2-year-old son, C.J. and her mother-in-law. \\"It was the most terrible experience of my life,\\" she says. \\"That _ will never go away, and it broke my heart to think about what these families were going through in Otwell.\\" So Kathryn loaded her car with juice boxes, snacks and toys and drove to Otwell. She gave the items to the Red Cross, and as she was leaving, she saw a couple sorting through the ruins of their home while their children were watching. So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. \\"The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,\\" she says. On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers. Finally, in August 2007, she showed C.J.'s Bus, a 35-foot school bus that was turned into a mobile playroom. In the following years, stocked with video games and DVDs, toys, crafts, books and more, the bus traveled to disaster-torn towns, giving the children there a safe place to play.

Everybody at the picnic thought breastfeeding publicly is a good idea","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that people at the outdoor luncheon in Cambridge, MA, were comfortable with and accepting of public breastfeeding. While the scenario suggests that nobody minded the public breastfeeding, there may be various opinions that individuals held but did not express. It is important to consider several factors before concluding that everyone at the event thought public breastfeeding is a good idea: 1. Cultural context: The acceptance of public breastfeeding could be linked to the cultural attitudes in the area, as Cambridge, MA, is generally recognized as a progressive and open-minded community. This context, however, does not guarantee that every individual present held the same positive perspective on public breastfeeding. 2. Individual beliefs: People often have different beliefs and values based on their upbringing, personal experiences, religious or cultural backgrounds, or education. Thus, it is possible that some individuals may have had reservations or concerns about public breastfeeding, but chose not to express their opinions in order not to offend the mother or disrupt the event. 3. Social pressure: In some cases, individuals may choose to conform to the collective opinion or behavior within a social situation due to the desire to fit in, avoid conflict, or adhere to societal norms. It could be that some people at the event did not agree with public breastfeeding, but felt uncomfortable or unwilling to speak out and draw attention to their differing opinion. 4. Tolerance vs. endorsement: It is crucial to differentiate between tolerating a behavior and actively endorsing it. While the attendees did not object to the public breastfeeding, it does not necessarily mean they all considered it a good idea. Some people may have personal reservations about the practice but were respectful of the mother's choice and did not want to interfere. Taking all these factors into account, it would be more accurate to assert that the attendees at the outdoor luncheon were respectful and tolerant of public breastfeeding, rather than making a generalization that everyone thought it was a good idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: EXETER — About 300 people jammed St. Cecelia’s Church Monday to say goodbye to their friend and loved one, Kevin McGroarty. But most of those in attendance expected McGroarty to show up. Kevin McGroarty died Tuesday and his cremated remains were interred Monday afternoon at, as he called it in his self-written obituary, his new home at Mt. Olivet Cemetery. His cousin, Bill McGroarty, offered what Kevin might have thought about the packed church at his funeral. “He would ask, ‘Don’t all these people have something better to do today?’” Bill said. Monday’s service was filled with emotion — genuine grief and sadness over losing “everybody’s best friend.” There was humor, as you would expect, but the overall tone was a group-shared sense of extreme loss. But it was McGroarty’s obituary, written by him a year ago, according to his closest friends, that jettisoned McGroarty to his 15 minutes of fame following his death. For example, McGroarty wrote: “McGroarty Achieves Room Temperature! “Kevin J. McGroarty, 53, of West Pittston, died Tuesday, July 22, 2014, after battling a long fight with mediocracy. “He enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and Marx Brothers movies.” Just a sampling of the wit and humor of McGroarty, who was a self-described “veteran of the advertising industry.” Big man, bigger heart Tim Yurek was charged with delivering the eulogy at Monday’s service. As Yurek struggled with emotion, fighting back tears, he managed to paint a clear picture of the man most in attendance knew, but many — especially those who read his obituary — wished they had known. The Rev. Paul McDonnell, a longtime friend of McGroarty’s, conducted the service and he, too, offered touching remarks about a man who literally and figuratively was larger than life. McDonnell described McGroarty as a “big man with a big heart.” “He brought so much joy into our lives,” he said. “His obituary has become the talk of the town — well, the talk of the country actually.” McDonnell said some are probably wondering if McGroarty really did die. “Could he have faked his death?” McDonnell asked. “We gathered here today know that, unfortunately, is not true.” McDonnell said McGroarty was a man of faith who flew in the face of an angry world. “Kevin reminds us of what life is truly about,” he said. “Kevin made us laugh. He wanted us to love one another. I read in the newspaper that somebody rated this area as the unhappiest. Whoever said that never met Kevin McGroarty. The best way to remember Kevin is to imitate his life. Be good to each other every day.” Yurek stepped to the podium and took a deep breath. He said his goal was to honor McGroarty’s life. “He was George Bailey from ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’” Yurek said. “He didn’t have a lot of money, but he was the richest guy in town.” Yurek said McGroarty was an adoring son and a loving brother who had impeccable penmanship. “And he was an incredible friend,” Yurek said. “Kevin was the person you called when you needed someone to talk to — a shoulder to cry on, to share successes with. He was a good listener.” A cell phone went off in church and Yurek said, “Get that, it’s probably Kevin.” Yurek said you could trust McGroarty with a secret or a million dollars. He admitted his faults and was well-aware of his blessings. But Yurek said, McGroarty was a boy from Wyoming — the town he grew up in and loved. “He cherished his roots,” Yurek said. “His passing leaves a huge hole.” In 2012, with the talk of the end of the world soon to come, Yurek said McGroarty posted this on Facebook: “No matter how it comes, it’s been a great ride. I’ve enjoyed every minute of it. Adios to those I love; you know who you are.” With that, Yurek ended his eulogy with, “Adios, Kevin.” As McGroarty’s urn was taken from the church, with his family and friends following, “When Irish Eyes Were Smiling” played in the background. Later in the day, three of his closest friends — Sam Rizzo, Dave Fusco and Jim Dellarte — fought back tears at Pat Patte’s Sports Bar and they talked about their late friend and his zest for life. “There are a lot of life lessons to be learned from the way Kevin led his life,” Rizzo, 53, said. Noting good deeds The three talked about McGroarty and his almost uncontrollable penchant for helping/rewarding those less fortunate and those who performed random acts of kindness, like the time in Las Vegas when a vagrant approached Rizzo and McGroarty and others asking for a couple of bucks. Nobody responded, except McGroarty. “He handed the guy a fifty dollar bill,” Rizzo said. “And he asked the vagrant to promise him that he would have at least a sandwich and not spend it all on booze.” Rizzo asked McGroarty why he did that and his response was, “Someday that might be me.” And then at Grotto Harveys Lake, a group came in after an afternoon of boating. They had their valuables in a bag that they set on the floor. When they were leaving, they forgot the bag and two young women grabbed it and ran after the people to return it. “Kevin asked the waitress for their bill and he paid it,” Dellarte said. ” The waitress asked who shall I say paid the bill and Kevin told her it didn’t matter; that they didn’t know each other. The waitress asked why he would pay their bill and Kevin just said that he saw them do a nice deed for someone.” Fusco said his daughter broke her ankle and was in the hospital for surgery. When Kevin found out, he would send her flowers, candy, gifts every day. “That was Kevin,” he said. “That’s where his heart was.” Earlier in the day, the three friends greeted all of the visitors at church. They were amazed at the number of people who they didn’t know, but who knew Kevin. And there were several people who only knew him from his obituary. “One man told me he never met Kevin, but he read his obituary and he wanted to come and see what he was all about.” Fusco visited McGroarty on the night before he died. It was 9:30 p.m. “He told me he didn’t receive guests after 9 p.m.,” Fusco said. “Now get out of here, he told me.” Fusco, Rizzo and Dellarte laughed — and cried. They said they already miss their friend. And, they said, they always will. ||||| Leave it to an ad guy to write his own hilariously entertaining obituary, and have it go viral in the days after his death. Kevin J. McGroarty, who died last Tuesday at age 53, had worked in advertising since 1983 and ran Rhino Media in West Pittston, Pa., until 2006, according to the obituary in the Wilkes Barre Times Leader—a 500-word mini masterpiece that gets off to a flying start with the line: \\"McGroarty achieves room temperature!\\" Every paragraph is amusing, though the high points include: • He was preceded in death by brother, Airborne Ranger Lt. Michael F. McGroarty, and many beloved pets, Chainsaw, an English Mastiff in Spring 2009, Baron, an Irish Setter in August 1982, Peter Max, a turtle, Summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances. • McGroarty leaves behind no children (that he knows of), but if he did their names would be son, \\"Almighty Thor\\" McGroarty; and daughter, \\"Butter Cup Patchouli.\\" • He would like to remind his friends: \\"Please, don't email me, I'm dead.\\" • A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in St. Cecilia Church of St. Barbara Parish, 1700 Wyoming Ave., Exeter, following a brief rant of how the government screwed up all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons trying to censor violence.

McGroarty, 53, of West Pittston, died Tuesday, July 22, 2014, after battling a long fight with mediocracy. Born 1960 in the Nesbitt Hospital, he was the bouncing baby boy of the late Lt. Col. Edward M. McGroarty and Helen Jane (Hudson) McGroarty, whom the New York Times should have noted as extraordinary parents. He was baptized at St. Cecilia Church, Exeter, which later burned to the ground, attended Butler Street Elementary, which was later torn down, and middle school at 6th Street in Wyoming, now an apartment building. He enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and Marx Brother's movies. He led a crusade to promote area midget wrestling, and in his youth was noted for his many unsanctioned daredevil stunts. He was preceded in death by brother, Airborne Ranger Lt. Michael F. McGroarty, and many beloved pets, Chainsaw, an English Mastiff in Spring 2009, Baron, an Irish Setter in August 1982, Peter Max, a turtle, Summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances. McGroarty leaves behind no children (that he knows of), but if he did their names would be son, \\"Almighty Thor\\" McGroarty; and daughter, \\"Butter Cup Patchouli.\\" McGroarty was a veteran of the advertising industry since 1983. McGroarty was a pioneer in Apple computing, purchasing one of the first in the Wyoming Valley in 1985. He would like to remind his friends: \\"Please, don't email me, I'm dead.\\" McGroarty was a founding partner of Pyramid Advertising, and finally principal owner of award-winning Rhino Media until 2006. He was also an adjunct instructor at Luzerne County Community College, from 2005-2009. He will be laid to rest at Mount Olivet Cemetery, section 7N. He asks to please make note of his new address. McGroarty's headstone reads: \\"I'll Be Right Back,\\" one of his favorite sayings. He leaves this world with few regrets, one being told in grade school, his adult life would see the Hershey candy bar rise in cost to over a dollar. He maintained given the resources and initiative, he would rally the good citizens of the Commonwealth to a revolution that would force that price to its original 35-cent market value, a dream he was not able to fulfill, by his own admission the reason: \\"I was distracted by many beautiful women.\\" In lieu of flowers, friends are asked to please give generously to the Pennsylvania State Police Troop \\"P\\" Camp Cadet Fund. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in St. Cecilia Church of St. Barbara Parish, 1700 Wyoming Ave., Exeter, following a brief rant of how the government screwed up all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons trying to censor violence. This will be presented by his attorney, Bret Zankel, Esq. Friends may call from 9 to 10 a.m. Monday in the church. McGroarty leaves behind a thought for all to ponder, given years of gathering wisdom from different religions and deep study of the Greek philosophers: \\"It costs nothing to be nice\\" and \\"Never stick a steak knife in an electrical outlet.\\" Arrangements by the Metcalfe-Shaver-Kopcza Funeral Home Inc., 504 Wyoming Ave., Wyoming. |||||Summary:","completion":"Kevin McGroarty's funeral took place at St. Cecelia's Church, where 300 people came to say their goodbyes.

The Reverend Paul McDonnell, a longtime friend, described Kevin as a \\"big man with a big heart\\" who brought joy into people's lives and reminded everyone to love one another.

How to decorate for a wine tasting party Pick a theme to create cohesiveness. To make your planning and decorating easier, try picking a particular theme. For instance, you could pick a particular region, such as wines of southern france or even wines local to your area. Choose from: A). Doing so will build the cohesiveness that it will require from the location. For instance, for a wine tasting where everyone in attendance will be drinking, you could choose to use the word \\" france \\" in place of \\" palate \\" in the name of your wine. B). Often, you won't have much to choose from but there are well-made, easy-to-find ideas. Try house parties for your cohesion. C). Alternatively, you could focus on one type of wine, such as all merlot or chardonnay. Another option is picking wines that pair perfectly with a certain food (such as chocolate or cheese). D). Make sure that the theme that brings out a wine tasting is unique. If you're in a more temperate climate, a full-blown wine party might be more fun.","completion":"C). Alternatively, you could focus on one type of wine, such as all merlot or chardonnay. Another option is picking wines that pair perfectly with a certain food (such as chocolate or cheese). Step 1: Decide the specific focus of the wine tasting Since a theme has been suggested to create cohesiveness, focusing on one type of wine or wine-food pairings will help narrow down the selections while keeping guests engaged in the unique offerings. Step 2: Research appropriate decorations and table settings Based on the chosen focus, research suitable decorations, such as tablecloths, napkins, plates, and glassware that match the theme. For example, if focusing on wine and cheese pairings, invest in attractive cheese boards and proper utensils. Step 3: Set up the tasting stations Arrange the wine selections and appropriate food pairings in an attractive and organized manner, ensuring that there is adequate space for all guests to comfortably taste and discuss the offerings. Step 4: Provide information on the wines Since many guests may be unfamiliar with the wines or their ideal pairings, prepare and display descriptions for each wine, including the region, variety, flavor profile, and any relevant pairing suggestions. Step 5: Enhance the atmosphere with music and lighting In addition to the decorations and theme, creating an inviting atmosphere is essential for a successful wine tasting party. Select music that aligns with the mood, such as soft jazz or classical, and adjust the lighting to create a cozy ambiance. Step 6: Encourage guests to discuss their tasting experiences As the party progresses, provide opportunities for guests to share their thoughts and impressions on the wines and pairings, creating an engaging and interactive experience for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If Thus, there is a business incentive for any postal provider (who is not simply a cream skimmer) to offer universal service within the territories it serves., can we conclude that \\"Postal providers do not desire to provide service to everyone in their territories. \\"?","completion":"Based on the given statement, we cannot conclude that \\"Postal providers do not desire to provide service to everyone in their territories\\". In fact, the statement suggests the opposite. It implies that postal providers do have a business incentive to offer universal service within the territories they serve, which means they are inclined to provide services to everyone within those territories. The statement argues against the idea of \\"cream skimming,\\" a concept where service providers choose to serve only the most profitable parts of a market while neglecting the less profitable areas. In the context of postal services, cream skimming would mean not serving remote or rural areas where the costs of service are higher. However, the statement provided implies that there is a business advantage to provide universal service to everyone in the territories, despite the different costs associated with each area. Postal providers who do not engage in cream-skimming are more likely to offer such universal service. The reasons for postal providers to offer universal service could be diverse, such as: 1. Maintaining market share and customer loyalty: By servicing the entire territory, postal providers can hold a competitive advantage over those who don't. Further, if a postal provider offers services to the entire population, they are more likely to have loyal customers who consistently utilize their services. 2. Regulatory and/or government requirements: In some jurisdictions, postal service providers may be required by law to provide services to everyone in the territory (often with a Universal Service Obligation). This ensures that essential postal services are available to all citizens, regardless of their location or income. 3. Economies of scale: By offering universal service, postal providers can take advantage of economies of scale, which means they can decrease their average cost per unit through increased production. With a broader service area, they can achieve better efficiency in their operations and ultimately offer more competitive pricing. 4. Reputation and branding: Providing services to everyone in the territory can help postal providers establish a strong reputation and brand image. This can lead to additional business through word-of-mouth marketing, as well as a general perception of quality and reliability. 5. Long-term profitability: While serving remote or less profitable areas may yield lower profit margins, maintaining a presence in those regions could result in future economic growth. As these areas grow, the overall profitability of providing postal services to them could increase. In conclusion, we cannot derive from the given statement that postal providers do not desire to provide service to everyone in their territories. On the contrary, the statement highlights the business incentive for postal providers to offer universal service within the territories they serve. This, in turn, suggests that they are interested in serving the entire population within their area of operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000, and won in 2004. California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested 100 million into the company in 2003. Also in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\" Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\". On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union. In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped. In November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King, featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements. In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand's GIRLS collection.

Realizing her mistake, Lindsey immediately feels guilty about the situation as she knows how much Kayla's purse means to her. As a gesture of goodwill and taking responsibility for the mishap, Lindsey apologizes to Kayla for causing the stain on her purse. She admits that it was her carelessness that led to the ink stains and assures Kayla that she will do her best to clean it. Wanting to show genuine remorse, Lindsey searches for solutions to remove ink stains from Kayla's purse effectively. She spends time researching different methods to clean the specific type of material the purse is made of, whether it is leather, fabric, or a synthetic material. After gathering the required information, Lindsey prepares the necessary cleaning solution. For instance, if the purse is made of leather, Lindsey might use a combination of rubbing alcohol or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, a cotton swab, and a clean cloth to remove the stains. If the purse is made of fabric, she might use a mix of water, white vinegar, and dish soap to clean the stains. In case the purse is made of synthetic material, Lindsey could use a non-acetone nail polish remover to clean the affected area. Lindsey initiates the cleaning process by first testing the cleaning solution on a hidden area of the purse to ensure it won't damage the material further. Once confident that the cleaning solution is suitable, she treats the ink-stained area with great care, using moderate pressure to avoid damaging it. As Lindsey works on removing the stain, she continuously communicates with Kayla, keeping her updated about the progress and seeking her opinion on the outcome. Throughout the cleaning process, Lindsey remains genuinely apologetic and takes full responsibility for the incident, ensuring that Kayla feels heard and understood. She is also open to alternative suggestions offered by Kayla during the process, as her ultimate goal is to fix her mistake and mend their friendship while addressing the issue with Kayla's purse.

By apologizing, taking responsibility, and actively attempting to clean the stain, Lindsey ensures that she maintains her friendship with Kayla and grows from the experience through understanding the importance of careful handling of other people's belongings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here, I will analyze the review comprehensively to determine whether it would decrease or increase the chances of purchasing the product. The review title, \\"Beware!\\" immediately serves as a warning to potential buyers. It suggests that there may be a problem with the product that the reviewer feels others should know about before deciding to purchase it. Therefore, initially, the title would contribute to a decrease in the likelihood of buying the product. Moving on to the product review itself, it focuses on a specific issue: the DVD edition of a movie being pitched almost a 4th above of the original opera pitch. For those who value the authentic experience and original opera pitch, this presents a valid concern that could negatively affect their viewing experience. This issue could be particularly significant for those who have perfect pitch or are well-versed in the opera world. As a result, the presence of this problem would decrease the chances of buying the product for such individuals. However, it is essential to consider the target audience and personal preferences in this scenario. For those who do not possess perfect pitch or might not be bothered by the difference in pitch, this issue might not influence their decision as heavily. The reviewer does mention that \\"even for listeners with no perfect pitch, the experience of G. Reich voice sounding like a tenor would be a frustrating one,\\" but it is essential to recognize that this opinion may not apply to everyone. Additionally, the review does not touch upon other aspects of the DVD edition, such as video quality, additional features, or overall production value. For some individuals, these factors might carry more weight in their decision-making process. If these other aspects receive positive reviews or are known to be of high quality, it could serve to increase the chances of purchasing the product despite the mentioned issue. In conclusion, the given review would predominantly decrease the chances of buying the product due to the highlighted pitch problem that could potentially affect the overall experience, especially for those who value the original opera pitch or have perfect pitch. However, the impact of this review on the purchasing decision may vary based on personal preferences, the importance of the mentioned issue, and other factors related to the DVD edition's quality and features not covered in the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan and Barrie's own novelization of it, Peter and Wendy. The music is mostly by Mark \\"Moose\\" Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne, and most of the lyrics were written by Carolyn Leigh, with additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The original 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook, earned Tony Awards for both stars. It was followed by NBC telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. The Jolly Roger Hook revels in his success (\\"Hook's Waltz\\"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the \\"doodle-doo\\" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises (\\"I've Gotta Crow\\" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow (\\"I Gotta Crow\\" [2nd reprise]). Back home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother (\\"Tender Shepherd\\" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys (\\"We Will Grow Up\\"). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her. Years pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, \\"Boy, why are you crying?\\" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, \\"Oh, if only I could go with you!\\" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, \\"You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up\\". And so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, \\"just for Spring cleaning.\\" Her daughter and the \\"boy who wouldn't grow up\\" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window.

Elena never seemed to care about others' feelings, only focusing on what she wanted at the moment. Step 1: Understand the story so far - The story talks about Elena and Tanya with regard to a cake. - It specifically points out that Elena always took more cake than Tanya. - Elena's greediness is highlighted in the story. Step 2: Develop the story further - Introduce how Elena's greediness affects her relationship with Tanya. - Bring in other characters and situations to show the consequences of Elena's greediness. - Try to create a situation where Elena might learn a lesson or realize the consequences of her actions. Continuing the story: Tanya, on the other hand, was much more considerate and tried to make sure everyone got a fair share. This led to many disputes between the two friends whenever dessert was involved. Tanya often found herself wondering why Elena was so incredibly selfish when it came to treats. One day, during a birthday party, Elena's greediness reached a boiling point. The birthday boy, Tim, was about to cut the cake when Elena pushed her way to the front and grabbed the biggest slice for herself. The shocked and disappointed expressions on the faces of Tim and the other guests were unmistakable. But Elena, as usual, was rather oblivious to the effect her actions had on others. Tanya had enough. She pulled Elena aside and confronted her about her behavior. Elena, feeling attacked, tried to brush it off, but Tanya remained firm. She explained that if Elena continued to act this way, people would not want to spend time with her, and she risked losing friends, including Tanya herself. For the first time, Elena began to see the consequences of her greedy behavior. It wasn't just about getting a bigger piece of cake; it was about respect, empathy, and the long-term effects her actions had on friendships. As a result, Elena made a conscious effort to change and become a more considerate person, not just for Tanya, but for all the people in her life. The road to change was not easy, but with Tanya's support and the lessons she had learned, Elena was determined to be a better friend and person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for salt made for horses at your local pet store or feed store and buy it in bulk. Check that the salt is not a mineral salt blend, such as red salt, or salt that is meant for de-icing roads.","completion":"When you have the appropriate salt, decide on the type of salt lick you would like to create, whether it be a block, loose salt, or a hanging option, and gather necessary materials to construct the salt lick. If you've chosen to make a block, you can use a mold or create one by cutting the top off of a milk carton or similar container and rinsing it thoroughly. Mix the salt with a small amount of water, just enough to form a slushy consistency, and pour this mixture into the mold. Allow the mixture to set for several hours, or until it hardens completely, and then carefully remove the hardened salt lick from its mold. If you prefer a loose salt option, place the salt in a shallow, weather-proof container, such as a plastic tray or bowl, and position it securely in your horse's paddock or stall to prevent it from being knocked over. Alternatively, for a hanging salt lick, drill a hole through the center of a hardened salt block and thread a sturdy rope or chain through the hole. Secure the salt lick to a fence or post within reach of your horse, making sure it is hanging at an appropriate height for easy access. Regularly check and replenish the salt lick, ensuring that it remains clean and free from contaminants, in order to provide your horse with essential nutrients and promote healthy digestion, hydration, and overall wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster.

No; \\"Happy afterwards\\" would not be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Bailey feel afterwards?\\" when considering the situation in which Bailey eventually realizes that he had forgotten her birthday. It is unlikely that Bailey would feel happy upon realizing that he forgot something as significant as a loved one's birthday. In general, when people forget important events or milestones for someone they care for, it often leads to negative emotions such as guilt, remorse, or embarrassment. Forgetting a birthday might make Bailey feel guilty for not remembering an important day and potentially disappointing or hurting the other person. It could also trigger embarrassment as others might view it as a sign of negligence or lack of attentiveness. Furthermore, Bailey might feel the need to make it up to the person whose birthday was forgotten, which could involve apologizing, explaining the situation, and trying to find a way to celebrate the missed occasion. This desire to mend the relationship and make amends could result in feelings of stress or anxiety if Bailey struggles to come up with an appropriate way to rectify the situation. Thus, given the emotional implications of forgetting someone's birthday, \\"happy afterwards\\" would not be a sensible answer to the question of how Bailey would feel in this scenario.

In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.

Answer:","completion":"To answer the question of who has performed in more bands, Paul Rodgers or Rob Beckley, we must first explore each musician's history of their respective bands and musical associations. Paul Rodgers is a renowned English singer, songwriter, and musician. He has made a substantial contribution to the world of music through his powerful voice and songwriting prowess. His career took off during the late 1960s and he has remained active in the music scene ever since. Here is a breakdown of the prominent bands and projects Paul Rodgers has been a part of: 1. Free (1968-1973) - Forming the band Free allowed Rodgers to gain fame as a rock vocalist. Known for the hit song \\"All Right Now,\\" Free remained active until its disbandment in 1973. 2. Bad Company (1973-1982, 1998-2002, 2008-2010) – After Free's breakup, Rodgers formed Bad Company with Mott the Hoople's guitarist, Mick Ralphs. With major hits like \\"Feel Like Making Love\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough,\\" Bad Company enjoyed tremendous success and influence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Rodgers left the band in 1982 but later re-formed and played with them again between 1998-2002 and 2008-2010. 3. The Firm (1984-1986) – Rodgers teamed up with Led Zeppelin’s guitarist, Jimmy Page, to form The Firm, which lasted for two years and produced two albums. 4. The Law (1991-1992) – A collaboration with ex-Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones led to the formation of this brief rock duo who released just one album. 5. Rodgers recently embarked on a solo career and released several solo albums from the 1980s onwards. 6. Queen + Paul Rodgers (2004-2009) – In 2004, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen invited Rodgers to be the band's frontman. This collaboration resulted in the project “Queen + Paul Rodgers”. The trio released an album, \\"The Cosmos Rocks,\\" and performed on a global tour. Rob Beckley, on the other hand, is an American singer and guitarist known for his work in the Christian rock genre. His bands and projects include: 1. Pillar (1998-present) - Beckley is the lead vocalist and founding member of this Christian rock band formed in 1998. Pillar has released multiple albums to date, garnering positive reception in the Christian rock scene. 2. Beckley has also contributed to some side projects and collaborations within the Christian music community. If we compare the two musicians, it becomes evident that Paul Rodgers has performed in more bands than Rob Beckley. Paul Rodgers has been associated with at least six diverse musical projects, including Free, Bad Company, The Firm, The Law, his solo career, and Queen + Paul Rodgers. In contrast, Rob Beckley has mainly performed with Pillar alongside a few side projects. Therefore, Paul Rodgers has been a part of more bands and associations throughout his musical career compared to Rob Beckley."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Identify the relevant part of the premise Since we are trying to analyze if the person has a jaw or not, the important part of the premise to focus on is \\"squarely built to match his jaw.\\" Step 3: Analyze the phrase The phrase \\"squarely built to match his jaw\\" indicates that the person's build is proportional to or resembles their jaw. This means that the person must have a jaw for the comparison to be made in the first place.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Michael Jackson's personal artist shared pop king's vision By Edna Gundersen, USA TODAY SANTA FE  Artist David Nordahl was at home painting in February 1988 when the phone rang at midnight. A voice said, \\"This is Yeah, riiiight, he thought. But he quickly realized the call was no prank. While visiting Steven Spielberg's office, Jackson had admired one of Nordahl's paintings of Army troops invading an Apache camp as a young corporal shielded two Indian children. Now the singer was reaching out to the painter. For art lessons. \\"He asked if I taught drawing and painting,\\" says Nordahl, whose realist oils of 19th-century Apaches are highly prized. \\"I told him I didn't, but that I'd think about it. I was really busy.\\" Their hour-long conversation sparked a close friendship and working partnership that led Nordahl to abandon renown in the art world for a cloistered vocation as Jackson's portraitist. From 1988 to 2005, Nordahl completed thousands of drawings and roughly a dozen epic commissions, seven of which were among 2,000 Jackson items in Julien's authorized auction, which the singer sued to stop last spring. Many canvases encapsulate Jackson's grandiose fantasies and fairy-tale worldview. In a massive triptych, he is crowned and knighted in royal robes. Along the sunlit path in Field of Dreams, he leads children of all nationalities (plus sister Janet, AIDS activist Ryan White and actor Macaulay Culkin). His firstborn son snoozes on an oversized golden throne in Prince, The Boy King. Nordahl, 68, became not only Jackson's favorite living artist (Michelangelo led the historic ranking) but a trusted adviser and confidant who designed Neverland carnival rides and joined family outings. He ducked the media for years, \\"because they wanted to talk about negative stuff, and I don't know anything bad about Michael,\\" the soft-spoken Nordahl says, sitting with artist/wife Lori Peterson and frisky cat Scooter in a living room crowded with paintings by the couple. He's speaking now in hopes of brightening a picture darkened since Jackson's death June 25. \\"I always thought of him as normal,\\" he says. \\"He's the most thoughtful, respectful person I've ever met. In 20 years, I never heard him raise his voice.\\" Nordahl's Jackson period began after the singer invited him to the Denver stop of the Bad tour in March 1988. \\"I didn't know what to expect,\\" Nordahl says. \\"He was sweet. We went to galleries, bookstores and a private showing of the King Tut exhibit. We sat around and laughed and talked and drew.\\" Jackson demonstrated talent but was stretched too thin to pursue visual arts. Instead, the two began hatching ideas for Nordahl to paint. The artist conceived the inaugural work, Playmates for a Lonely Child, a 41-inch-square oil of Jackson in a sylvan storybook scene. Next Nordahl embarked on a far bolder statement, Field of Dreams, a 36-by-104-inch oil study for an unfinished work that would have measured 12 by 38 feet. He labored non-stop: large portraits, mythical tableaux, 10-foot charcoal drawings, a plaque on the Neverland gate. Nordahl billed Jackson in line with his earlier gallery rates, up to 150,000 for large pieces, and says he was always paid. His duties expanded to amusement park design after Jackson began developing the ranch north of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Nordahl juggled several projects while adapting to Jackson's enchanted lifestyle. At Neverland, the two tested rides and tended the exotic menagerie. They took trips to Disneyland and spent time at billionaire Ron Burkle's La Jolla, Calif., estate, where Jackson's insomnia often meant Nordahl was enlisted for wee-hour practical jokes and beachside chats. (He also was a victim of Jackson's notorious tricks, once finding his briefcase stuffed with bubblegum.) He discovered the unglamorous Jackson, who in the late '80s often drove by himself in a Chevy Blazer (and relieved himself in a bucket because he couldn't risk being mobbed at gas stations) and lived in a two-bedroom Los Angeles condo. \\"I expected a penthouse with maids,\\" Nordahl says. \\"There was a grand piano pushed into the kitchen, a popcorn machine and a good sound system. The other furniture, you couldn't have gotten 50 bucks for it at a garage sale. Before the kids, Michael lived real simply.\\" \\"I grew up in a difficult home, and he did too,\\" says Nordahl, whom Jackson thanks in liner notes for 1991's Dangerous and 1995's HIStory. \\"We had no playtime growing up. We're both fanatical about work. Born in Albert Lea, Minn., Nordahl left home at 12 and supported himself through high school by working on farms, pinstriping cars and selling his art. \\"I can't remember not drawing,\\" he says. \\"I had an abusive, alcoholic father, and drawing is something that takes you out of the real world. I was always interested in cowboys and Indians. I sold drawings of the Lone Ranger to my classmates.\\" He began specializing in Apaches after moving to Steamboat Springs, Colo., in 1977, and his detailed, meticulously researched depictions soon lured collectors. \\"His work had a lot of integrity, and he was one of those rare artists who was humble but extremely talented,\\" says prominent Santa Fe art dealer Ray Dewey, who held lotteries to determine buyers of Nordahl's work because of high demand. \\"His technique took a long time, so he was not prolific. When he talked to me about leaving to paint for Michael Jackson, I had over 200 people on a waiting list for his work. It was an interesting decision on his part. \\"I think what Jackson saw in David was a complete artist,\\" Dewey says. \\"He was a perfectionist. He choreographed everything. Jackson also may have seen his commitment to family. David primarily painted the Apache people's culture and lifeways, but he painted a lot of children, not just warriors. And he painted animals beautifully, especially horses.\\" What Nordahl saw in Jackson was a wounded and misunderstood genius who felt spiritually obligated to help children. Though Jackson was acquitted in his 2005 child sexual abuse trial, it \\"broke his spirit,\\" Nordahl says. \\"Michael would never molest a child. He always felt so bad for kids who were mistreated or sick. He spent so much time with critically ill kids. If a mother called about a dying child somewhere, he'd jump on a plane. \\"People talked about Neverland being his private amusement park. It was always meant for kids. The last time I was at the ranch, they put up a big Sony JumboTron across from a condo building for sick children, so if kids woke up at night, cartoons would be on.\\" 'Michael was a real dad' Nordahl was bewildered that Jackson seemed to elicit more mockery than sympathy. \\"People accused him of trying to be white, which is ridiculous,\\" he says. \\"When I first met him, his vitiligo (a skin disorder that causes pigmentation loss) had gone to the right side of his face and down his neck. Most of his right hand was white. Stark white patches. He used makeup because he had to. Without it, he was speckled all over.\\" Nordahl never witnessed drug use by Jackson but was keenly aware of pain problems that lingered after the star's hair caught fire on a Pepsi ad soundstage. \\"When they were trying to repair that burned spot, he had a balloon under his scalp that was inflated,\\" Nordahl says. \\"He let me feel it. It was a huge mound. As the skin got stretched, they cut it out and stitched the scalp. He was in excruciating pain.\\" Jackson seemed an unlikely addict, Nordahl says, noting his avoidance of cigarettes, alcohol, soft drinks and sugar. \\"He was mostly a vegetarian,\\" he says. \\"When he was on tour, the cooks would make him eat fish and sometimes chicken. He loved little chicken wings. He always drank water. I shared wine with him only twice, once with (ex-wife) Lisa Marie (Presley) and once at Ron Burkle's house. Michael had one glass.\\" The clearest evidence of Jackson's responsible nature emerged in his parenting of Prince, Paris and Blanket. \\"Michael was a real dad, not a Hollywood dad,\\" he says. \\"He'd get up at night to feed them bottles. He'd change them, bathe them, everything a mother does. \\"All the time I spent with those kids, I never heard them beg for anything or throw a fit. I never heard them cry. They were so well-adjusted.\\" Jackson took pains not to spoil his children, says Nordahl, recalling a modest eighth birthday party in L.A. for Prince. (Jackson's mother, Katherine, and sister Rebbie came over but skipped the festivities because of their Jehovah's Witness beliefs, he says.) \\"I was curious to see what Prince was going to get,\\" Nordahl says. \\"I figured it would be pretty extravagant, but he didn't get one thing that cost over 2. He got Play-Doh, little action figures, things we'd call stocking stuffers. \\"The kids were not allowed to watch TV or DVDs or play video games\\" except through points earned by their schoolwork. \\"Nothing was given to them. Michael said, 'I want them to grow up as close to normal as possible.' Those kids were so respectful and courteous, just sweet.\\" Surprise visit to Santa Fe Nordahl grew close to all three. Typically, the artist spent time with the Jackson brood on the West Coast. But over Memorial Day weekend in 2004, the star and his tykes surprised Nordahl by visiting Santa Fe via Jackson's plush private bus (with a 60-inch plasma TV). Jackson suggested a movie outing. \\"I thought we were going to a screening room,\\" Nordahl says. \\"His driver pulled into DeVargas Mall. He was friends with (Roland Emmerich), the director of The Day After Tomorrow, and it was opening weekend. The mall was jammed, and there was no place to park. I took the kids, got the tickets and popcorn, and we went in. Michael came in after the lights went down. \\"The lights came up, and nobody noticed him. He had on a baseball cap and these Chinese silk pajamas. The kids had no masks on. Any of those rags would have paid 100,000 for that picture.\\" He last saw Jackson in 2005, when the singer moved to Bahrain and vowed never again to live on U.S. soil. Accustomed to lulls when Jackson was overseas or overextended, Nordahl resumed painting Apaches and presumed he'd be summoned once Jackson found a new home and showcase for his treasures. The fate of Nordahl's Jackson paintings is in limbo, though they may be part of a touring exhibition of the singer's memorabilia proposed by the estate administrators. \\"I would like to see them in a Michael Jackson museum,\\" Nordahl says. \\"That was always Michael's goal. He was very self-effacing, but he understood he was a music icon.\\" Nordahl, represented by Settlers West Galleries in Tucson and Sherwoods Spirit of America in Santa Fe, has returned to painting Apaches and other subjects. Whether his extended hiatus from the public eye damaged his authority or reputation \\"is difficult to gauge,\\" Dewey says. \\"I don't know if it furthered his career. An artist who does commissions for one patron often is just isolated unless the patron publishes or exhibits the work. David's always been independent, and he's never sought publicity.\\" And how many patrons are the King of Pop? \\"We got to be such good friends that I forgot who I was hanging out with,\\" Nordahl says. \\"Then he'd break into these dance moves, quick as lightning, and it would dawn on me: He's the best entertainer in the world.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car, and after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel. While at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, Captain Spaulding, decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas and he assaults a woman before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis sexually assaults Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand. Otis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but he bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel, but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van. The motel maid comes to clean the room, and discovers the murder scene.

To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? Answer:","completion":"The particles of reactants in test A would have higher energy than the particles in test B. This is because, in test A, John warmed up the reactants, which means he increased their temperature. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in the average kinetic energy of the particles, as they gain energy and move more quickly. Consequently, the particles collide more frequently and with higher impact, thus increasing the rate of the chemical reaction. In contrast, in test B, John cooled down the reactants, causing their temperature to decrease. Lowering the temperature results in a decrease in the average kinetic energy of the particles, as they lose energy and move more slowly. As a result, the particles collide less frequently and with less force, causing the chemical reaction rate to slow down. The practical examples from tests C and D further support this concept, as the food item kept in the refrigerator (test C) would have a slower rate of decomposition – a chemical reaction – than the food item left on the table top (test D). This is because the lower temperature inside the refrigerator slows down the decomposition processes, while the higher temperature at room conditions speeds up the reaction rate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

I picked this up in the 'Danger After Dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) develops through the movie as a person. The acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards. On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I've seen him in is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. So, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised by him. But don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. That Hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. It's a really moving picture at some points, the photography is really well done. It's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at Blockbuster.

Not wanting this vision to come true, Papa Smurf disallows Clumsy to pick Smurf Roots. Clumsy disobeys Papa and ends up unintentionally leading Gargamel and Azrael to the village. The Smurfs all flee for their lives while Clumsy unknowingly runs towards the Forbidden Falls, with Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Grouchy, Brainy and Gutsy running after him. They find him at the edge of a cliff, and while trying to help him up, they are sucked into a gigantic vortex that spirits them to present day New York City. To make matters worse, Gargamel and Azrael follow and the Smurfs end up in the apartment of Patrick and Grace Winslow, a married and expectant couple and their Basset Hound Elway. After clarifying things, the Winslows befriend them and allow them to stay in their apartment. The next day, needing to find a \\"star gazer\\" (a telescope), the Smurfs follow Patrick to his work place at Anjelou Cosmetics, misunderstanding the previous explanation of his job as fortune-telling.

To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B? Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. A:","completion":"In case A, the objects would be closer to each other. This is because case A involves charging by conduction, which requires the objects to be in direct contact with each other for electrons to migrate and even out the charge. On the other hand, case B involves charging by induction, where charge transfer occurs without the objects physically touching each other; they are only brought near each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Надпечатка Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The term \\"Надпечатка\\" in Russian can be translated to \\"Overprint\\" in English. Overprint refers to the process of printing additional layers of ink or toner onto a substrate that has already been printed, such as paper or any other material. This technique is widely used in the printing industry for various purposes, including the creation of special effects, enhanced security features, and the correction of errors. Below are some examples of how overprinting is used: 1. Security Features: Overprint can be used to add unique holographic images, watermarks, or microtext patterns to important documents such as banknotes, passports, or certificates. These added security features make it difficult for counterfeiters to produce forgeries. 2. Error Correction: If there is a mistake on a printed material that has already been printed, an overprint can be applied to correct the error without having to reprint the entire batch. This can save significant time and money for the printer. 3. Visual Effects: Overprinting different colors of ink can create unique visual effects that enhance the aesthetics of the printed material. For instance, when two transparent inks are overprinted, the overlaps may produce a third color. This is often used in the creation of high-quality artworks and posters. 4. Postage Stamps: Overprints are commonly used to update or modify postage stamps. For example, when a country changes its currency or when there's a temporary shortage of a particular stamp denomination, overprints may be applied to existing stamps to denote the new value or to mark them as valid for use. 5. Promotional Materials: Overprints can be used on promotional materials such as brochures, flyers, or business cards. By adding a special promotion, limited-time offer, or event information, these materials can be updated or customized without having to redesign and reprint the entire piece.

Given the question \\"Why did Kai do this?\\", is \\"did this to be rude\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"did this to be rude\\" cannot be considered a valid answer in this context. Kai's intention behind buying Remy ice cream was to cheer him up, which reflects an empathetic and caring attitude. Therefore, it is clear that Kai's motivation was not to be rude, but rather to offer comfort and support. Instead, a more appropriate response could be, \\"Kai did this to lift Remy's spirits and make him feel better.\\" This answer accurately captures Kai's motive and highlights the positive intentions behind his action. Kai's decision to buy ice cream for Remy is rooted in their relationship and an understanding of Remy's emotions. It is common for people to offer comfort or attempt to cheer others up by providing them with something they enjoy, in this case, ice cream. Such gestures are aimed at making the receiver feel cared for and valued, which is quite the opposite of being rude or inconsiderate. In conclusion, \\"did this to be rude\\" is not a valid answer because it contradicts the purpose of Kai's action. His intention was to bring happiness to Remy, not to offend or annoy him.

He suspected three persons, for only these had approached the fire after the note was hidden. He had kept his eye on it, he thought, till the stir of breaking up. In that moment it must have been removed by the major, Frank Annon, or my lady; Sir Jasper was out of the question, for he never touched an ornament in the drawing room since he had awkwardly demolished a whole _étagère_ of costly trifles, to his mother's and sister's great grief. The major evidently suspected something, Annon was jealous, and my lady would be glad of a pretext to remove her daughter from his reach. Trusting to his skill in reading faces, he waited impatiently for morning, resolving to say nothing to anyone but Mrs. Snowdon, and from her merely to inquire what the note contained. Treherne usually was invisible till lunch, often till dinner; therefore, fearing to excite suspicion by unwonted activity, he did not appear till noon. The mailbag had just been opened, and everyone was busy over their letters, but all looked up to exchange a word with the newcomer, and Octavia impulsively turned to meet him, then checked herself and hid her suddenly crimsoned face behind a newspaper.

Vinyl record revival spins success for Czech producer GZ Media employee Petra Kottova checks the sound quality of a pressed vinyl record at the company's factory in Lodenice. Photograph: Petr Josek/Reuters When vinyl record sales hit bottom in the late 1980s, managers at Czech record producer GZ Media in a small town near Prague were wondering what to do with their idle record pressing machines. They decided not to get rid of them and put them in garages at the company's backyard. That proved to be a wise decision. As vinyl retro-mania started spreading around the world a decade later the firm dusted off the presses, and it is now spinning profits on records for the likes of the Rolling Stones, U2, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. With 7m records made in 2012 and 10m expected to be produced this year, GZ Media says it is the world's biggest vinyl record producer, making records for Universal Music Group and Sony Music, and is beginning to co-operate with Warner Music. \\"Vinyl is an inscrutable animal,\\" Jiri Hasek, the company's commercial director told Reuters. \\"Everybody is waiting for when the growth will slow, but instead it keeps accelerating.\\" Vinyl record production accounts for about 30% of GZ Media's sales, which reached 1.8bn crowns (93m) last year. The company also makes sophisticated packaging for expensive consumer goods such as mobile phones, electronics and whisky. Founded in 1948 as Gramofonove Zavody Lodenice, the central record producer in the then-communist bloc, GZ Media pressed its first record in 1951. During the 1980s demand for vinyl records began to ebb as CDs and DVDs emerged. Production bottomed out in the early 1990s when GZ Media was producing only about 200,000 records a year. In 1989 the communist regime collapsed and GZ Media was up for grabs as part of a nationwide privatisation programme. It ended up in the hands of US fund Winslow Partners, which later sold it to the firm's own management. Last Christmas it made a special Beatles recording gift box approved by Paul McCartney and is now working on a special gift packaging of The Who discography.

The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia. Two years after, when Allan finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy. It was now Mia's turn to make a choice. She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family.

Article: Following the news that Rolling Stone will not punish any writers or editors over its debunked campus rape story, the general reaction from fellow journalists has been a mix of bafflement and indignation. CNN’s resident media reporter Brian Stelter shared in that reaction, but also posed an interesting question for perspective: How does NBC News anchor Brian Williams feel about this news? The newsman is currently serving a six-month suspension for a (possibly career-ending) string of public embellishments about his own field reporting. When asked on this morning’s New Day why publisher Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone brass would avoid punishing anyone when so much is on the line, Stelter suggested the move has a lot to do with “loyalty” and “second chances.” “The writer of the article [Sabrina Erdely] is going to be invited back to Rolling Stone to write more in the future,” he noted. “I do wonder how Brian Williams feels reading about this.” Rolling Stone chief Wenner referred to the source of the rape allegations as an “expert fabulist,” essentially shifting the blame off his own writers, editors, and fact-checkers. In NBC’s case, however, Williams was not defended in any such manner — instead being labeled a “fabulist” himself by the media. Also interesting to note: Rolling Stone has fired writers in the past for much lesser offenses than this one. Stelter concluded today’s recap: “It makes all journalists look bad when there’s a terrible journalistic sin like this one. It hurts the whole profession. And it’s kind of baffling we’re not seeing any disciplinary actions taken.” Watch below, via CNN: Please enable Javascript to watch. [h/t Grabien] [Image via CNN/screengrab] — — ||||| LOOK AT YOURSELF The Columbia Journalism School ripped apart the UVa rape story—but the magazine’s chief blames a fabulist, not his own editors who got played. They don’t get it; they just don’t get it. In the Columbia University Journalism School’s 13,000-word postmortem, filled with incriminating details about Rolling Stone’s now-retracted campus rape investigation, the most incriminating detail is that nobody at the magazine seems to believe that its reporting, editorial, and fact-checking practices are in need of serious reform. “Rolling Stone’s senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story’s failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,” reports the highly anticipated, four-month study of how the magazine ended up publishing “A Rape on Campus,” an error-ridden account that focused on a supposedly savage (yet completely unverified) sexual assault at a University of Virginia frat house. The story, originally published Nov. 19, 2014, was recently deleted from the magazine’s website. The blockbuster narrative, by Rolling Stone contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely and based largely on the first-person account of a UVa junior and alleged rape victim identified only as “Jackie,” predictably provoked a firestorm of outrage when it was published last fall. Erdely’s story, which suggested an attitude of indifference at best and cover-up at worst by the UVa administration, prompted a different sort of outrage when her reporting—about Jackie’s claims of a gruesome gang rape at Charlottesville’s Phi Kappa Psi House in September 2012—quickly unraveled under scrutiny from The Washington Post, CNN, and other media outlets. The Columbia J-School study, which is 4,000 words longer than Rolling Stone’s retracted piece and presented in a tone of restrained neutrality, uncovered numerous instances of journalistic malpractice in the preparation of Erdely’s story: failure to contact and interview Jackie’s friends (to whom she claimed to have given contemporaneous accounts of the vicious assault); failure to verify the existence of the supposed fraternity member, allegedly a lifeguard at the same swimming pool where Jackie worked, who she claimed took her on a date to a Phi Kappa Psi frat party and witnessed and cheered on the gang rape; failure to provide fraternity officials with the specifics of Jackie’s account when asking for comment; and, worst of all, failure to verify the existence of and seek interviews with the alleged perpetrators of the felony. Yet the Columbia J-School study quotes Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana as stoutly defending the magazine’s procedures: “It’s not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don’t think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we’ve always done and just make sure we don’t make this mistake again.” Coco McPherson, the head of the magazine’s fact-checking department, which also comes under severe criticism in the study, likewise told the authors: “I one hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed. I think decisions were made around those because of the subject matter.” And in a comment that is bound stir up further controversy for a magazine that has had a festering PR problem since the article was published, Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner appeared to absolve his staff and blame Jackie in an interview published Sunday by The New York Times. Wenner “acknowledged the piece’s flaws but said that it represented an isolated and unusual episode and that Ms. Erdely would continue to write for the magazine,” the Times reported. “The problems with the article started with its source, Mr. Wenner said. He described her as ‘a really expert fabulist storyteller’ who managed to manipulate the magazine’s journalism process. When asked to clarify, he said that he was not trying to blame Jackie, ‘but obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.’” Wenner’s attempt to assign responsibility for the bogus story to the alleged victim—rather than the journalists on his payroll—echoed Dana’s initial reaction when the story began to collapse. “In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie’s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,” Dana wrote in an editor’s note—written “very quickly” and “under a lot of pressure,” according to Dana, and posted on Rolling Stone’s website as the journalistic catastrophe unfolded. The J-school study reports: “That language deflected blame from the magazine to its subject and it attracted yet more criticism. Dana said he rued his initial wording. ‘I was pretty freaked out,’ he said. ‘I regretted using that phrase pretty quickly.’ Early that evening, he changed course in a series of tweets. ‘That failure is on us—not on her,’ he wrote. A revised editor’s note, using similar language, appeared the next day.” The study reports that “the most consequential decision Rolling Stone made was to accept that Erdely had not contacted the three friends who spoke with Jackie on the night she said she was raped. That was the reporting path, if taken, that would have almost certainly led the magazine’s editors to change plans.” When they were interviewed by the Post and other outlets, Jackie’s friends contradicted major elements of her account. The study continues: “Erdely said that as she was preparing to write her first draft, she talked with [her editor Sean] Woods about the three friends. ‘Sean advised me that for now we should just put this aside,’ she said. ‘He actually suggested that I change their names for now.’ Woods said that he intended this decision to be temporary, pending further reporting and review.” Erdely “relied solely on Jackie’s information and wrote vividly about how the three friends had reacted after finding Jackie shaken and weeping in the first hours of Sept. 29,” the authors write. Erdely told them: “In retrospect, I wish somebody had pushed me harder” about reaching out to the three for their versions. “I guess maybe I was surprised that nobody said, ‘Why haven’t you called them?’ But nobody did, and I wasn’t going to press that issue.” The study concludes: “Of course, just because an editor does not ask a reporter to check derogatory information with a subject, that does not absolve the reporter of responsibility.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason Remaining a mystery in the J-School study—whose authors enjoyed unfettered access to Rolling Stone’s editors, fact checkers, and reporter along with article drafts, notes, and audio recordings of interviews—is how, why, and whether Rolling Stone’s in-house and outside lawyers approved Erdely’s rape story for publication. The attorneys, whose job is to limit the magazine’s legal exposure by ensuring that stories are solidly reported and factually supported, refused to talk to Coll et al, arguing attorney-client privilege. Editorial staffers likewise refused to discuss the legal advice they were given. The magazine now possibly faces a defamation lawsuit from Phi Kappa Psi, which has announced that it’s exploring its legal options. The Columbia J-School study concludes that Rolling Stone’s malfeasance amounts to “a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable.” The study continues: “The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine’s editors to reconsider publishing Jackie’s narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine’s reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.” In a statement timed to the study’s release, Erdely offered her “deepest apologies” to her Rolling Stone readers and colleagues, the UVa community, and “any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a result of my article.” She added: “Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgments in my reporting was a brutal and humbling experience.” With Erdely’s position at the magazine seemingly secure, managing editor Dana, fact checking chief McPherson, and Sean Woods, the article’s principal editor, apparently won’t face any disciplinary action, either. Wenner “has decided not to fire anyone on staff,” CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter reported on Sunday night. “He believes the missteps were unintentional, not purposefully deceitful.” ||||| The Rolling Stone story in question. Rolling Stone magazine just plain got it wrong. That's the conclusion of the massive (and massively long) piece penned by three officials at Columbia University journalism school, a report that details the fact that the story of a gang rape of a woman named \\"Jackie\\" at the University of Virginia was, in fact, simply not right. So, that's bad enough. What's worse is that the errors made by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the article's author, and the rest of the Rolling Stone editorial chain were entirely avoidable and encompassed the sort of basic reporting that every student in journalism school should know. Here's the Columbia trio on what happened: Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in \\"A Rape on Campus\\" is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from. Pretty damning stuff, right? Yes. And yet, Rolling Stone has apparently decided that this whole episode was just a blip on the radar and not at all the sort of thing that Erdely, her editor or anyone else should lose their job(s) for. \\"Sabrina’s done great work for us over the years and we expect that to continue,” Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana told The Washington Post via e-mail. Um, WHAT? I am not one to call for other reporters' heads when mistakes are made, as I have made mistakes before and had my head called for. But there are mistakes and then there are MISTAKES. A poorly chosen tweet or, in my case, a poorly conceived and unfunny parody, is one thing. Totally misreporting allegations of a gang rape in a hugely high-profile magazine story is another. One is poor judgement, often in the world of Twitter expressed (and regretted) in a millisecond. What Erdely did is journalistic malpractice, failing to do the basic blocking and tackling of reporting because, frankly, the story she had was just too good to check. Credibility and its less-often-mentioned-but-no-less-important cousin accountability are all that any journalist has in this business. The practice of journalism broadly imagined is based on lots and lots of individual reporters' credibility that eventually adds up to a reason why we should be trusted to tell you what you want and, more important, need to know. That's why what Erdely did -- and the stunning lack of accountability from Rolling Stone -- is so problematic for all of us who have dedicated our lives to journalism. Getting the story wrong -- and in such a major way -- obviously erodes our collective credibility. Failing to hold Erdely -- or ANYONE -- accountable for doing their jobs very poorly is even worse. It suggests that not only did journalism swing and miss but we are acting like we are still at the plate and nothing has happened. Is it any wonder that trust in journalism is down there near Congress levels? I've always been an ardent defender of journalism from those who insist that we've blown our chance at once again being the authoritative and objective force in society we once were. My argument has always been that, yes, there are a few bad apples, but most people are trying to do their jobs the best way they know how -- honestly and fairly. I still believe that. But, failures like this one by Erdely and Rolling Stone make it much harder for me to make that case even to myself. Society needs a Fourth Estate that it may not always agree with but that it believes is committed to getting it right and, when it doesn't, taking appropriate action. Rolling Stone did neither of those things with this story. And that's a shame for the rest of us. ||||| With an odd sense of fanfare, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism last night produced a 13,000-word report on Rolling Stone's profoundly flawed account of a gang rape at the University of Virginia, \\"A Rape on Campus,\\" that was published last November. Their conclusion? Rolling Stone fucked up a lot. Missing from Columbia's intense vivisection of the article, however, was a sense of responsibility: Whose fault was this crime against journalism, exactly? According to Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner, no one's, really. No one at the magazine, a baby-boomer favorite, will be dismissed for journalistic malpractice, even though Wenner loves to fire people for seemingly innocuous transgressions. Will Dana and Sean Woods, who edited the story, tried to resign in December, but were refused. Sabrina Rubin Erdely, who wrote the article, will continue to write for the magazine. Wenner, quoted in the New York Times today, is blaming the victim. The problems with the article started with its source, Mr. Wenner said. He described her as “a really expert fabulist storyteller” who managed to manipulate the magazine’s journalism process. When asked to clarify, he said that he was not trying to blame Jackie, “but obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.” This is an incredible statement coming from a magazine publisher with 40-odd years of experience and three titles under his belt (Us Weekly produces some great journalism) who is known for his mercurial temper and preference for workplace fastidiousness (apparently he values clean desks over clean journalism). Sure, there have been instances of publications getting hosed by young, manipulative employees (Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass), but blaming a source because you did not investigate her thoroughly enough is astonishingly idiotic. Here's what happened at Rolling Stone: pathological conflict-avoidance. Every workaround deployed in this story, from not securing the alleged rapist's name before publication to not interviewing the rape victim's friends, was put in place in order to avoid a difficult, uncomfortable situation. Underlying it all is sense of grand interpersonal failures. I'm not going to delve into writing Rolling Stone editorial fanfic, but it's fairly clear that something was awry between the personalities at play here. Whether it was regular workaday pressures—\\"Ahh, who has time to scrap the main gang-rape anecdote before deadline and get another?\\"—or something more insidious, whatever culture that bred this story is poisonous. And for Wenner, a rich, powerful 69-year-old man, to place culpability for his magazine's lapse on a twentysomething pseudonymous woman, well, that tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it? Later in the same Times article, Wenner goes from blaming the article's source to blaming the article's author. A step in the right direction, maybe, but notice here how Wenner paints Erdely as a reckless woman on a mission to bring down the story's editor with her: Ms. Erdely, Mr. Wenner said, “was willing to go too far in her effort to try and protect a victim of apparently a horrible crime. She dropped her journalistic training, scruples and rules and convinced Sean to do the same. There is this series of falling dominoes.” \\"Convinced\\" is an interesting word choice here. Who was in charge of this story? Certainly not Erdely. Was Woods's editorial judgment neutered by her passion for rape victims, as Wenner indicates? Considering Erdely's side of the story, as depicted in Columbia's report, Woods was neither a careful, rigorous, thoughtful nor attentive editor. The domino fall should have stopped with him, but it did not, because of his failings—whether he did not stand up to Erdely, did not push her enough, or was inexperienced with the subject matter. Instead, he chose to work around the problem at hand, defusing a potential conflict with Erdely and severely damaging the credibility of her story. Woods's lack of sensitivity and journalistic finesse is apparent in his boneheaded \\"apology:\\" \\"Ultimately, we were too deferential to our rape victim; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting,\\" Woods said in the Columbia report. \\"We should have been much tougher, and in not doing that, we maybe did her a disservice.\\" Maybe! In another article in the Times today (today is honorary Rolling Stone Fucked Up day in medialand), Jonathan Mahler, a media reporter, hints that gender might have had something to do with the nuclear fallout of the article. So what happened with “A Rape on Campus”? It is hard not to wonder if gender was a contributing factor. The magazine’s publisher and managing editor, and the editor of the article, were all men. Did that make them wary, consciously or not, of pushing back against a female writer’s account of a young woman’s rape? I'll go one step further than Mahler. Yes! Gender definitely had to do with how fucked up this article was. Consider Rolling Stone. A fine magazine, if you're into the Black Crowes, war, and Matt Taibbi. Will Dana and Sean Woods have edited some wonderful dispatches from Baghdad. But as the Columbia report starkly shows, they were clearly entirely out of their wheelhouse when it came to Erdely's report, and instead of, maybe, I don't know, consulting with women, asking women for help, or trying to understand what was at stake, they just barreled on forward like they were still on General McChrystal's plane (it's worth noting that both the head of fact-checking at Rolling Stone and the fact-checker on the story were women, but any higher-level editorial decisions did not fall to them). It brings to mind Grantland's Dr. V disaster—this is what happens when people who think they know everything get too swept up in a story and lose sight of reality. It's very bad. Rolling Stone's claim that it doesn't need to change anything institutionally is hilariously self-defeating. The ultimate fault of \\"A Rape on Campus\\" does not lie with a bad source, a bad journalist or a couple of bad editors. It falls on the empire's leader, Wenner, who should take full responsibility for the article, fire everyone involved, and then fire himself for being a dumb, sexist idiot.

At a time when almost everything Mrs. Clinton publicly says feeds presidential speculation, she has also used the speeches to address issues like the Arab Spring, the conflict in Syria and the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. Mrs. Clinton does not make her speechmaking schedule public, but the trade groups typically publicize the events. A spokesman for the former first lady declined to comment. But her political rivals have already started to keep tabs on her speaking schedule, looking for any hint of a conflict of interest. (So far, Mrs. Clinton’s staff appears to have carefully chosen where she has given speeches, avoiding paid talks to potentially controversial groups.) “We’re starting immediately to monitor both Hillary and the other Democratic rising stars and collect, tag and characterize their speeches so we can hold them accountable when the campaign begins in earnest,” said Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, a conservative political action committee. Mr. Miller said that it was too early to send operatives to covertly buy tickets to Mrs. Clinton’s speeches, but that the group was watching from a distance “to monitor whether she’s hobnobbing with investment bankers in New York City that might seem like favoritism down the line.” Since Mrs. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state, she has divided her time between writing a memoir and juggling a growing schedule of engagements, paid and unpaid.

Biden was trailing Christie 35 percent to 46 percent and was in a dead heat with Paul at 42 percent. Part of the explanation may be in the favorability numbers: 55 percent of those surveyed said they viewed Clinton favorably, compared with 38 percent who viewed her unfavorably. Biden, however, was underwater, with 44 percent viewing him unfavorably and 38 percent viewing him favorably. (PHOTOS: Who’s talking about Hillary 2016?) Christie was viewed 45 percent favorably to 18 percent unfavorably, and Paul was viewed 31 percent favorably to 28 percent not. Christie, however, was the only candidate that was viewed more favorably than not by members of the opposite party. Forty-one percent of Democrats surveyed viewed him favorably and 19 percent did not. Quinnipiac surveyed 2,014 registered voters by phone from June 28 to July 8 for the poll, which has an error margin of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. ||||| Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped down as secretary of state earlier this year, but there has been no shortage of Clinton on the national stage in the past two decades. (Nicki Demarco/NowThisNews) Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped down as secretary of state earlier this year, but there has been no shortage of Clinton on the national stage in the past two decades. (Nicki Demarco/NowThisNews) Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to Chicago last month to give a major speech in a cavernous convention hall. Her audience was 15,000 human resources professionals, and her remarks were tailored specifically to how immigration reform and President Obama’s health-care overhaul might affect their industry. In the six months since stepping down as secretary of state, Clinton has addressed apartment-complex developers in Dallas, private-equity managers in Los Angeles and business executives in Grand Rapids, Mich. Still to come are travel agents, real estate brokers, clinical pathologists and car dealers — collecting more than 200,000 per appearance, according to one executive who arranges speaking tours. This is how Clinton is cashing in on her star power as she weighs whether to run for the White House. The would-be Democratic front-runner is barnstorming the country, delivering speeches and answering questions at events sponsored by industry groups eager to gain access to someone who may be the next president. Clinton is the only leading 2016 contender giving paid speeches, with at least 14 delivered or scheduled so far, in part because ethics rules prohibit sitting lawmakers from doing so. Past presidential contenders, such as Republicans Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty, gave relatively few such addresses, and for much lower five-figure fees. A hectic speaking schedule is more common for those who have left electoral politics for good, including her husband, former president Bill Clinton — who has racked up tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees since leaving office — and other former secretaries of state, such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. 1 of 51 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Hillary Rodham Clinton: A political life View Photos Looking back at the career of the secretary of state and former senator and first lady.

June 1969 Hillary Rodham was photographed by Life magazine in Park Ridge, Ill., shortly after her graduation from Wellesley College.

Most of the trade groups Clinton has addressed actively lobby Congress on issues both substantial and mundane. The American Society of Travel Agents, which Clinton will address in September, wants airlines to provide data to travel agencies about baggage and boarding fees. The National Multi Housing Council, which Clinton addressed in April, advocates, among other things, low-interest loans for those who deal with bedbug infestations. When she spoke to the Society for Human Resource Management in June, association chief executive Hank Jackson said, “We were very pleased that most of her speech was tailored towards HR issues.” “She didn’t realize how intimately involved we are in providing feedback to Congress on how immigration from a practical perspective — not from a political perspective — is affecting businesses’ ability to manage talent,” Jackson said. “Giving her that insight was something that she could take away from the meeting.” Other audiences have many millions of dollars at stake in federal tax policies. In June, Clinton addressed an investor meeting in Los Angeles of KKR, the private-equity giant, and fielded questions from firm co-founder Henry Kravis. Her appearance, first reported by Politico, was confirmed by a KKR spokeswoman. Clinton’s spokesman declined to talk publicly about her speaking schedule. One person familiar with Clinton’s private speeches said she is not being lobbied at the appearances. “She’s talking about her experiences at State, and people have questions that are as you’d expect, but no one’s getting up and lobbying her,” said the person, who discussed the events on the condition of anonymity. Ron Kaufman, a Republican lobbyist and top adviser to former president George H.W. Bush, said such events allow groups to promote their agendas. “Whether they’re listened to is a different ballgame,” he said. “I think she’s not the kind of person who will be influenced by it, but they can establish pre-communications.” Clinton’s office does not publicly release her schedule, and most of her paid engagements are closed to the news media. The paid appearances are arranged through the Harry Walker Agency, which also represents her husband. The agency does not reveal her speaking fee. But one top executive at a rival speakers bureau, who requested anonymity to share internal industry details, said it is more than 200,000. Former president George W. Bush, by contrast, commands 100,000 to 150,000 per speech, as do former Bush administration officials such as Rice and Powell, the executive said. Only Clinton’s husband is on a par with her in speaking fees among political figures, the executive said. Many organizations that hire Clinton to speak heavily promote the booking, using her name and portrait to gin up registrations and sales for their conventions. “These speeches are what an ex-secretary of state, ex-senator, ex-first lady, someone who’s an international star, ought to be making,” said Mickey Kantor, a longtime Clinton family loyalist. “I don’t see anything unusual about it.” Not much time off When Clinton left office after traveling to 112 countries in four years, she described herself as exhausted and said she was looking forward to catching up with family and friends, watching home design shows (her favorite is HGTV’s “Love It or List It”), and writing her next book. She also had a blood-clot scare in January that landed her in the hospital for several days. “I just want to sleep and exercise and travel for fun,” she said in a New York Times interview late last year. “And relax. It sounds so ordinary, but I haven’t done it for 20 years. I would like to see whether I can get untired.” But Clinton, 65, has not taken much time off since. In addition to her paid appearances, she has given more than a dozen pro bono speeches — in some cases to accept awards, such as the American Bar Association’s ABA Medal, which she will receive in San Francisco next month. “I am pleased to see that she is not slowing down as Citizen Clinton,” former congresswoman Jane Harman (D-Calif.) said in introducing Clinton at a Bryn Mawr College event Tuesday. This fall, Clinton’s schedule picks up considerably. In November, Clinton will bounce from Orlando (the Learning 2013 education conference) to San Francisco (the National Association of Realtors) and back to Orlando (Press Ganey Associates, a health-care firm). Her 2014 calendar is starting to fill up, too, with a January booking before the National Automobile Dealers Association. Both Democratic and Republican operatives said the strategy is smart for Clinton, so long as she avoids controversial groups and focuses on nonpolitical and often business-friendly audiences. Clinton has addressed events aimed at both Democrats and Republicans, according to event organizers. When she was the keynote speaker a June gala for the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, one of the evening’s honorees was Amway President Doug DeVos, a prominent Republican whose family has given tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes. In May, Clinton was introduced by former Nixon secretary of state Henry Kissinger at an Atlantic Council black-tie gala in Washington. Council President Frederick Kempe said Kissinger “brought down the house when he alluded to her future presidential possibilities.” Former congresswoman Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Calif.), a Clinton friend and Atlantic Council leader, said: “It was a huge, blowout event. . . . There were so many people inside the Ritz-Carlton that you couldn’t move.” Clinton’s speaking schedule illustrates her deep network of contacts across industries. She agreed to give a paid speech to the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago this September in part, organizers said, because of the group’s work with the Clinton Global Initiative, her family’s charitable organization. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), a former aide to her husband, will introduce Clinton, and E. Blair Holladay, the group’s executive vice president, will ask her questions from the stage. Holladay said Clinton’s fee, which he would not disclose, will be covered by event sponsors, including some pharmaceutical companies. Holladay noted that when Bill Clinton addressed the group’s convention in 2011, he requested a spread of vegan food backstage. “I haven’t gotten any specific requests from Hillary,” he said. Presidential assumptions One of the first groups to book Clinton was the relatively low-profile Pacific Council on International Policy, which awarded her its inaugural Warren Christopher Public Service Award. The council’s co-chairman is Kantor, who served along with Christopher in Bill Clinton’s Cabinet. “I called her and there was not much hesitation whatsoever in accepting,” Kantor said, adding that she “took no fee at all.” The former first lady’s staff picked the date, May 8, and gave organizers about six weeks to plan the gala at the luxurious Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. “We sold out relatively early,” Pacific Council President Jerrold D. Green said. “What we all assume is that she is running for president.” Many of Clinton’s audiences assume the same. In April, when Clinton appeared in front of the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group of apartment complex developers, she did not deliver a speech. Instead, organizers asked her to pose for pictures with the group’s executive council and answer questions on stage from the group’s chairman, Thomas S. Bozzuto, a Maryland developer. “Naturally,” Bozzuto said, “she ducked my question when I asked her if she was going to run for president.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Sure, let me break it down for you. This story is about a woman named Mrs. Clinton. You might also know her as Hillary Clinton. She used to be the Secretary of State, which means she did a lot of important work helping to look after our country, especially in dealing with other countries around the world. Now, she's not doing that job anymore, but she's still really busy. Mrs. Clinton travels all around the country giving speeches to different groups of people. These people are usually doing special jobs like managing companies or developing houses. They all love to hear her talk because she's very smart and has lots of experience. Some people think she gets paid a lot of money for these speeches. At the same time, there are people keeping an eye on where Mrs. Clinton is going and what she's saying. They're interested because they think she might want to be the President of our country in the future. This is a really big job and a lot of people want to know if she's planning to do it. There are also polls, which are like little quizzes where lots of people tell you what they think about something. These polls say that many people like Mrs. Clinton and would like her to be our president. But there are other people that might also want to be president, like Mr. Christie, Mr. Paul, and Mr. Biden. The polls are trying to figure out who people might choose. For the most part, Mrs. Clinton spends her time delivering speeches, writing a book about her experiences, and helping out at the organization that her husband started, which is called the Clinton Foundation. The foundation does a lot of good work to help people, like girls and women around the world. Isn't it interesting to see what Mrs. Clinton is doing? I think she's a very busy lady!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence.

It usually wouldn't bother him on ordinary days, but today was different. He had a critical presentation due in the morning, and he needed absolute concentration and peace for that. Not to mention, this wasn't the first time the squeaky bed frame invaded his ears and attempted to disrupt his peace of mind. On multiple occasions in the past, he tried to overlook and ignore it, but tonight, the situation was more pressing. With a sigh of annoyance, he tried to bear it for a few more minutes, hoping against all hope that the noise would subside on its own accord or Joel would realize it without any prompt. His hopes fell flat, and it spurred a sense of desperation and resentment in him. He knew he had to intervene and decided it was high time to address this issue. Shaking off the irritation, he drew in a deep breath, readying himself for the upcoming confrontation. Aware of the consequences that his reaction might result in, he made sure to compose himself and choose his words carefully. Clenching his fists, he rose from his chair, determination etching prominent lines on his forehead. His feet dragged across the floor, carrying him close to the shared wall. Frustration merged with his desperation to sleep peacefully as he raised his voice just loud enough for Joel to listen, trying to penetrate the thin wall with his resonant voice. This was uncharted territory for him, as he usually prefered to avoid conflicts but the circumstances called out for direct action, pushing him out of his comfort zone. Gritting his teeth, he finally mustered the courage and called out firmly, \\"Joel, please, could you do something about that bed of yours? I need silence.\\" Thus, option (A). Donald yelled for him to be quiet, seems to be the most accurate description of the situation and how it unfolded. Whether or not his cry for silence would bring about a change was yet to be seen, but at least for tonight, he had taken the step he thought was necessary. The interruption from his critical project undoubtedly broke his train of thought, but he found strange comfort in raising his voice against the concern, solving it once and for all. He proceeded back to his laptop, hoping to regain his lost focus and tie all the loose ends of his presentation together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Understand the infield fly rule The infield fly rule is a rule in baseball and softball that is designed to prevent the defense from deliberately taking advantage of the baserunners, particularly when there is a potential for a double play. When the rule comes into effect, the batter is automatically out, regardless of whether the fielder catches the ball or not. Step 2: List the conditions required for the infield fly rule to come into effect The infield fly rule comes into effect when all of the following conditions are met: 1. There are fewer than two outs in the inning. 2. There are runners on first and second base, or bases loaded (runners on first, second, and third base). 3. The batter hits a fair ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, meaning it is neither a line drive nor a bunt.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again.

Which do you think the average person would know more/less about: Iranian cinema or Iranian football? Interestingly, the two come to the forefront of controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's latest film entitled 'Offside', a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to. The odd thing is, you don't come away from Offside having learnt about Iranian football or too much about Iranian cinema (unless it's an education in Panahi's controversial style), but you do come away feeling enlightened, that at least someone from Iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran, and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it. I can remember the 2006 World Cup, I'm sure many people can. It was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year, a summer of World Cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic. Needless to say, I saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in Spain '82 when it was thought West Germany and Austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of Algeria. Anyone in Britain that was watching the BBC's broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game, both nations' first of the tournament, may remember that at the top of the show, the BBC's football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match. It went something like: 'We've seen giants Germany, England, Argentina and Holland play but now we get to see.........Mexico and Iran battle it out'. The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore. It's a shame because there are people, and films like Offside present them, who are really willing to see Iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem 'inferior' when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage. When immediately thinking of the words 'Iran', 'football' and 'World Cup', my mind flies back to the France '98 game between said nation and America. Here is a film about a World Cup game of sorts involving Iran but where some or indeed most Iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around Iran's famous victory over The United States and what that meant to them, director Panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude. You can imagine a heavy handed film detailing Iran's 'victory' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they 'defeat' a Western power or 'enemy' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in. A couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 Indian film 'Lagaan', in which the Indian peasants defeat the ruling British at cricket. Similalry, 2005's 'The Game of Their Lives' sees the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between these films and Offside are immense; Offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of Feminism as the girls, trying to see their beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup, are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game. The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men 'may', not will, but 'may' use during the game. The film presents Iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder Panahi's film was itself banned in Iran. But Panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones, two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body/mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match. Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film 'Offside' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an 'attacker' is 'caught' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play. The parallels run with the womens' position in the film as these advancing (supposedly without right) individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team; that being the state itself. I think Offside is one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area that I've seen. It's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the IMDb and thus, the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all.

Which is most likely to happen after the crops are gathered? Pick the answer from these options","completion":"Unfortunately, the options to choose from are not provided in your question. Nonetheless, I can still provide you with a detailed answer about the scenario you've presented. After the farmer gathers the crops, the mice will have fewer places to hide. This change in the environment affects both the mice and the owl that rely on the field for survival. In situations like this, several outcomes are possible: 1. The owl's hunting efficiency increases: As the mice lose their hiding spots, it becomes easier for the owl to spot, catch, and eat them. This leads to the owl being more effective as a predator and potentially catching more mice than it did before the crops were harvested. 2. The mice population may initially decrease: As the owl's hunting efficiency increases, the mice population could initially decline. Fewer hiding places make it difficult for the mice to escape predators, and as a result, their numbers might diminish. 3. Adaptation in the mice behavior and habitat: Over time, the mice may learn to adapt to the new environment. They could change their behavior – for example, becoming more nocturnal – or move to other nearby areas offering better hiding spots and resources. This can help them avoid predation and maintain their population. 4. The owl might change its hunting strategy or behavior: If the owl's primary food source becomes scarce due to a decline in the mice population or a shift in the mice's habits or habitat, the owl may need to find other food sources or change its hunting strategy. Owls are adaptable predators, and they might also start hunting in different locations or move their territory in search of more abundant prey. 5. Balance in the ecosystem: Over time, the ecosystem may reach a new balance. As the organisms involved (the owl and mice in this case) adapt to the changes in the environment, they may find a new equilibrium that allows both populations to coexist. If the mice were overpopulating the field before the crops were gathered, the increased hunting efficiency of the owl might help to maintain a healthier balance between predators and prey. In conclusion, after the farmer gathers the crops, and the mice have fewer places to hide, the most likely outcome is that the owl's hunting efficiency will increase, leading to a potential initial decrease in the mice population. However, various adaptations and adjustments in both the owl's and the mice's behavior could help maintain a balanced ecosystem in the long term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To find out how many jellybeans are in y, we need to move all the jellybeans to one side. So, let's take away 696 jellybeans multiplied by y from both sides. This will help us know how many more jellybeans we have. 760y - 696y + 1664 = 696y - 696y When you take away 696 jellybeans times y from both sides, you will have: 64y + 1664 = 0 Now, it looks like this: you have 64 jellybeans times y plus 1664 candies equals zero. Let's find out how many jellybeans are in y. To do that, we need to move the candies to the other side. So, we take away 1664 candies from both sides: 64y = -1664 Now we only have 64 jellybeans times y on one side equals negative 1664 candies. We're close! Last step is to find out what y is by dividing both sides by 64: y = -1664 ÷ 64 Now, after doing this division, we find out: y = -26 So, our special number y is -26, which means minus 26.

He flies the world in a blood-red private jet, has an access-all-areas Formula 1 pass worth a cool £1 million and is fresh from the red carpet at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, resplendent in a solid gold chain worthy of a superstar rapper. And like most A-listers, this particular star is not without a few unpleasant habits. Support staff at the BBC awards can attest as much, having been tasked with picking up after him. Welcome to the world of Roscoe Hamilton, a two-year-old bulldog who lives a life of absurd luxury. Scroll down for video. Roscoe (centre) lounges about while on holiday with Lewis Hamilton and his other dog, bulldog bitch Coco. As the adored pet of Lewis Hamilton, reigning Formula 1 world champion, his is an existence of five-star pampering. Home is a £10 million apartment in Monaco, which he shares with Hamilton, his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and a bulldog bitch called Coco. Yet there is no question who rules the roost. Since padding into Lewis’s life in February 2013, Roscoe has taken centre stage. Take the family’s sleeping arrangements. Hamilton may be dating one of the most desired women on the planet in Nicole, but when the day ends, it is Roscoe who snuggles between the Egyptian cotton sheets alongside his master. (Ms Scherzinger is based for much of the year in America.) And as the racing driver jets between the U.S. and Europe in that gleaming £20 million Bombardier CL-600, he does so with Roscoe sitting beside him on his personal cream leather seat. Double act: The pair together at last night's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. Indeed, Roscoe has his own passport as well as that pass to the Formula 1 paddock, which was given to him by Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire overlord of the sport. Sponsors pay upwards of £1 million for these passes, yet Roscoe’s, which features a photograph of the bulldog in a pair of expensive Beats headphones, was a gift. While many people were nonplussed to see a celebrity turning up to the televised awards with his pet, to those who know Hamilton well it was no surprise to see the pooch waddling along the red carpet on Sunday night, complete with gold chain. Hamilton was wearing this jewellery at some of his public appearances towards the end of the Formula 1 season, and is happy to share his substantial worldly goods with his dog. This is a fastidious professional who obsesses over the tiniest detail to give him a racing advantage. Yet he allows Roscoe to play with his race helmet as if it was a toy ball. And this is no ordinary piece of kit. It takes three days to make one and they cost £3,300 apiece. That said, they are designed to withstand 800c flames and huge impacts, so an encounter with an enthusiastic bulldog is unlikely to cause too much of a problem. The helmet is adorned with an image of Hamilton with Nicole and — you guessed it — Roscoe. The extent of the driver’s canine infatuation has ruffled feathers, however, with questions raised about whether it is appropriate to allow a dog into the racing paddock. Legendary commentator Murray Walker did not mince his words: ‘I have the utmost respect and admiration for Lewis, but the F1 paddock is no place for a dog. Think of the safety reasons. Think, too, of how a dog’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human’s — and my hearing has been destroyed by F1 cars. I am utterly amazed he’s allowed to take the dog in. I can’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about. It’s madness.’ All of which presented a dilemma for Hamilton’s racing team, Mercedes. By that point, Roscoe had his own bespoke canine racing suit, while Lewis spent £220,000 on hiring a luxury motor home for the European season — because the hotels frequented by the Formula 1 hierarchy do not allow dogs. Some race tracks, seduced by the glamour of the driver and his designer dog, use them as an advertising tool. For the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap. Roscoe, however, does not sleep in a kennel. And when his master is otherwise disposed, only the very best treatment will do. The X Factor: A friendly nuzzle for Lewis's girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The singer spends half the year in America - leaving a space in the couple's bed for Roscoe to slip between the Egyptian cotton sheets. High flyers: UK-bound with Roscoe (left), Coco (centre) and Lewis Hamilton on board a private jet. Marie-Pierre Hansom, senior ‘host’ at Mercedes-Benz World in Surrey — the carmaker’s flagship centre — was left in no doubt about this earlier this year. Accustomed to dealing with the biggest star names, she was taken aback by what happened when the driver arrived to film a commercial. With Lewis fed, watered, made up and safely installed on set, she was settling down for a cup of coffee when the phone rang. ‘It was our reception desk advising me that two of his guests had arrived on site,’ she says. ‘Most of the entourage were here by then, so I thought: “Who could it be?” What's up, dawg: In Beats headphones. The two-year-old bulldog even has his own pass to the Formula 1 paddock. ‘I went to introduce myself and I’m faced with two little bulldogs. Panic inside, we don’t allow dogs in the building, what am I going to do? I need to move them pretty quickly. ‘I make it to the suite, get them set up very quickly. They need water, they need food, they need cushions. They had to be taken for various things such as comfort breaks. We even had to call the cleaning team for help at one point, because I don’t deal with things like that. I started the day expecting one celebrity. I finished it with three. ‘I hope I made them happy, and by the snores coming out of Roscoe I think they all had a good time.’ Since arriving in Hamilton’s life, Roscoe has become a social media star. There is footage of him in Lewis’s bed, on aircraft and even on a trip to a bowling alley. Hamilton, who doesn’t have children, is fond of dressing up his beloved dog in designer hats, headphones and jewellery. He also brings along Roscoe to interviews (on one occasion having to apologise when the mutt’s loud snoring drowned out his answers). Yet it’s plain Roscoe has fulfilled an important role in his master’s life. Raised in the rarefied atmosphere of motor racing, anointed as the chosen one since his teens, it is hardly surprising Hamilton is not the most worldly of individuals. Blessed — or cursed — with a prickliness particular to the uber-competitive, he clearly takes great comfort from the unquestioning adoration of his dogs. Roscoe was joined last year by the bulldog bitch Coco, yet she has been comparatively anonymous, due in part to health problems. She has had to undergo two tricky operations to treat a problem with her tongue, so by and large Roscoe has travelled with Lewis while she stayed at home. Lewis grew up with pet labradors, though, so why a bulldog? The answer may lie in his controversial relationship with his nationality. Playtime: Making friends with Lewis's nephew, Kalden, when Hamilton spent a day with his mother and sister. Roscoe has his own passport and for the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap. In his acceptance speech after winning Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday night, much was made of his pride in his British heritage. Yet this is a man who, the moment the big bucks started rolling in, decamped to Switzerland and then Monaco as a tax exile. Twitter immediately lit up with outraged comments about the BBC’s sporting champion not even paying a licence fee. He may believe that by having a British bulldog by his side, the public will subconsciously associate him with all things patriotic. But perhaps not when the dog is Roscoe Hamilton, surely the most pampered ‘non-dom’ in the canine world. Chilling out: The intrepid trio take to the slopes. Roscoe was joined last year by the bulldog bitch Coco, yet she has been comparatively anonymous, due in part to health problems.

Jason Leonard (born 14 August 1968) is an English former rugby union player, and has been the president of the Rugby Football Union since 2015. Nicknamed The Fun Bus, Leonard was a prop forward who won 114 caps for England and five for the British and Irish Lions. His total of 119 was a world record until 2006, when it was surpassed by George Gregan. Leonard played in England teams which won four Grand Slams (1991, 1992, 1995 and 2003) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and was part of the British and Irish Lions squad that won the test series during their 1997 tour of South Africa. With Dick Best no longer England head coach, the RFU appointed well-known and highly successful Bath coach Jack Rowell as his replacement. There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath's. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam. England held high hopes for the upcoming Rugby World Cup in South Africa. At the World Cup, England were drawn in Pool B, generally regarded as one of the easier groups in the competition. However, England experienced setbacks, gaining only narrow victories over Argentina (24-18) and Italy (27-20). In England's final pool match against Western Samoa, Leonard was rested and his record of 40 consecutive England caps ended. England won that match 44-22 and also won the subsequent quarter-final against Australia 25-22, before losing the semi-final to New Zealand 29-45 and finishing the tournament in fourth place. In November 1996, Leonard skippered England for the first time, against Argentina at Twickenham. The game was very close, with Argentina taking a narrow lead close to full-time. From a rolling maul, Leonard scored a try to level the scores, and a Mike Catt penalty won the game 20-18. The try remains Leonard's only score for England. In the 1996-1997 season, Leonard began to play for England at tighthead prop (number 3) to make room for Leicester Tigers loosehead prop (number 1), Graham Rowntree, and in 1997, Leonard was selected for his second British and Irish Lions tour, this time to South Africa. In September 1997, the RFU appointed Clive Woodward as head coach. The Autumn internationals saw England playing Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Against Australia, Leonard found himself selected at loosehead prop again, with Wasps' Will Green winning his first cap at tighthead. For the remaining two tests, Leonard was moved back to tighthead. The ability to scrummage effectively on either side of the scrum proved to be one of Leonard's great assets. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did they hold high hopes?","completion":"England held high hopes for the upcoming Rugby World Cup in South Africa because they had won their third Grand Slam in the 1995 Five Nations tournament, which showed that they had a strong and successful team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Nurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. Nurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \\"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\\" However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \\"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\\" In April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation. The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing, but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch, and the Associated Press wrote that \\"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\\" A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism. Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games. On 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25 miles) in 2:22:03.8 -- on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00, just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes. Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon. Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon. The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon. The Guardian reported that \\"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\\" and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury. Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: What is probably true about Kwon Hyuk-Chul?

Kwon Hyuk-Chul is a professor of security strategy at Kookmin University.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,... Why is there most likely support for Pres. Trump's tariffs? - Steel plants will prosper - not enough information - Other businesses will prosper - It will keep American jobs The answer to this question is:","completion":"There is most likely support for President Trump's tariffs because: 1. Steel plants will prosper: The tariffs aim to protect the domestic steel and aluminum industries, which have been struggling in recent years. Higher tariffs on imported steel and aluminum can make American-made products more competitive, potentially leading to increased production and profitability for U.S. steel plants. 2. It will keep American jobs: Supporters of the tariffs argue that protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industries can help preserve and even create jobs in these sectors. Some politicians, particularly Democrats from states with a strong manufacturing presence, believe that taking action against foreign competition is essential to protect American workers and preserve the long-term health of the U.S. manufacturing sector. 3. Concerns about foreign trade practices: Advocates for the tariffs also argue that other countries, particularly China, have been unfairly subsidizing their steel and aluminum industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. The tariffs are seen as a way to level the playing field and address these trade imbalances. Although there is support for the tariffs, there is also significant criticism and concerns about potential negative consequences, such as triggering a trade war and hurting U.S. businesses in other industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Conacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in 1925-26, then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series. He returned to Pittsburgh for the 1926-27 NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and 2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in 1926-27 and improved to 11 in 1927-28, but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in 1929-30, but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons. Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in 1932-33. He was named to the Second All-Star Team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club's first-ever Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens' Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL's First All-Star Team. On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL Second All-Star Team. Did he win any championships?","completion":"Yes, Lionel Conacher won multiple championships throughout his career. As a professional baseball player, he won the International League championship and the Little World Series with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Problem:In this darkly humorous thriller, James Caan portrays Romantic novelist Paul Sheldon, famously renowned for his trademark character, the film's namesake 'Misery' Chastaine. shortly after finishing his latest book, he drives of back to New York from the Silver Creek lodge. After a while, his car swerves off the icy road in a blizzard. In the car, he has a flashback in which he is talking to his agent (portrayed by Lauren Bacall) about his last Misery book. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who takes him back to her house for two days and reveales that she is his number one fan, hence the infamous quote \\"I'm your number one fan\\". When Annie asks if she can read his new book (in manuscript form) she proves to be more than a little eccentric when she lashes out in a fit of rage over the swearing in his book. When she leaves the room he seems fraked out and looks like he wants to leave quickly. The next day, Annie brings home a copy of the final Misery book and over the days reveals how many pages she has read. During which, she introuces him to her pet sow, Misery.The following night, she nearly kills him over the fact that he has killed Misery in his final book, tells him that she never called the local hospital (which she said she had) and threatens to kill him if anything happens to her. He immediately tries to escape but fails. The next day, Annie seems happy and tries to persuade him to burn the manuscript to which he seems reluctant. Later, she reveals she wants him to write a new book in which Misery comes back to life. When he sees a hairpin on the floor, he has an idea to buy time, he asks Annie to buy some different paper because his current paper smudges, to which she responds with another fit of rage. Whilst she is out shopping, Paul uses the hairpin to unlock his bedroom door and escape. However, he soon finds out that the front door is locked as well. He makes a visit to her living room and medicine closet. In the living room he accidentally knocks a small ceramic penguin off the table and puts it back the wrong way (this will become important later). He also realises that Annie's phone is a fake one, cancelling his chances of contacting the outside world. In the medicine closet, he takes some of the pills the Annie had been giving him for his fracture. He also tries to escape through her back door in the kitchen but cannot open it (I forgot to mention that he was bedridden for a few days and currently in a wheelchair). Soon, he hears Annie returning and immediately races back to his room. Fortunately, he gets back to his room in time just when she opens the door. She gets him back into bed and gives him a notepad and his pills (which he pretends to swallow).The following night, he saves up a lot of powder from the pills. In the morning, an argument starts between Paul and Annie about the book, which escalates into a humorous fit of rage about her growing up in Bakersfield watching chapter plays. Meanwhile, the local authorities find Sheldon's '65 Mustang buried in the snow. When Annie reads some of Paul's new manuscript she responds happily. Paul requsts that Annie have dinner with him to celebrate Misery's return. At the dinner, Paul makes a toast to Misery's return but asks if she has any candles. Whilst Annie is looking for them, Paul puts the powder in her wine. When she returns she almost makes the toast but drops her drink in the process, ruining Paul's plan.The next scene shows a line of clips of Paul writing the book. In the last clip, Annie gives him his pills and talks about committing suicide. When she leaves the house, he goes out of his room again and reads her scrapbook. It includes many newspaper clippings, revealing that she killed her father, her college roommate and many patients in hospitals. He grabs a knife from the kitchen and wheels himself to his room. Later, he awakens to the sight of Annie as she forcibly sedates him. In the morning, she ties him to the bed and reveals that she knows that he has been out of his room (the scrapbook, the ceramic penguin, the hairpin). Then, she 'hobbles' him (puts a block of wood betwen his feet and hits them with a sledgehammer)In the next scene, 'Buster' the local sheriff sees an emotional outburst in the town and researches her history. Later, he pays a visit to her house to look around. When he leaves, he hears a noise and goes back inside to find Paul in the basement and is shot by Annie. When she says she wants to kill him then herself, he requests finishing the book first. later, he is writing the book and requests 3 things: a cigarette, matches, and Dom Perignon champagne. When Annie returns, he also requests two glasses. whilst she is out of the room, he pours flammable liquid onto the manuscript and burns it, which escalates into a brawl resulting in Annie's death.18 months later, Paul is seen in a restaurant with his agent, refusing to write a book about his experiences.

These so-called green schools use less energy, cost less to run and are good for students. The newly renovated Sidwell Friends Middle School in the District has been awarded the highest rating by the U.S. Green Building Council for having a positive impact on the environment-a rare honor. Soon the school will treat and re-use its wastewater, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per year. The recycled water from sinks and toilets, which can't be used for drinking, will be color1ed blue, \\"so we know it's recycled, just in case it gets into the water fountains -not that it would,\\" joked Emily Bernstein, 14, a Sidwell student and building tour guide. Water fountains will still use fresh city water. Sidwell students are studying the building itself in science classes to help them learn first-hand the positive impact of green buildings. It's affecting how they view the world around them. \\"If you see a [building] being torn down, you think, 'They're going to fill up a whole landfill with that,'\\" said Matthew Malone, 13. In Prince George's County, Suitland Elementary has been so successful that another green school is being planned, in Laurel, for the 2008-09 school year. At Suitland, a garden courtyard collects and uses rainwater; the roof is angled away from the sun to keep it cool; and skylights and tall windows let in lots of natural light. \\"You don't have to switch on the light switch all the time,\\" said Rupert McCave, the county official guiding these projects.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Whether or not a given isotope is radioactive is a characteristic of that particular isotope. Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and decay through a characteristic form of emission. As time passes, less and less of the radioactive isotope will be present, and the level of radioactivity decreases. An interesting and useful aspect of radioactive decay is half-life, which is the amount of time it takes for one-half of a radioactive isotope to decay. The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant; it is unaffected by conditions and is independent of the initial amount of that isotope. Consider the following example. Suppose we have 100.0 g of tritium (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen). It has a half-life of 12.3 y. After 12.3 y, half of the sample will have decayed from hydrogen-3 to helium-3 by emitting a beta particle, so that only 50.0 g of the original tritium remains. After another 12.3 y— making a total of 24.6 y—another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 25.0 g of tritium. After another 12.3 y—now a total of 36.9 y—another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 12.5 g. This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 15.1 \\"Radioactive Decay\\".

Question: Combine facts and answer this: Which country was a British-born aviator for whom a movie starring Trevor Eve was based on fly as one of the first bush pilots in? Answer:","completion":"The country we are talking about is Australia. The British-born aviator referred to is Sidney Cotton. Sidney Cotton was a renowned figure in the aviation world for a number of reasons. Born in 1894 in Sussex, United Kingdom, he was not only a pioneer aviator but also an inventor, particularly gaining fame in the realm of aerial photography. The interesting thing about Sidney Cotton is that while he was British by birth, he spent a significant portion of his life in Australia. He initially moved there in 1911, involved in the early development of the Australian cotton industry. Eventually, he developed a keen interest in aviation and would go on to join the Royal Naval Air Service and British Royal Air Force during World War I. However, where his Australian adventures considerably stand out are his experiences as one of the first bush pilots in the country. Australian Bush flying refers to aircraft operations carried out in the bush. Bush flying involves operations in rough terrains where there are often no prepared landing strips or runways, frequently necessitating that bush planes are equipped with abnormally large tires, floats or skis. Cotton spent a significant period of his life flying over the outback of Australia, which significantly added to his fame and led him to be categorized as an integral figure in early Australian aviation. This exciting life of Sidney Cotton, his adventures, and contributions were not just limited to documentation and history books, but like many compelling narratives, they also found their way in the domain of cinema. A TV-movie named \\"Shooting The Past\\" was released in 1999 where Trevor Eve, a known British actor, played the role of Sidney Cotton. The plot of the movie is loosely based on his life as a spy and his innovations in the area of aerial reconnaissance photography. Therefore, to answer the query, the country in which the British-born aviator, for whom a movie starring Trevor Eve was based on, flew as one of the first bush pilots is Australia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rafael Edward Cruz (; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States Senator from Texas since 2013. He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Cruz was raised in Houston, Texas. After high school, he attended and graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Cruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \\"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\\". On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek re-election, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call. In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee; Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState; the FreedomWorks for America super PAC; nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin; Tea Party Express; Young Conservatives of Texas; and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, Mike Lee, Rand Paul and Pat Toomey. He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, George P. Bush, and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign. Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination with a 14-point margin over Dewhurst. Cruz defeated Dewhurst despite being outspent by Dewhurst who held a statewide elected office. Dewhurst spent 19 million and Cruz spent only 7 million. Dewhurst raised over 30 million and outspent Cruz at a ratio of nearly 3-to-1. In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic candidate Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote. According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas. After Time magazine reported on a potential violation of ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, Cruz called his failure to disclose these connections an inadvertent omission. In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report the nearly 1 million in loans on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law. Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the Federal Election Commission form. There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong. The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \\"inadvertent\\" and said he would be filing supplementary paperwork. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What are some notable aspects of the 2012 election?","completion":"Some notable aspects of the 2012 election, particularly in relation to Rafael Edward Cruz's victory in the Republican primary, include: 1.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine.

It is spoken by approximately 24 million people as a native language, mainly in Romania and Moldova, and by another 4 million people as a second language. Regarding the translation: 1. \\"Aceasta\\" (This) - This word is a demonstrative pronoun that refers to something specific or previously mentioned within the context. In this case, it is used to indicate that whatever has been previously discussed or analyzed is now coming to an end. 2. \\"încheie\\" (concludes) - This verb is derived from the Romanian verb \\"a încheia,\\" which means \\"to conclude\\" or \\"to bring to an end.\\" In our translation, it is used in the third person singular form, showing that \\"Aceasta\\" (this) acts as the subject of the sentence. 3. \\"explicațiile\\" (the explanations) - This word originates from the verb \\"a explica\\" which means \\"to explain.\\" In this context, \\"explicațiile\\" is a plural noun that refers to the explanations that have been given before the statement is made. 4. \\"votului\\" (of vote) - The word \\"vot\\" means \\"vote\\" in English. In this context, it translates to \\"votului\\" as the noun is in the genitive case, indicating possession or a close relationship between the vote and its explanations. The \\"-ului\\" is a common genitive ending in Romanian for masculine nouns. So, when you put all these words together, you have \\"Aceasta încheie explicațiile votului,\\" which translates to \\"That concludes the explanations of vote\\" in English.

This implies that there are tangible effects of low personal saving on the U.S. economy and society. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis claims that low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S., which contradicts the provided premise. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we need to examine whether there's supporting evidence for the premise's claim. Step 3: Evaluating evidence for the premise There is considerable evidence which supports the claim made in the premise: - Low personal savings can lead to greater reliance on foreign borrowing as the country needs to finance its consumption and investments. This, in turn, can increase the national debt and potentially expose the U.S. to financial risks, such as currency fluctuations and high interest rates. - Long-term economic growth can be affected negatively by low personal savings, as it reduces the capital available for investment in businesses, infrastructure, and other essential areas of the economy. This can result in slower economic growth over time. - Finally, standards of living for future generations can suffer if there is a lack of personal savings. This is because low savings leave fewer resources available for investments in education, healthcare, and other essential aspects of social wellbeing. This can undermine the quality of life for future generations. Step 4: Revisiting the hypothesis The evidence outlined above contradicts the hypothesis stating that low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S. The premise provides a clear link between low personal saving and effects on foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of living for future generations. Conclusion: Based on the examination of the evidence and the contradiction with the given premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"That low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S.\\" is not true."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

Empty the container of its contents. Wash and dry the inside. Using a flexible measuring tape or ribbon, measure the container so you can wrap it with the right amount of paper or fabric. Measure the circumference of the container; write down the measurement, adding one or two centimeters for overlap allowance. Measure the height of the container and write it down. This is what will turn your can from a boring food container to an attractive, personalized money box. Choose or cut out a piece of paper or fabric large enough to wrap all the way around the container. Lay the paper or fabric face-down on your cutting surface. After tracing out the rectangle, cut it from the paper or fabric using the outline as a guide. Once the rectangle is cut, wrap it around the container to make sure it fits properly. If it’s too large, trim it down to size. If it’s too small, begin again with a new piece of paper or fabric.

Carrie Fisher to haters: Youth and beauty are not accomplishments The first “Star Wars” installment in a decade has largely been met with jubilation, not least because Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher have reprised their classic roles as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess — ahem, General — Leia. Yet some longtime fans were stuck on a detail that shouldn’t have come as a surprise to anyone: Or, to zone in on the preoccupation, Fisher has aged — and allegedly “not well.” What this means is anyone’s guess. When the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds appeared on the big screen in “Return of the Jedi” wearing nothing more than a gold bikini, she instantly became the star of many a teenager’s fantasies. But that was more than three decades ago, and Fisher is now 59 years old. Not to mention, the latest iteration of Princess Leia is ostensibly no less formidable than the character that fans remember. She commands an entire resistance movement, after all, and manages to do so while remaining devoted to her family. Yet, discussion of Fisher’s weight has abated little since “The Force Awakens” premiered earlier this month. The actress, known these days for her wry repartee and Instagram-famous dog, shot back at her critics on Tuesday. Please stop debating about whetherOR not👁aged well.unfortunately it hurts all3 of my feelings.My BODY hasnt aged as well as I have.Blow us👌🏼 — Carrie Fisher (@carrieffisher) December 29, 2015 Youth&BeautyR/NOT ACCOMPLISHMENTS,theyre theTEMPORARY happy/BiProducts/of Time&/or DNA/Dont Hold yourBreath4either/ifUmust holdAir/takeGarys — Carrie Fisher (@carrieffisher) December 30, 2015 She also retweeted comments from supporters, including one who said, “Men don’t age better than women, they’re just allowed to age.” Another posted an image mimicking the “Star Wars” marquee opening that reads: “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….Someone else might have given a f—k.” Fisher let a couple of her dissenters have their say on her feed, too. She retweeted one “TomRoberts983a” who said, “So you want the money & adulation that comes with being a famous actor but not the criticism. Whoever told you life was fair?” This is the latest in a string of comments Fisher has recently made about being an older woman in Hollywood. In the first week of December, she lamented both that she had to lose weight for “The Force Awakens” and that it’s difficult for actress over 40 to find work. “They don’t want to hire all of me – only about three-quarters!” Fisher told Good Housekeeping, which reported that the actress was “pressured” to lose 35 pounds. “Nothing changes, it’s an appearance-driven thing. I’m in a business where the only thing that matters is weight and appearance. That is so messed up. They might as well say get younger, because that’s how easy it is.” Her co-star Hamill, 64, told Rolling Stone that he also had to diet for his role. [Carrie Fisher ‘was pressured’ to lose 35 lbs. for new ‘Star Wars’ movie] A few days later, Fisher told Good Morning America’s Amy Robach that there was no question of whether she would return to “Star Wars.” “I’m a female in Hollywood over the age of, let’s say, 40. We could also say 50,” she said. “You don’t have to ask if you want to work at that age.” With the exception of Meryl Streep, 66, and Halle Berry, 49, middle-aged women and older are underrepresented in entertainment. According to The Washington Post’s Danielle Paquette, the 100 top-grossing films of 2014 starred no women over 45. A University of Southern California analysis found that actresses of all ages were “dramatically outnumbered” by men in movies — a state of affairs likely reinforced by Hollywood’s predominantly male writers, directors and casting directors.

But then it was Susy's very triviality--so expressive of her characteristic irresponsibility--which had always affected him at such moments. Again, as at Robles, he felt it react against his own ethics. Was she not right in her delightful materialism? Was she not happier than if she had been consistently true to Mrs. Peyton, to the convent, to the episode of her theatrical career, to Jim Hooker--even to himself? And did he conscientiously believe that Hooker or himself had suffered from her inconsistency? No! From all that he had heard, she was a suitable helpmate to the senator, in her social attractiveness, her charming ostentations, her engaging vanity that disarmed suspicion, and her lack of responsibility even in her partisanship.

In contrast, the statement \\"They are very competent at their jobs\\" specifically addresses their job performance, focusing on their ability to execute their assigned tasks and responsibilities effectively and efficiently. Competence at work often implies having the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to perform one's duties up to the expected standards and excelling in achieving desired results. Given the context provided in the original statement and the analysis of each statement, it is reasonable to deduce that being a tremendously able group of Americans might be relevant to their job competence. The individuals in this group are portrayed as possessing exceptional abilities, which could be applicable in their professional lives. However, it is crucial to consider that \\"able\\" is a broad term and could refer to skills or talents unrelated to their jobs. Furthermore, it is important to analyze the context in which these statements are presented. If the conversation or discussion is centered around professional achievements, workplace excellence, or job performance, then it is more likely that the statement about being tremendously able can be linked to their job competence. Conversely, if the conversation is about general talents or unrelated domains, there might not be a direct correlation between the two statements. Having considered both statements and the context in which they might be presented, it cannot be definitively concluded that \\"They are very competent at their jobs\\" just based on the statement \\"They are a tremendously able group of Americans.\\" While it is common for exceptionally able individuals to perform well in their professions, we need additional information to establish a definite link between their abilities and their job competence. Additional context or clarification about their skills and how they relate to their job performance would be necessary to make a conclusive judgement."},{"prompt":"Q:- Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was What might be the last step of the process?

The reviewer expresses their disappointment and dissatisfaction with the product, discussing the issues they have encountered after changing the filter. Several aspects of the review suggest a negative tone: 1. The title itself, \\"Leaks!\\", instantly sets the tone by emphasizing the main issue they faced with the product. 2. The reviewer mentions that they are \\"not sure what happened with this machine,\\" which highlights their confusion and disappointment, given that the product had been working fine earlier. 3. The word \\"ruined\\" is used to describe the damage done to the bookcase, toys, and books, suggesting a significant level of dissatisfaction and frustration with the consequences of the product malfunction. 4. The reviewer has made attempts to resolve the issue by checking how the filter was installed and making sure the top was on securely, yet the problem persists. This emphasizes the negative sentiment, as they have not found a solution despite their efforts. 5. The review concludes with the statement \\"A total waste,\\" which is a strong indicator of negativity, implying that the product ended up being useless and, in this case, even caused damages to other items.

Question: He is beginning work at his first job. What is he feeling? Choices: - panic - resting - stress - excitement - working The rationale to choose \\"excitement\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Starting a new job is a significant event in a person's life. It's a transition into a new environment, with new responsibilities, new people, and new challenges that can evoke a range of emotions. One potential emotion a person might experience when starting a new job is panic. This would usually be due to feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Resting would not be an emotion but rather a state of being or activity, therefore can be eliminated from the choice. Stress is another valid possibility because the pressures associated with a new job, such as learning new tasks, fitting into a new team, and meeting expectations, can indeed be stressful. However, in this situation, the most appropriate answer would be \\"excitement.\\" Getting one's first job, in most cases, comes with a sense of achievement and anticipation. It is a milestone often greeted with eagerness as it usher an individual into a new stage of life, offering the prospect of personal growth and economic independence. The first job is also a platform to apply the knowledge and skills one has learned. Hence, these feelings of anticipation, eagerness, achievement, and novelty can all be associated with the emotion of excitement. Working, like resting, is also not an emotion but a state or activity one engages in. Therefore, it doesn't describe what the individual is feeling but rather what he is doing. Hence, in conclusion, while starting a new job may come with feelings of panic and stress caused by the unfamiliarity and pressures of the new role, the emotion that stands out as the most significant and initiating state is excitement due to the positive emotions linked to this distinct stage of personal and professional development.

Élaboration d'un guide législatif sur les opérations garanties Which language is this?","completion":"The language of the given phrase, \\"Élaboration d'un guide législatif sur les opérations garanties\\", is French. This sentence can be translated into English as \\"Development of a legislative guide on guaranteed operations\\". Developing a legislative guide on guaranteed operations would involve heavy research, deep understanding of the current legislation, and detailed knowledge on the topic of “guaranteed operations”. 1. Understanding Guaranteed Operations: First and foremost, one should understand what is meant by \\"guaranteed operations\\". This likely refers to financial operations that have some kind of guarantee attached, such as a government guarantee. These guarantees often come into play in situations of loans or investments, ensuring that even if the borrower defaults or the investment fails, the lender/investor will be repaid up to a certain amount by the party providing the guarantee. Understanding the mechanics of how these operations work is crucial in developing the legislative guide. 2. Survey of Existing Legislation: Once the concept of guaranteed operations is clear, extensive research on existing legislation needs to be conducted. This will involve understanding different statutory regulations, case laws, and obligations attached with the guaranteed operations. 3. Stakeholder Analysis: Understanding the demographics of your audience is crucial when developing a legislative guide. Knowing who this guide will be used by, for example- financial institutions, government agencies, potential lenders, or investors, will shape the language, detail level, and complexity of the guide. 4. Structure of the Guide: A well-structured guide will comprise an introduction (explaining the purpose and aim of the guide), main body (explaining the detailed legislation and any points of consideration), possible scenarios or case studies, FAQ section (with questions likely to be asked by the stakeholder it is designed for), and a conclusion summarizing the overarching theme. 5. Regular Updates: Lastly, the guide should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it reflects the latest legislative changes. Remember, the objective of the legislative guide should be to simplify the understanding of legislations around guaranteed operations, providing a clear and unambiguous pathway, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The Division of Mayo is an Australian electoral division named after Dr. Helen Mayo, a renowned female Australian medical doctor, medical educator, and social activist. Helen Mayo was born on October 1, 1878, in Adelaide, South Australia, and played a significant role in the advancement of women's rights and child welfare in Australia throughout her career. Dr. Mayo completed her medical studies at the University of Adelaide and became one of the first women to graduate with a Bachelor of Medicine in 1902. She later furthered her education in England, gaining valuable experience in pediatrics and undertaking research in bacteriology and pathology. Upon her return to Adelaide, Dr. Mayo dedicated herself to improving the health and welfare of women and children. In 1909, alongside Dr. Harriet Stirling, Dr. Mayo founded the School for Mothers (which later became the Mothers and Babies Health Association), a pioneering initiative offering consultations and educational materials on childcare and hygiene to mothers around South Australia. This organization played a vital role in reducing infant mortality rates and improving the health of women and children in the region. In addition to her work in women's and children's health, Dr. Mayo was a tireless advocate for education and opportunities for women. She was the first woman elected to the University Council at the University of Adelaide in 1914 and was crucial in establishing the Women's Union at the university. Dr. Mayo's significant contributions to public health, education, and social reform made her a leading figure in South Australia during her lifetime.

Outside the White House Friday, a media frenzy. And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together. That is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\" Trump also lashed out at opposition Democrats and tried to blame them for recent administration actions to separate family members caught trying to come across the U.S. border. “The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children,\\" Trump said. According to the above context, answer the following question. When did the media frenzy occur?

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\"?

Article: Each player attempts to get the football to their opponent's side. You decide how many attempts each player is allowed. Pushing the football across can be considered cheating, so it depends on how you and your opponent would like to play. To get the ball across, place the football on your side of the field so that one corner is slightly off the edge of the surface. Then “flick” the corner of the ball hanging off the side with your index finger. When the football is down the field and you are allowed another attempt, you can lightly tap it forward with your index and middle fingers. Flip a coin to decide who starts first. Once you get the football to your opponent's side in the allotted attempts, you are in touchdown territory. In order to score a touchdown, one part of the football must hang off the opponent's edge. A touchdown is worth 6 points, if you want to follow actual football guidelines. Yet, if you want to keep the game simple, make each touchdown 1 point. To double check if the football did in fact hang over the edge to score a touchdown, bend down so that you can look upwards at the bottom of the surface edge and the football. This angle will make it easier to determine if a piece of the football is past the edge. Once you score a touchdown, you can kick a field goal to get extra points. Have your opponent do finger goal posts, or place down the goal post you made, at their side of the field. If you can kick the football between the goalposts, you get 3 points if following football guidelines or 1 point if keeping the game simple. To kick a field goal, place the football vertically, pressing one point with your index finger onto the surface. Hold it there to keep it steady, and when you are ready, flick the football with your free index finger towards the goal posts. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article describes a tabletop football game played by flicking a small football across a surface with the aim of getting it to the opponent's side. Players are given a certain number of attempts to move the ball, and scoring can be simplified to 1 point per touchdown or follow actual football guidelines with touchdowns worth 6 points and the option to kick a field goal for extra points.

He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would fork B's wave have more or less energy than fork A's wave? Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) Answer:","completion":"Fork B's wave would have less energy than fork A's wave because fork A has a higher frequency, which requires more energy, as explained in the hint.

Please write a short summary for the following article: UK man pleads guilty for failed Donald Trump assassination attempt A British man has pleaded guilty to charges that could get him about two years in a US prison and deported for trying to grab a police officer's gun to shoot Donald Trump at a June campaign rally in Las Vegas. Michael Steven Sandford entered the pleas to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function. \\"I tried to take a gun from a policeman to shoot someone with, and I'm pleading guilty,\\" Sandford told the judge. Sandford could have faced up to 20 years in a US prison if he had been convicted at trial of both charges. Sandford, 20, was arrested on June 18 after trying to grab the gun in a 1500-seat venue at Treasure Island hotel-casino. Sandford didn't get the gun, and no shots were fired before he was arrested. Sanford entered his pleas after his mother, Lynne Sandford, and a lawyer arrived from London and met with him in custody last week. Family lawyer Saimo Chahal said a psychiatrist she enlisted to review the case determined that Sandford was delusional at the time of the attempted attack. Sandford also suffers seizures, obsession-compulsion, anxiety and autism spectrum disorders, Chahal said. \\"Michael was not in control at the time of the events and needs help,'' the lawyer said in an email before the plea in US District Court in Las Vegas. \\"He is desperate to return to the UK to be near his family as he has no ties with the USA.\\" Court documents say Sandford acknowledged asking the police officer at the event if he could get Trump's autograph then reaching with both hands for the officer's 9mm handgun. Sandford later told a federal agent that he drove from California to Las Vegas with a plan to kill Trump, and that he rented a 9mm pistol and fired 20 shots at a paper target at a Las Vegas gun range the day before Trump's appearance, according to court documents. He also said he expected he would be killed during the assassination attempt, but that if he wasn't, he would make another attempt on Trump's life at a rally in Phoenix, court documents state. As a result of his plea, \\"It is almost certain that he will be permanently removed ... and will not be able to return to the United States at any time in the future,'' the document said. Summary:","completion":"A man from the UK tried to take a police officer's gun to shoot Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas. The man, named Michael Steven Sandford, said he was guilty and could spend around two years in a US prison before being sent back to the UK. Michael didn't get the gun and no one was hurt. His lawyer said Michael wasn't thinking clearly at the time and needs help.

Summarize: Stand with your feet facing forward and use a straight surface like the edge of a rug, a wall, or a yoga mat to align one foot and then the other so that the feet are facing straight forward. This may feel strange at first. Try to adjust your foot position whenever you can remember. Schedule some time at home to walk around barefoot. This can increase foot dexterity and stretch the muscles. Sit with your legs strait and your feet flat against the wall. Place a pillow underneath your buttocks. Lean forward with your back straight. Hold for 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds and repeat 3 times. This stretch is especially important for people who wear high heels. Lie on your back with your buttocks a few inches from the wall. Place your legs in a \\"V\\" and straighten them. You should feel a stretch in your inner thighs and your arches. Lying with your feet elevated above your chest can also help to reduce swelling. There are a few easy moves that can help stretch your toes and provide relief. Try curling your toes around a pencil so that they can hold it up. Hold this pose for a few seconds before releasing the pencil. You can repeat this 2-3 times. You can also try picking up small objects like marbles or markers. Sit down and put your right foot over the top of your left thigh. Place the fingers of your left hand between the toes on your right foot. This helps to widen your toes and stretch them. Do this stretch for 1 to 5 minutes, and then repeat it on the opposite side. Rub sore feet with a topical gel that contains an anti-inflammatory aid. The act of rubbing feet may also relieve muscle tension. Treat foot soreness with the Rest, Immobilization, Cold, and Elevation (RICE) method if your foot pain is acute. Rest your feet when they start to hurt. Place an ice pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel on the most painful parts of your feet and wrap them with a bandage or towel. Elevate your feet so that they are above your heart in order to reduce inflammation. You can also try the Movement, Elevation, Traction, and Heat (METH) method. While RICE helps reduce swelling and pain, METH can increase blood flow and promote healing.","completion":"The text provides a comprehensive guide on how to care for, stretch, and strengthen your feet through exercise, proper positioning, and other methods. It's crucial for maintaining foot health, especially for those who wear high heels. Starting with foot positioning, your feet should face forward and you can use a straight surface, such as a rug, wall, or yoga mat, to ensure the correct alignment. This might feel unfamiliar at first, but with time, the foot adjustment will become more natural. Walking barefoot at home is also advisable to enhance foot dexterity and stretch muscles. Certain stretches are also beneficial for foot health. Sitting with legs straight, feet flat against the wall, and a pillow underneath your buttocks and leaning forward with a straight back is one such stretch. You should perform this stretch three times, holding it for 10-seconds each and resting in between. This stretch can be particularly helpful for high heel wearers. Lying on your back, with your buttocks close to the wall and legs in a \\"V\\" position, is another useful stretch. It targets inner thighs and foot arches. Having your feet elevated above your chest while lying can also help in reducing swelling. Next is toe exercises. To stretch your toes, try holding a pencil by curling your toes around it and hold the position for a few seconds, then repeat it 2-3 times. Picking up small objects, like markers or marbles, can also be tried. Another toe stretching exercise includes sitting down and placing your foot over your other thigh and inserting the fingers of your non-stretched leg's hand between the toes of your stretched leg for 1 to 5 minutes. This should be repeated for the other side too. For sore feet, use a topical gel with an anti-inflammatory aid. This, in combination with the act of rubbing the feet, could alleviate muscle tension. Acute foot pain can be eased with the RICE (Rest, Immobilization, Cold, and Elevation) method. Rest when feet start to hurt, apply an ice pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel to the painful areas and bandage them, and then elevate your feet to a level above your heart to lessen inflammation. Alternatively, increasing blood flow and promoting healing can be achieved with the METH (Movement, Elevation, Traction, and Heat) method. Although RICE is beneficial for reducing swelling and pain, METH focuses on healing through improved blood circulation.

Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (; Spanish pronunciation: [en'rike mi'gel i'glesjas 'preizler]; born 8 May 1975) is a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. He is widely regarded as the King of Latin Pop. In 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled Quizas (Perhaps). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father. The album debuted at number twelve on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish language album on the chart at that period. Quizas sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. The three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number one singles on Billboard's Latin Chart. His last single from the album, \\"Para Que La Vida\\", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only Spanish language song to do so. The video to the song \\"Quizas\\" was the first Spanish language music video to be added to the selection on one of MTV's popular shows, Total Request Live. Iglesias performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, becoming the first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as Ricky Martin, Juanes and Jorge Drexler to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias included songs from Quizas in his \\"Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour\\", and the album went on to win the Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. By 2003 Iglesias released his seventh album, which he called 7, the second to be co-written by Iglesias. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \\"Roamer\\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist, Tony Bruno. The CD also contained the song \\"Be Yourself\\", a song about independence (the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career). The first single was the song \\"Addicted\\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \\"Not in Love\\", featuring Kelis. With this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at Houston Rodeo and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt and Singapore before ending his tour in South Africa.

In the coastal redwood forests of central California, scientists trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the reproductive problems of dozens of endangered condors think they have uncovered the culprit: the long-banned pesticide DDT. The soaring scavengers with wingspans wider than NBA players are tall were reintroduced to the rugged coast of Big Sur in 1997 after a century-long absence. Upon arrival, the birds found plenty to eat, with dead California sea lions and other marine mammals littering the craggy shoreline. While a good food source, sea lion blubber often has high levels of DDT, a pesticide banned in 1972 that has proven to be a persistent pollutant because it accumulates in bodies of creatures throughout the food chain when animals eat one another. Endangered: Condors on California's central coast are having reproductive problems because of DDT. Once used widely in agriculture, DDT was banned because it is a human toxin considered a possible carcinogen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kelly Sorenson, executive director of Ventana Wildlife Society and a co-author of a new study on condors, said researchers who spent six years studying their reproductive problems have 'established a strong link' to DDT in the birds' food source. The peer-reviewed paper written by 10 condor experts, including biologists from the Los Angeles and Santa Barbara zoos and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is being published this month in the University of California journal 'The Condor.' 'In science, rarely is anything definitive but we've established a strong link between ... DDT and eggshell thinning in California condors,' said Mr Sorenson. Dinner time: Condors feed on the remains of a marine mammal on a beach in Big Sur. The eggshell mystery began in 2006, when a biologist inspecting a condor nest in the cavity of a redwood tree on the central California coast found the first thin shell. Over the next six years, the scientists observed condors feeding on dozens of sea lions, and found that the Big Sur condor population had a low hatching success — just 20-40 percent — for 16 nesting pairs. In contrast, 70-80 percent of southern California condors in the Tejon area had hatched successfully over the same time. The southern California condors are inland, and sea lions are not a food source. Biologists familiar with the ravages of DDT in bird populations immediately suspected the widely used pesticide as a factor. Tests since the 1970s have found high levels of DDT in sea lions; and studies have linked DDT's metabolized version, DDE, to egg shell thinning in birds, including brown pelicans and bald eagles. Majestic: Condors wingspans are wider than NBA players are tall. The condor study attributed at least eight of 16 egg failures to thinning from DDT. One shell found crushed in a nest was 54-percent thinner than normal. Thinning can also allow bacteria to more easily enter the eggs. But why did the sea lions have such high DDT levels in the first place? The scientists theorize that the sea mammals were exposed when they migrated to the central coast from southern California, where the Montrose Chemical Corp. dumped DDT with impunity for decades until the 1970s. The Montrose plant and the ocean off Palos Verdes where it dumped DDT are now listed as Environmental Protection Agency 'Superfund' sites. Less hatching: California condor eggs hatch less than half as much on the central coast than they do to the south. 'A vast majority of California sea lions have spent at least a portion of their lives in the waters of southern California, which is the most DDT-contaminated coastal environment in the world,' Mr Sorenson said. 'Northward movements of sea lions provide a pathway of DDT to condors in central California.' The study's authors and other experts agree that lead ammunition, not DDT, is the main threat to the survivability of condors. But Jesse Grantham, a former condor program coordinator for Fish and Wildlife who did not participate in the study, called the paper's findings helpful scientific evidence that will add to the overall picture of threats facing condor recovery. Another former condor program manager, Noel Snyder, was critical of the DDT study, however. He said it only looks closely at one potential cause of reproductive problems — DDT — and fails to properly evaluate the potential effects of other contaminants and factors that may be involved and more important. 'DDT is not the only thing that causes. eggshell thinning, and the authors of the paper don't present a. significant correlation of DDT with the thinning found, and thus do not. do a convincing job of linking DDT with the happenings in Big Sur.' Big Sur: Though beautiful, Big Sur is contaminated with DDT. Study author and Ventana wildlife biologist Joe Burnett defended the team's work, saying all data pointed to the pesticide as the problem. 'We collected data on many different environmental toxins but none, other than DDE, were even in the ballpark known to cause reproductive failure in birds,' Mr Burnett said. In the final analysis, the study's authors say the DDT problem will fade over time. 'Like bald eagles and other bird species previously affected by DDT, the thickness of condor eggshells should recover as contamination declines in the coastal environment,' said co-author Robert Risebrough, an expert on the effects of DDT on birds. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Scientists believe they have found a link between the reproductive problems of endangered condors in coastal redwood forests in central California and the long-banned pesticide DDT. 2. The condors were reintroduced to Big Sur in 1997 after a century-long absence and often feed on dead California sea lions, which have high levels of DDT in their blubber. 3. DDT, a human toxin and possible carcinogen, accumulates in the bodies of creatures throughout the food chain. 4. Researchers found a strong link between DDT and eggshell thinning in California condors, leading to low hatching success rates. 5. The scientists theorize that the sea lions have high DDT levels due to migration from southern California, where the Montrose Chemical Corp. dumped DDT until the 1970s. 6. The study's authors and other experts agree that lead ammunition, not DDT, is the main threat to condors' survivability but the research adds to the overall picture of threats facing condor recovery. 7. The study's authors believe the DDT problem will eventually fade over time as contamination declines in the coastal environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that finds a half finished plate of food? On October 29, 1993, Beatrice High School student Charlie Grimille is accidentally hanged and killed after a prop malfunction during a presentation of the play \\"The Gallows.\\" His parents, along with the whole audience, witness the tragic event. Twenty years later, on October 28, 2013, the school attempts to put on a new performance of \\"The Gallows.\\" Reese Houser is excited, as this gives him a chance to grow closer to his crush Pfeifer Ross. His friend Ryan Shoos is dismissive of the play, and comes up with the idea to vandalize the set. Reese is reluctant to take part, but agrees when Ryan promises that he'll be able to console Pfeifer afterwards, giving them a chance to kiss. Later that night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school, only to run into Pfeifer, who saw Reese's car. Knowing they cannot vandalize the sets with Pfeifer there, the group tries to leave, but finds that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception. Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school, which angers Pfeifer. As the group tries to look for a way out of the school, they find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They also discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick. The group becomes separated when Reese runs off with the camera, with Ryan being left alone. As he searches for Reese, he sees various things, such as a half finished plate of food, a cup of coffee, a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and what looks like a body hanging from above. When the group is reunited, they hear footsteps above them that stop above Cassidy. She is then yanked into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns.

Q: Context: Recent psychopharmacological studies lend support to the notion of partially dissociable neuronal systems dedicated to processing specific emotions. For example, GABA-ergic enhancement after an acute dose of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, produces specific impairments in anger and fear recognition. However, it is unclear if these impairments are a general property of benzodiazepines and other drugs that produce a similar profile of neurocognitive impairment to benzodiazepines, such as the anticholinergic, scopolamine.', 'We investigated the effects of scopolamine and the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, on emotion-recognition accuracy.', 'A double-blind independent group design was used with 48 healthy volunteers to compare the effects of scopolamine and lorazepam with an inactive placebo on a commonly used emotion-recognition task. Control measures included an episodic memory task and subjective mood ratings.', 'Anger and disgust recognition accuracy was impaired after scopolamine. In contrast, lorazepam produced no impairment in emotion-recognition despite producing similar levels of sedation and anterograde amnesia to scopolamine. Answer: Scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction selectively impaired the recognition accuracy of disgust and anger facial expressions. The effects of scopolamine on emotion-recognition are similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients. Furthermore, the impairments in anger and fear recognition previously observed with diazepam do not appear to be a general property of benzodiazepines. This suggests that alterations in emotional processing involving changes in the ability to recognize threat-related emotions (particularly, fear and anger) may not be a principal mechanism underlying anxiolysis or paradoxical aggression seen with benzodiazepines.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... How persuasive does the North Korea leader likely think his claim that he had missiles that could reach the US was, following the summit conclusion? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. probably not believable at all B. not enough information C. likely very convincing D. not too persuasive A:","completion":"C. likely very convincing Given the context of North Korea's missile tests and the increased tension between the country and the United States, it is probable that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un believed his claim regarding the missile capability was quite convincing. The claim likely contributed to prompting diplomatic negotiations and the U.S.-North Korean summit, significantly changing the tone of the dialogue between the two nations. Pyongyang's shift to diplomacy, coupled with the show of force by successfully test-firing missiles it claimed could reach the United States, provided the world with a glimpse of North Korea's arsenals and potential capabilities. The fact that an unprecedented summit took place between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader suggests that both sides felt the pressing need to discuss and address the security threat. Furthermore, North Korea's past behavior of not adhering to agreements, as mentioned by Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife from Seoul, might also suggest that Kim Jong Un felt confident in his claims. In the recent years, North Korea has been focused on developing and showcasing its missile technology, which has alarmed the international community. In conclusion, while the North Korean leader might be over-estimating the credibility of his claims, based on the events leading up to and following the summit, it can be asserted that Kim Jong Un likely perceived his claims of missile capabilities reaching the U.S. as very convincing (option C). However, it should be noted that this analysis is based on an assumption about Kim Jong Un's beliefs and not an absolute fact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Interpol has issued an international wanted notice for conservationist and “Whale Wars” TV star Paul Watson, days after he skipped bail in Germany as Costa Rica tried to have him extradited. Watson was arrested at Germany’s Frankfurt airport on May 13 on an arrest warrant issued by Costa Rica, which accuses him of endangering a fishing vessel off the coast of Guatemala in 2002. He posted roughly 302,000 bail and was ordered to remain in Germany as it considered Costa Rica’s extradition request, but he stopped reporting to authorities on July 22, a German court said. Watson left Germany and forfeited his bail, according to his Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which isn’t revealing his location. “Following confirmation from German authorities that Paul Watson had failed to satisfy the bail conditions established by the German courts and had fled the country, Costa Rican authorities renewed their request” for Interpol to issue an international wanted notice for Watson, which Interpol did Tuesday, Interpol said. Costa Rican authorities allege that Watson – whose attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame on Animal Planet’s “Whale Wars” TV show – and his crew aboard Sea Shepherd’s Ocean Warrior ship endangered a Costa Rican fishing vessel during a confrontation off Guatemala’s coast. The U.S.-based Sea Shepherd denies the allegations, arguing that the charges have less to do with law than with Watson’s anti-conservationist enemies. In the 2002 incident, according to Sea Shepherd ship operations officer Peter Hammarstedt, the Ocean Warrior found a Costa Rican crew killing sharks for their fins in Guatemalan waters. The Ocean Warrior initially had permission from Guatemalan authorities to stop it and tow the vessel into port, he said. The Ocean Warrior used water cannons on the fishing vessel, but “there were no injuries and no physical damage to any ship,” Hammarstedt said in May. The Ocean Warrior did stop the ship, but Guatemalan authorities eventually asked Watson to release it, Hammarstedt said. The confrontation is detailed in part of a 2007 documentary, “Sharkwater,” Hammarstedt said. Shark finning is the practice of cutting the fins off sharks and throwing the sharks back into the sea, where they die. The fins are used for expensive soup, mostly in China. The current charge, according to Interpol, is “causing a danger of drowning or of an air disaster.” Sea Shepherd says that “anyone who’s viewed the documentary can clearly see the charges are bogus.” “The water cannon Captain Watson allegedly used to stop the illegal shark finners never reached the wheelhouse, thereby having no possibility of interfering with their safe navigation, nor were there any aircraft overhead at the time so as to potentially cause an ‘air disaster,’” Sea Shepherd said in a statement issued Wednesday. Interpol’s wanted notices, called red notices, are sent to police agencies across the world, but they are not arrest warrants. “Each of Interpol’s 190 member countries must apply their national laws and standards in determining whether it may detain or arrest the wanted person,” Interpol says.

They both agreed this region has run out of fresh water and are using sea water or treated wastewater in their district cooling and refrigeration. Water scarcity continues to be a pressing issue, affecting not only human beings and their livelihoods but also various industries and ecosystems around the world. Nowhere is this scarcity more evident than in the Middle East, a region that has faced chronic water shortages for decades. Experts and analysts have been raising alarms about the urgency of this situation for years, calling for immediate and long-term solutions to address this critical challenge. The Middle East, predominantly composed of arid and semi-arid regions, experiences high temperatures throughout much of the year, which have only worsened due to climate change. This has led to an ever-increasing demand for water resources to meet the needs of its growing population and support its thriving agriculture and industrial sectors. The rapid growth of cities in the region, along with rising industrialization, has only served to exacerbate the problem. In a recent discussion between two experts, they both agreed that the Middle East has run out of fresh water resources, particularly due to significant over-extraction of groundwater, recurrent droughts, and the limited number of renewable water sources. This has forced many countries in the region to look for alternatives to meet their water needs. One such solution being adopted by several Middle Eastern nations is the utilization of sea water or treated wastewater in district cooling and refrigeration systems. These systems work by redistributing cooled or heated water to reduce the need for individual air conditioning units or heating systems, thus conserving energy and alleviating pressure on dwindling water resources. By incorporating treated wastewater or seawater, district cooling and refrigeration systems are designed to minimize the use of fresh water and efficiently manage water resources. The use of seawater for cooling and refrigeration systems is a relatively straightforward process, with the water being pumped, filtered, and treated before being used in the systems. On the other hand, the reuse of wastewater in these systems involves a more complex set of technologies to remove pollutants and contaminants from the water to ensure it is safe for use. Despite the innovative initiatives and investments being made in the water sector, there is still a long way to go in addressing the water scarcity crisis in the Middle East. Developing sophisticated technologies and infrastructure to improve water management, promoting water conservation measures, and encouraging regional cooperation in sharing water resources are just some of the strategies that need to be pursued in order to prevent this issue from escalating further. In conclusion, the Middle East is grappling with an immense water scarcity challenge that has driven the region to adopt alternative sources of water, such as seawater and treated wastewater, for use in district cooling and refrigeration systems. This measure aims to mitigate the demand for fresh water resources and help countries in the region deal with the constraints imposed by their arid environment. It is clear that further actions, initiatives, and sustainable solutions are needed to address this complex problem and ensure water security in the region for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis.

Q: Q: All the atoms of a given element have the same number of what in their nucleus, though they may have different numbers of neutrons? A: The answer is:","completion":"All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, though they may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms are the building blocks of all matter, and they consist of a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, which are surrounded by a cloud of electrons. Elements are defined by the number of protons they contain, which is referred to as the atomic number. This atomic number is unique for each element, meaning that no two elements can have the same number of protons. Protons are positively charged subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They are an essential aspect of determining the properties of an element, as their charge directly influences the behavior and interactions of the atom. For instance, the number of protons in an atom determines the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus, thereby impacting the element's chemical reactivity, atomic size, and the formation of chemical bonds with other atoms. While neutrons are also present in the nucleus, they do not have any charge, and their number can vary among atoms of the same element. This variation results in the formation of isotopes, which are essentially different forms of the same element with differing numbers of neutrons. Isotopes display the same chemical properties as their corresponding element, owing to the fact that their proton count remains the same. However, isotopic differences can contribute to changes in atomic mass and stability, with some isotopes exhibiting radioactive properties. In summary, all the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, which defines the characteristics and properties of that element. While the number of neutrons present in an atom of the same element may vary, their difference does not alter the fundamental chemical behavior of the element due to the proton count remaining constant."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The first question, \\"What do you think of the decision by the Indian government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes?\\" asks for a general opinion about the event and an overall analysis of its implications. This question seeks an evaluation of the action taken by the government, its context, the factors that led to the decision, and the potential positive and negative results it brought about. In response to the first question, one might detail the background leading up to the demonetization, which took place on November 8, 2016, and involved the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, declaring that all 500 and 1000-rupee banknotes would be invalid. The objective was to combat corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency while promoting a cashless economy and increased tax compliance. This decision had significant implications for the Indian economy and its citizens, with both supporters and critics. Some positive consequences of demonetization include a push towards digital transactions, tax compliance improvements, and greater transparency. On the other hand, the negative consequences include a slowdown in economic growth, long lines at banks, cash shortages, and the burden on low-income groups and rural citizens who had limited access to banking facilities. 2. The second question, \\"Was the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 notes right or is it a big scam?\\" poses a more direct and binary inquiry. In this case, the respondent is asked to take a definitive stance on the matter – either the decision was right or a scam. It assumes a potential conflict, suggesting that the demonetization could be considered fraudulent or inappropriate. This question is more likely to elicit a response that delves into the motivations behind the decision, the political environment at the time, and the possible consequences of considering it a scam. Answering the second question, it is essential to consider the factors that led to demonetization, the transparency and communication around the decision, and its impact on various stakeholders. Some critics argue that demonetization was a political move designed to hurt the opposition, while others claim that the benefits outweigh any short-term drawbacks. It is crucial to analyze the available data, reports, and studies on the issue, as well as the goals of the government and the overall context in which the decision was made, to take a definitive stance on this matter. In conclusion, while both questions focus on the Indian government's decision to demonetize 500 and 1000-rupee notes, they are not the same. The first question seeks a general understanding and assessment of the issue, while the second question calls for a more binary and definitive stance on the matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important for you to get some knowledge about first aid in your daily life. If a person has an accident, he / she needs medical care before a doctor can be found. When you give first aid, you must know three things: First, when a person stops breathing , open his / her mouth to see if there is food in his / her mouth. Second, if a person cannot breathe, try to start his / her breathing at once, using a mouth-to-mouth way. Third, if a person is hurt badly, try to stop the bleeding at once. And then take him / her to a doctor, because if a person loses one third of his / her blood, he / she may be in great danger. Many accidents may happen at home, and everyone should know some first aid to deal with common injuries. When a person _ by an animal, wash the wound with cold running water before he / she is taken to see a doctor. When a person is burnt, wash and cool the area of the skin under the cold tap for a while, then put a piece of dry clean cloth over the burn. If a person is badly burnt, take him / her to the doctor.

Sentence 2: There is no doubt that Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's break down the information in each sentence step by step. Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 content Sentence 1 states that \\"from the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as I stand here.\\" This implies that the speaker believes Mr. Inglethorp to be guilty of murder based on the evidence presented. Additionally, the speaker expresses confidence and says they'd laugh at anyone who suggested otherwise. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 content Sentence 2 simply states that \\"there is no doubt that Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife.\\" This means that the speaker seems to believe without any uncertainty that Mr. Inglethorp is guilty of murder. Step 3: Compare the content of Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 Both sentences express the same main idea: that Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife. However, Sentence 1 provides more context by referring to the evidence at the inquest, and the speaker's confidence in their belief. Sentence 2 is more straightforward and does not include this additional context. Step 4: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1 Considering the content of both sentences, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. This is because the main idea remains the same, which is the speaker's belief in Mr. Inglethorp's guilt. The additional context in Sentence 1 only serves to strengthen the certainty expressed in Sentence 2."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Palmyra (; Palmyrene: Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎ Tadmur) is an ancient Semitic city in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria. Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD. The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic), while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods. By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic. Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD.

He did not recognize the impact of the feat until after the game, when he learned that Bobby Murcer had died. Rodriguez has known of Murcer since Rodriguez’s early years in Seattle, when his manager at the time, Lou Piniella, often invoked Murcer in stories. Piniella and Murcer were teammates and friends on the Yankees, fellow outfielders in the post-Mantle era. “From what I understand, he was supposed to be the next Mickey Mantle,” Rodriguez said of Murcer. “There are no random events. I’m sure it’s a sign, somehow, the day that I pass Mantle. Bobby will be watching us. He’ll be cheering on the Yankees for all time.” Rodriguez led off the fourth inning by driving a 3-2 pitch from Brian Tallet off the left-field foul pole at the Rogers Centre. It was his 537th career home run, putting him 13th on the career list. Mike Schmidt is next, with 548. The homer was the final run of the game, which started with a flurry of scoring and ended with a string of shutout innings from Yankees relievers. Darrell Rasner (5-7) gave up four runs in the first, but he made it through five innings to earn the victory. “I was able to hang in there and get the team back in the dugout to score some runs,” Rasner said. “I tip my hat to them. They gave me a second chance.”","completion":"In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Alex Rodriguez surpassed Mickey Mantle's career home run record, hitting his 537th home run in the Yankees’ 9-4 victory.

Step 2: Research Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that states: \\"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\\" Step 3: Identify the beneficiaries The primary beneficiaries of Title IX are: 1. Women and girls: Title IX has played a significant role in promoting gender equality in education, particularly in sports and athletics. It has led to a substantial increase in the participation of women in collegiate sports, which in turn has created more opportunities for scholarships and personal development. 2. Men and boys: While Title IX is often associated with women and girls, it also protects men and boys from sex-based discrimination in educational programs and activities. This includes providing equal opportunities for male athletes in sports that have traditionally been underrepresented, such as men's volleyball, gymnastics, and swimming. 3. LGBTQ+ individuals: Title IX's prohibition of sex discrimination has been interpreted to include protection for students who are discriminated against based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. This helps ensure a safe and inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students in educational institutions that receive federal funding. 4. Pregnant and parenting students: Title IX requires schools to provide equal educational opportunities to pregnant and parenting students, ensuring that they have access to the same programs, extracurricular activities, and accommodations as other students. 5. Victims of sexual harassment and assault: Title IX obligates schools to take appropriate action to prevent, respond to, and remedy instances of sexual harassment and assault. This includes providing support services and accommodations for survivors, as well as ensuring a fair process for resolving complaints.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: where is the coldest inhabited place on earth??","completion":"The coldest inhabited place on Earth is Oymyakon, a small village located in the Sakha Republic, also known as the Republic of Yakutia, in Russia. With an extreme subarctic climate, Oymyakon is situated in the northeast region of the country, about 9,318 kilometers (5,786 miles) east of Moscow. The nearest city to Oymyakon is Yakutsk, which lies approximately 574 kilometers (357 miles) away, and the village sits 750 meters (2,460 feet) above sea level. Oymyakon gained its reputation as the coldest permanently inhabited place on Earth due to its extraordinarily low temperatures, particularly during the winter months. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the village was -67.7°C (-89.9°F) on February 6, 1933, but temperatures regularly fall below -50°C (-58°F) during winter. The harsh winter climate in Oymyakon is characterized by an extended period of polar nights, with daylight lasting for only a few hours each day. These extreme conditions are caused by Oymyakon's geographical position, as it lies deep within the Eurasian continent and is surrounded by high mountain ranges. The cold air becomes trapped in the valley, causing the temperature to plummet. Despite these extreme conditions, Oymyakon is home to around 500 residents. The people living here are primarily Yakut, which is an ethnic group with Mongolian roots, and their unique way of life has allowed them to adapt to this challenging environment. Some of the measures taken to survive in Oymyakon include having well-insulated homes with thick walls, keeping a supply of wood for heating, and ensuring that their livestock can withstand the frigid temperatures. Moreover, the local economy primarily revolves around reindeer herding, fur trade, ice-fishing, and hunting. There is also limited agriculture, mainly focused on growing winter-hardy vegetables like potatoes and carrots. Life in Oymyakon is far from easy, with everyday tasks such as keeping water pipes from freezing and vehicles operational or the extreme difficulty of burying the deceased in frozen ground requiring significant effort. However, the people of Oymyakon manage to survive thanks to their hardiness and determination. In recent times, Oymyakon has also become a destination for tourists seeking unique adventure experiences. Visitors to the village often come to witness its extreme weather firsthand, partake in traditional Yakutian activities, and gain insight into the unique lifestyle and culture of the inhabitants. In conclusion, Oymyakon is considered the coldest inhabited place on Earth, with temperatures regularly dropping below -50°C (-58°F) during the harsh winter months. Although the challenging climate and isolated location may seem like a deterrent, the resilient and adaptable people of Oymyakon prove that human life can survive and even thrive in the planet's most extreme environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are many different varieties of aquatic snail, though the most common varieties you'll encounter are the Gold Inca, mystery, nerite, pond, ramshorn, and trumpet snails. Each one is marked by its own distinct features. Which snail you choose may depend on your aesthetic preferences, your tank's needs, or both. Gold Inca snails are recognizable by their bright, yellow shells. Gold Inca snails are considered good cleaners of freshwater tanks, as they tend to consume algae and detritus. Ivory snails are identified by their cream-colored shells. Ivory snails are also considered good tank cleaners and \\"scavengers\\" of freshwater aquariums. Mystery snails have a shell that tends to vary in appearance, but is usually somewhat dark (though some are ivory), typically with brown accents or stripes. Mystery snails have a tendency to scavenge, but they can also easily escape tanks and will most likely require a secure lid. Nerite snails come in different shapes, colors, and patterns, depending on the variety of snail. Nerite snails tend to scavenge for algae, but they also burrow into the substrate at the bottom in search of food. Pond snails are one of the most frequently-encountered unwanted snails. Pond snails tend to travel on aquatic plants and in aquarium water, often inadvertently making their way home from the pet store to a new home. Ramshorn snails have a shell that appears to twist and curl, much like the horn on the head of a ram (hence the name). Ramshorn snails are good scavengers, but like pond snails they often end up in home aquariums by accident. Trumpet snails tend to have elongated and cone-shaped shells. Trumpet snails are excellent scavengers, but like pond snails and ramshorn snails, they often appear without invitation in new aquariums due to their ability to sneak in on freshwater plants. Saltwater snails are also a popular addition to many marine tanks. They tend to eat algae and plant matter just like freshwater snails do, but some snails are carnivorous. They also tend to be more colorful than their freshwater counterparts. For this reason, many aquarium enthusiasts prefer saltwater snails for their home tanks. Which snail you choose will largely depend on your personal aesthetics and your home aquarium setup. Bumble bee snails are carnivorous invertebrates. They typically eat meat-based detritus, including decomposing organisms in the tank, and have been known to eat other snails in the tank when food is scarce. Cerith snails are easy to care for and can help improve oxygenation within the substrate of an aquarium. They scavenge for algae, detritus, leftover food, and fish waste. Nassarius snails eat detritus, leftover food, decaying plant material, and fish wastes. They are excellent at keeping aquariums clean as they typically seek out a lot of food within the tank. Turbo snails are generally easy to care for and tend to be very colorful. They come in a number of varieties, including Astraea turbo snails and chestnut turbo snails, and they tend to feed on algae and dried seaweed flakes. If you're new to keeping aquatic snails, you may be uncertain about what to look for while selecting a snail. Avoid any snail that exhibits a loss of color, a lack of appetite, an inability to move/exert energy, a tendency to hide inside its shell, or visible spots or other types of fungus anywhere on the body or mouth, as these snails are most likely ill or carrying parasites. When you choose a snail, look for the following signs of good health: active movement within the water a healthy appetite for whatever type of food that snail prefers consistent/evenly-distributed coloring a clean shell It's important to be aware of the risks that come with certain varieties of aquatic snails. Some varieties are considered \\"pests,\\" appearing unexpectedly and reproducing on a large scale. These population booms can reduce oxygen content in the water, increase the levels of carbon dioxide, and create a great deal of organic waste through their excrement and eventual decomposition. When choosing aquatic snails, it's best to select snail varieties that are not generally considered pests by aquarium owners. Ramshorn snails are considered one of the biggest pest varieties. These snails reproduce quickly and in very large numbers. Pond snails and trumpet snails are also considered pests by many aquarium owners, though some owners select these snails for aesthetic reasons. Talk to an aquarium expert at your local pet store if you're not sure whether a particular variety of snail might become a pest in your tank.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To address these questions, I'll break them down into their individual parts. 1. What do Narcissists really think about? Narcissists are characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a strong need for admiration and validation, and an inability to empathize with others. To understand what narcissists think about, I will assume the perspective of a narcissist and analyze their thought process: Step 1: Focus on self: A narcissist's thoughts tend to revolve around themselves, their appearance, achievements, and status. They seek to bolster their self-esteem through positive attention from others, so they may think about how to attract praise or admiration. Step 2: Comparing with others: Narcissists often compare themselves to others and may obsess over their perceived superiority or inferiority. This could involve evaluating their talents, physical appearance, intelligence, or social standing in comparison to their peers. Step 3: Manipulating situations: Narcissists may think about ways to manipulate situations or people to serve their needs and further their self-interest. They may plan tactics for getting their way or orchestrating events to showcase their skills or qualities. Step 4: Lack of empathy: Since narcissists struggle to empathize with others, they are less likely to think about other people's feelings, needs, or perspectives. Their thoughts are predominantly centered on themselves and how they can benefit from different situations. 2. What does a narcissist think about a sociopath? To answer this question, I'll assume a narcissist's perspective and consider their opinion on a sociopath. Step 1: Assess similarities: A narcissist may recognize some similarities with a sociopath, such as manipulation, self-interest, and a lack of empathy. In this sense, they might view sociopaths as individuals who share some of their traits. Step 2: Perceive differences: Despite some similarities, a narcissist may also focus on the differences between themselves and a sociopath. Narcissists crave admiration, whereas sociopaths don't necessarily have that same drive. A narcissist may feel that their desire for admiration sets them apart from a sociopath or even makes them superior. Step 3: Competitiveness: Considering that narcissists are often competitive, they may view a sociopath as a rival or threat in scenarios where social standing, power, or control is at stake. They could feel the need to outperform or outmaneuver a sociopath to maintain their sense of accomplishment or superiority. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are not the same. The first question seeks to understand the general thought patterns and subjects that occupy a narcissist's mind. The second question specifically explores a narcissist's view of sociopaths, focusing on their evaluation of and potential relationship with another personality type. While both questions involve narcissists, they address different aspects of their thought processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dear Foursquare: This Is Not the Right Time to Sell The Social Analyst is a weekly column by Mashable Co-Editor Ben Parr, where he digs into social media trends and how they are affecting companies in the space. It’s undeniable: FoursquareFoursquare is on fire in a way that no startup since TwitterTwitter has come close to achieving. It’s changing the world and acquiring new users at a rapid place, so perhaps that’s why it doesn’t surprise us to learn that Yahoo is aggressively trying to acquire Foursquare. According to Kara Swisher of AllThingsD, Foursquare and its founder Dennis Crowley have two options: raise more money from venture capital firms that would value the company at around 100 million, or be acquired by Yahoo for 125 million or more. These are not small numbers and this is not an easy decision. The payday from Yahoo would be enough for most of the Foursquare team to be very happy for the rest of their lives. Any overtures from the Internet giant should be taken seriously. However, if Crowley and the Foursquare team want to make the kind of worldwide impact that only a handful of people can claim to have achieved — all while building a company with far greater value than the money Yahoo is offering — then it needs to take venture capital money, forgo the immediate payday and amp up Foursquare’s growth to the Facebook and Twitter level. When a hot tech start is acquired by a major technology company, the results have historically been all over the charts. For every YouTubeYouTube success (acquired by GoogleGoogle in 2006), there is a JaikuJaiku failure (acquired by Google in 2007). Sometimes the additional resources of a major tech company can help spur an acquisition to greater heights, while other times bureaucracy can leave it to languish. Unfortunately for Crowley, he’s very familiar with the latter. Crowley’s last company, DodgeballDodgeball, was in many ways the predecessor to Foursquare: It was a location-aware social network for finding interesting venues and notifying friends via text. In 2005, Google acquired Crowley’s startup. Instead of placing resources behind Dodgeball to develop its social networking capabilities, Google left it to languish in obscurity until it eventually shut down in 2009. Yahoo’s track record on acquisitions is also hit-or-miss. Since its inception, Yahoo has acquired more than 55 companies. Most of them have become the foundations of key Yahoo properties such as Yahoo Search, Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Fantasy Sports. Some, like FlickrFlickr, are running strong, while others such as Geocities, Broadcast.com and del.icio.us have either languished or been shut down. If Foursquare’s team cares about transforming the world with location-based social media — as all of our interactions with them have indicated — it should be very wary of losing its independence. Yahoo’s track record is mixed. Let’s say that Foursquare believes that Yahoo is a good fit for the company, and let’s also assume that it has talked with Yahoo about ways to assure that the same mistakes that occurred with the Google-Dodgeball acquisition don’t happen again. Is a 100 to 150 million payday a smarter deal than staying independent and taking a chance with the market? To answer that question, you have to weigh potential against chance. Is the potential growth of the company worth the risk associated with trying to go it alone with Foursquare? How big could Foursquare potentially be? Exit strategies: If Foursquare were to turn down the Yahoo offer, who would be able to buy it? Or is there legitimate potential for an IPO? These are complex issues, but if I were a betting man (and in fact, I am), I’d place my money on Foursquare being the next Twitter, rather than turning into the next FriendsterFriendster. Its growth has only been accelerating and its profile has been rising rapidly. It has the opportunity to raise enough cash to build out the team and keep building up the userbase. It has the chance to stay independent and pursue its vision for a better-connected, mobile-centric world. Here’s the real reason why I believe in Foursquare, though: it directly addresses the human need to be social in a completely useful way. Facebook and Twitter revolutionized the world because they provided easier, more efficient outlets for socializing with friends and keeping up with what they were doing. Foursquare takes it a step further by factoring in our desire to know where our friends are on top of what they are doing. Look: Foursquare is not my company, and I’d have a hard time making a decision if someone waved 125 million in my face. But if Foursquare’s passion and goal is to make location-based social networking mainstream, then it’s better off as an independent company where it can follow that vision unwaveringly. If the groundswell of grassroots support that created Foursquare Day is any indication, the company has far more potential than the figures that are being thrown out now. This is the time to put the pedal to the metal, not the time to sell.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible.

We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season.

With those kinds of odds , I ' m much better off at a craps table in Vegas . Still , I was foolhardy enough - and , like most writers , unreasonably optimistic - to think that I might creep into that glorious one percent . Why is the narrator so pessimistic at the moment ?","completion":"The narrator's current pessimism is likely a result of a combination of factors, largely tied to the difficulty and frustration associated with attempting to gain recognition and success in the world of fiction writing. Based on their statement, it appears that the rejection rate for fiction writers stands around a disheartening 99%, indicating that only one out of hundred work gets accepted. This fact alone is enough to instil a sense of pessimism, seeing the odds stacked so heavily against their favor. Moreover, with such steep odds, the narrator feels their chances would be better spent at a craps table in Vegas, a metaphor that emphasizes their disappointment and illustrates the perceived randomness and luck involved in getting a piece of-fiction accepted or recognized. It emphasizes the reality that talent and hard work does not always lead to immediate success in the literary field, and luck plays a crucial role in making a mark in this creative world. In addition, the narrator's admission of being \\"foolhardy\\" and \\"unreasonably optimistic\\" to think they might break into the successful one percent reflects the emotional exhaustion and frustration they're experiencing. This not only indicates the competitive nature of the writing industry but also their own struggle to hold onto hope in the face of continuous rejection. Writers often pour their heart and soul into their work, making each rejection personally and emotionally painful. This optimism, viewed by the narrator as \\"unreasonable\\" also speaks about the quintessential writer's paradox, which oscillates between humility and an inflated sense of self-assuredness. It highlights their initial naivety and their gradual descent into pessimism due to the harsh realities of the literary world. Finally, this pessimism may also stem from the feeling of isolation commonly experienced by writers. The process of writing can be solitary and when coupled with lack of success or recognition, it can lead to pessimistic thoughts and a decrease in self-confidence. Therefore, the narrator's pessimism could be partially explained as a coping mechanism against the harsh criticism and widespread rejection that comes in the field of writing. So, the combination of seemingly insurmountable odds, ongoing rejections, emotional exhaustion, inherent complexities of a writer's thought process and the isolating nature of the craft, all contribute to the narrator's current state of pessimism. However, it's noteworthy that despite such adversity, the narrator is still motivated and resilient enough to carry on with their pursuit, underlining their dedication towards their writing journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Hollywood's tribute to the Weather Underground This is a rush transcript from \\"Hannity,\\" March 27, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Hollywood's tribute to the Weather Underground is set for limited release in the U.S. next Friday. Left-wing actors like Robert Redford, Susan Sarandon and other stars in the movie called \\"The Company You Keep.\\" Now this is a film that effectively romanticizes this domestic terror group. Now here's how Hollywood plans on honoring the radical organization that was, of course, founded by President Obama's old pal, Bill Ayers. Watch. (BEGIN \\"THE COMPANY YOU KEEP\\" TRAILER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Former Weather Underground leader Sharon Solarz -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One of the longest fugitives on the FBI's most wanted list was arrested yesterday 30 years after the notorious Bank of Michigan robbery that resulted in the death of a guard. JACKIE EVANCHO AS \\"ISABEL GRANT\\": What's wrong? You look weird. ROBERT REDFORD AS \\"JIM GRANT/NICK SLOAN\\": I'm fine, honey. SHIA LABEOUF AS \\"BEN SHEPARD\\": I look at the man's history, the man doesn't exist before 1979. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fugitive Nicholas Sloan had been exposed by a reporter living as a lawyer named James Grant. TERRENCE HOWARD AS \\"CORNELIUS\\": Does Grant have any family? ANNA KENDRICK AS \\"DIANA\\": A daughter, 11. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are you going? LABEOUF: I don't think he's running away. I think he is trying to clear his name. SUSAN SARANDON AS \\"SHARON SOLARZ\\": Our government was murdering millions. We never betrayed each other, any of us, over all of these years. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got a full green light. SARANDON: What are you willing to take a risk for? HANNITY: Now let's remember, the horrific history of the Weather Underground. In 1970, the group planted a pipe bomb at the San Francisco Police Department, one person was killed. Also that year the NYPD was targeted with dynamite and seven injured that case. And then three Weathermen were killed while trying to assembly IEDs in New York City. In 1971 and '72, both the U.S. capitol and the Pentagon were hit, and 1981, two police officers and one Brinks guard were killed during an armed robbery orchestrated by Underground members. Sadl,y this is what Hollywood is choosing to celebrate? But I expect nothing else from people like Redford, Susan Sarandon and others. Joining me now with reaction, Fox News contributor, Michelle Malkin. I guess, you know, they're supposed to be the heroes who stand for their beliefs, is that how this plays out according to Deadline Hollywood? MICHELE MALKIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you know what an emetic is? Something that induces nausea and vomiting? Well, this trailer is a Hollywood manufactured emetic. And Robert Redford and Susan Sarandon and all of their left-wing pals who glorify those who have blood on their hands are human emetics. This is blood boiling for so many reasons, particularly because the plot of the movie, which involves a bank robbery and has rose-colored glasses about these sympathetic Weather Underground type members, I think, defiles the memory of all of the innocent victims and particularly the three who died in the real life bank robbery in the last incident that you mentioned in 1981. There were two police officers and a security guard, Peter Page, Waverly Brown, and Edward O'Grady and those names, of course, mean nothing. They're mud to the likes of these Hollywood directors and actors who, of course, will then get accolades and probably win Oscar awards for their performances. But I think what needs to happen is that the victims of all domestic terrorism and particularly Weather Underground and black liberation army which were involved in that particular bank robbery, need to show up at all of these events, on the red carpet and make these people confront the real life violence that they are glorifying. HANNITY: And then, of course, later he'll become an esteemed professor at a liberal university like University of Chicago, and then of course, you can start the political career of Barack Obama in your house and give speeches with Obama and sit on boards with Obama. I know, it's all -- we still haven't gotten an answer and it still irritates me. Let me show you the video, maybe like father like son. We've got actor Sean Penn who is known for going off on paparazzi and photographers -- here he walks in and interestingly, he didn't do anything, but then his son, 19 years old, follows up and -- watch this video. PAPARAZZI: What the hell! You (EXPLETIVE) kidding me? Don't do that. Don't ever do that, dude. PAPARAZZI: Don't do that to yourself, you're a kid -- PENN: (EXPLETIVE) you, fool! (EXPLETIVE) this fool, you're a (EXPLETIVE) ( EXPLETIVE)! PAPARAZZI: Oh, word? That's the kind of -- PAPARAZZI: That's the kind of talk you're teaching him, Sean?

The development boom in San Francisco’s downtown is proving to be an unexpected windfall for archaeologists in the bay area. Construction crews working on the City’s 1.6 billion Central Subway project recently unearthed pieces of nineteenth century industrial type sewing machines which experts believe may have been used in a basement (the machines were discovered 8 feet below the street surface) Chinatown factory – most likely destroyed in the catastrophic earthquake of 1906. Construction on the Central Subway project, which will connect Chinatown and the area south of Market with a municipal light rail line, has become a familiar sight for visitors and residents alike in the eastern neighborhoods of San Francisco in recent years. But look close enough and you’ll see something very different to most construction sites; working side by side with construction crews excavating tunnels are archaeological crews excavating for historical artifacts. California requires almost all new developments to have archaeologists as part of their team, and these above-and-beyond efforts have unearthed historical relics not seen in over a hundred years. Recently, at the Stockton Street construction site, between Washington and Jackson street, about 8 feet beneath the sidewalk and directly in front of the building housing the Chinese Americans Citizens Alliance, researchers chipped at bricks and dirt to uncover the sewing machines. Like other artifacts from other eras that have been discovered at construction sites around the city, this new discovery will contribute its own unique information about life in Chinatown and San Francisco in the late 1800’s. According to Adrian Praetzellis, with the Anthropological Studies Center at Sonoma State University, the find is unprecedented. With so little remaining of the Chinatown which existed before the 1906 earthquake, these pieces of sewing machines could very well be the last remaining remnants of the community that lived there at the turn of the century. The university is just one of six archaeological consultants the city has hired to excavate construction sites Once the historical items are removed the team of archaeologists will take the parts to their lab and work to discover who used the machines and how they came to be under a sidewalk in Chinatown for over a century. The sewing machines are a unique find given the era in which they were used and where they were found. These archaeological discoveries however, have become increasingly common due to the amount of construction work in the city. The development boom has also allowed the city to create a geographic information system (GIS) that describes and documents layers which align with a particular era. Since 2006, five layers have been defined: Chinese, maritime resources, prehistoric, the Yerba Buena period and the Spanish/Mexican period, with plans to cover other eras such as the Gold Rush period. The GIS layers are used to determine whether a construction site will require further archaeological excavation. For example, projects that propose digging to certain depths, 2 feet to 8 feet depending on the area, will automatically trigger additional studies. According to City planners, the history of San Francisco has shown that the same areas of the city are continually redeveloped and what remains underground is worth preserving. ||||| Residents and visitors of San Francisco’s eastern neighborhoods in recent years have likely witnessed the construction of the Central Subway, a 1.6 billion project that will ultimately link Chinatown and South of Market via a Muni light rail line for the first time. But amid the ubiquitous work to make way for the new Muni line by 2019, crews have also been excavating for historical artifacts as part California’s environmental requirements of most new construction in The City. While such an effort is not only mandated by state law, it’s also helping to reunite San Francisco with relics from its past not seen in over a century. ↓ Continue Reading Below [advertisement] [advertisement] At the Central Subway construction site on Stockton Street between Jackson and Washington streets Monday, beneath the sidewalk in front of what is now the Chinese Americans Citizens Alliance building, archaeologists chipped away at bricks and dirt 8 feet below the street to uncover pieces of what turned out to be 19th century industrial sewing machines. The sewing machines are believed to have been used in the basement of a Chinatown factory that likely either crumbed or burned down in the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire. Much like other artifacts from various eras uncovered during the excavation of construction sites, Monday’s discovery shed a unique light on life in Chinatown in the late 1800s. “This is unprecedented in our experience,” said Adrian Praetzellis, director of the Anthropological Studies Center at Sonoma State University. “There’s very little that remains of Chinatown prior to the [1906] earthquake, so this is basically the last remains of the earliest Chinatown.” The university is one of a half-dozen archaeological consultants hired by The City to excavate construction sites. After digging out the historical items, which will likely take several days, the Sonoma State archeology team will bring the sewing machine parts back to their lab and try to uncover the mystery of who used them and how they ended up beneath a Chinatown sidewalk. Dana Shew, an oral historian and archaeologist at Sonoma State, plans to visit the national archives in San Bruno next week to study the merchant file for the site’s former address, 1018 Stockton St. Shew said she can potentially find the names of the men and women who used the sewing machines that have been buried beneath Chinatown for over a century. While the sewing machines are a unique find for archeologists because of the era from which they were used, as well as the location where they were found, the discovery of historical objects in San Francisco is becoming increasingly common because of The City’s development boom. “We have been so busy in The City for almost the last 10 years,” said Michael Stoyka, an archeological and bone specialist at Sonoma State. “A lot of this development leads to us being here.” Archaeological studies of construction sites in The City have taken a new twist in the past decade as well with the creation of geographic information system (GIS) layers that align with a particular period of time. As of today, five layers have been developed since 2006: maritime resources, Chinese, prehistoric, the Spanish/Mexican period and the Yerba Buena period. “There are future areas we’ll cover as well, like the Gold Rush period,” said Randall Dean, the Planning Department’s only full-time archaeologist. “The game plan is to work with additional ethnic groups [to develop] new layers.” Allison Vanderslice, who splits her time between archaeology and preservation for the Planning Department, said the GIS layers are used to help determine whether a construction site requires further excavation for potential historic purposes. Projects that propose to dig to certain depths – 2 feet in some areas, 8 in others, for instance – automatically trigger sensitivity studies. Much of the development today aligns with archaeologically sensitive areas, particularly in neighborhoods like Yerba Buena, South of Market, Mission Dolores, Mission Bay and the Bayview, said Sarah Jones, The City’s director of environmental planning. “If you think about the history of San Francisco and all the things that have happened over time, it’s the same areas that keep seeing development and change over and over,” Jones said. “There’s a whole city underneath the ground that we can’t see, and we want to make sure we don’t lose that.” And as the development boom continues to adorn The City with new skyscrapers, deeper excavation occurs, potentially drumming up slivers of history. “What’s happening now is you’re having taller buildings, so our foundations are going deeper,” Vanderslice said. “You might have had multiple building episodes on one site over time, [but] what’s being built now is definitely going to take out the archaeological record as it goes down 20, 30, 40 feet sometimes.” For the Sonoma State team, beaming Monday at the discovery of the rusty sewing machine pieces, the construction boom means more opportunities to dig for history – even though, at some point, there won’t be anything left to find. “They’re not making archaeological sites anymore, so once development comes in and destroys a site it’s gone forever,” said Praetzellis, the Sonoma State professor. “At some point there’s going to be none left. With the rate of development in San Francisco, that’s not going to be far into the future.” Click here or scroll down to comment ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"During the construction of San Francisco's 1.6 billion Central Subway project, crews have discovered 19th-century industrial sewing machines, believed to have been used in a Chinatown factory destroyed during the 1906 earthquake.

In this case Cinderella (played by beautiful Jami Gertz) is a very pretty but very unsophisticated girl from New Jersey who sets out to find a Prince Charming in Manhattan. She succeeds in meeting him by accidentally wrecking his new Mercedes with her dilapidated Volkswagen. The subsequent events in their developing relationship are similarly unconventional, and even nearly disastrous. Nevertheless -- as it must in any good telling of the Cinderella story -- love wins out in the end. This movie isn't quite on a par with Pretty Woman, but it is an awful lot of fun.

A CreditCards.com analysis of how difficult or easy it is for the average American to read and understand a credit card agreement shows some of the worst contracts have improved somewhat in the past few months but are still too complex for the average consumer. READABILITY FOLLOW-UP In a follow-up to its July 2010 credit card agreement readability study, CreditCards.com looked at the 20 most difficult to read and the 20 wordiest contracts to see if any had improved between July and October. Only six of the 20 most difficult-to-read contracts showed improvement. Nine of the 20 had the same reading level, three were more difficult to read and two were no longer offered by the credit card issuer. All were still rated at the 12th grade reading level or higher -- too difficult for four out of five adults to understand. That's the key finding of a CreditCards.com follow-up to our July 2010 analysis of the readability of all major U.S. credit card agreements . For this follow-up, we looked again at the worst offenders -- the ones we had identified in July as most difficult to read and the wordiest contracts. The goal: to see if the most recent of the contracts submitted to the Federal Reserve each quarter were any more readable than the first batch. (See methodology .) Under the Credit CARD Act of 2009, major credit card issuers in the United States are required to submit copies of their credit card agreements to the Fed, which must post them to the Web. The July analysis found that the initial contracts submitted to the Fed required a 12th grade reading level on average to understand. The average American adult in the United States reads at only the ninth grade level. Although consumer credit counselors advise cardholders to be sure to read and know the terms of their credit cards, four out of five adults don't read well enough to understand the average credit card agreement. In the follow-up analysis, many of the worst agreements showed improvement -- meaning new contracts submitted to the Fed and analyzed with the same readability software programs were slightly better than earlier versions of the contracts. However, all were still tough reading for average adults. \\"The reason these agreements are typically complex is that they have lots of hidden fees and traps,\\" says Josh Frank, a senior researcher for the Center for Responsible Lending, a North Carolina-based consumer group. \\"What's in the complexity can cause the consumer problems ... can do them financial harm.\\" Safer credit cards The National Consumer Law Center identified simple terms and clear disclosure as one of the top 11 features of a \\"safer credit card\\" in a report issued Nov. 18, 2010. \\"The terms must be simple enough and disclosed clearly enough that they are likely to be noticed and understood by the vast majority of cardholders,\\" according to the report. Consumer groups are hoping that the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- currently being organized by former Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren in the U.S. Treasury Department -- will make clarity and simple credit card terms one of its first tasks. However, the agency won't likely be up and fully functioning until late 2011. So, consumers shouldn't expect to be able to speed read through their credit card agreements any time soon. The reason these agreements are typically complex is that they have lots of hidden fees and traps. -- Josh Frank Center for Responsible Lending \\"Elizabeth Warren is putting a focus on complexity in card agreements,\\" Frank said. \\"I expect that there will be some change there, but it's hard to say how soon. I would expect it in the long term.\\" Frank conducted a different kind of analysis of credit card terms, but came to the same conclusion about complexity. \\"Numbers Game,\\" published in October 2010, analyzed the total number of numeric figures contained in typical credit card offers as a measure of the complexity of the deals. They found that between 1999 and 2009, the complexity of terms offered in the Schumer Box -- a table that summarizes terms of the credit card offer -- rose by 250 percent. However, the complexity began to decline in 2010 after the bulk of the CARD Act reform provisions took effect. Frank said the days of hidden fees and terms aren't likely over. \\"In the long term, I think there will be other tricks to look for,\\" he said. Language doesn't matter? Nick Bourke, director of the Pew Safe Credit Cards Project, which is conducting ongoing research and monitoring card industry practices, acknowledged that the new credit card reform law has benefited consumers by preventing credit card issuers from hiking interest rates \\"at any time for any reason.\\" \\"Even if the language is still complicated, what's behind the language is a little bit more straightforward,\\" he said. If agreements are written in simple language, that doesn't guarantee that the terms are fair, Bourke said. \\"If they say, 'We will credit your incoming payments in a way that is suitable to the banks,' those are pretty simple words.\\" Previously, banks and credit unions would put monthly payments toward balances with the lowest interest first. This meant consumers paid more in interest on balances with higher rates. That practice, known as payment allocation, is now banned by the CARD Act. Credit card issuers must now apply any amounts in excess of the minimum monthly payment to balances with the highest interest rates first. Bourke said the language in the credit card agreement \\"has become a little less important because the products themselves are a little safer. A lot of that old language was masking practices that were difficult to understand and harmful.\\" Worst contracts haven't gotten much better CreditCards.com reviewed the 20 most difficult reads and 20 wordiest contracts from July and compared them with contracts for the same cards published by the Fed in the third quarter of 2010. Six of the 20 most difficult-to-read contracts showed improvement; nine of the 20 were rated the same readability level as previous versions -- often because they were the same contract. Only three contracts were worse. Two of the 20 agreements were no longer listed in the Fed's database, an indication that the credit cards were no longer offered by the issuer. A GTE Federal Credit Union agreement topped the list of the most difficult to read contracts in July. That agreement required 18.5 years of education to understand. The lender swapped that agreement out for another contract that was rated 16.2 years -- a 12 percent improvement, but still very high. A Compass Bank agreement that ranked fourth on the list of unreadable contracts got a makeover. According to Ed Bilek, senior vice president and director of external communications for BBVA Compass Bank, which owns Compass, it was no accident that the same contract given a 17.5 reading level in the first analysis scored only 12.7 in the follow-up review. \\"It was deliberate,\\" Bilek said, adding the company began re-tooling its contracts in 2009 after passage of the CARD Act. He acknowledged that the 12.7 grade level rating is \\"still too high\\" and said the bank is continuing its efforts to simplify terms for its customers. The re-writing that began in 2009 continued in 2010 with further tweaking of language. \\"Part of that was redoing our disclosure in our credit card agreement with the idea in mind that we tried to make it much easier to read and understand,\\" Bilek said. \\"The two traits that we believe should be in every product are transparency and simplicity.\\" He added: \\"We talk to our customers quite a bit about our products. We ask them, 'You read it. Did you understand it? Is it easy?'\\" More brevity There was clear evidence of editing for brevity on several of the wordiest contracts. Among the 20 wordiest agreements from July, three out of four (15 contracts) had been shortened, according to the readability software program. The average agreement analyzed in July ran 3,771 words. A contract for Fifth Third Bank topped the list of wordiest among the more than 1,200 agreements reviewed in July. The program determined that contract had 20,799 words spread over 19 pages. The updated agreement was more spartan, however. It contained only 14,406 words in 15 pages. Both old and new agreements required 15 years reading level. Note: Because the software program deletes words that are contained in headlines, bulleted lists and subtitles, the actual number of words in the agreement are higher. For comparison, the original U.S. Constitution contains only 4,018 words. William Shakespeare's shortest play, \\"The Comedy of Errors,\\" has 17,858 words. ... We tried to make it easier to read and understand. -- Ed Bilek BBVA Compass Bank spokesman A GE Money Bank retail credit card for Dick's Sporting Goods stores got a major rewrite. It dropped from 11,000 to about 2,000 words -- and from a college reading level (15 years) to a ninth grade reading level, according to the analysis. Similarly, a BrandsMart department store retail card, also issued by GE Money Bank, underwent a dramatic improvement between the first and second analysis. Previously, the agreement contained more than 11,000 words and required 15 years of education to read. The new version contained 1,900 words written at the ninth grade reading level. Banking industry representatives say contracts are written the way they are because federal and state banking laws require them to make certain disclosures about the cards. They deny that the agreements are deliberately written to confuse consumers. Some banks and credit unions, however, do manage to satisfy legal requirements without dense language. In our July analysis, we identified the 10 easiest-to-read contracts. All were from credit unions. They were written at less than a seventh grade level. Experts say most credit card holders don't bother reading their entire contracts. It's no wonder -- the documents are tough reading even for consumer attorneys and people with advanced degrees. Frank, the responsible-lending group researcher, who has a doctorate degree, said he struggles through some passages in the documents: \\"I have to focus to really understand it.\\" Lenders are required to send the agreements when new credit card accounts are opened or if a consumer requests a copy of their contract. See how to get your credit card agreement . Frank said the issue is whether the densely worded fine print in the credit card agreement is fair to consumers. \\"It's supposed to be an agreement between two parties,\\" he said. \\"If it's too complex for one party to ever read or understand, then is it really an agreement as opposed to something that's imposed on you?\\" The methodology: How we did it CreditCards.com copied the list of more than 1,200 credit card agreements posted on the Federal Reserve Board's website. Under the Credit CARD Act of 2009, all U.S. credit card issuers with more than 10,000 credit card accounts must submit their agreements to the Fed every quarter as well as post them on their own company websites and make them available to account holders who request them. The Fed launched the site on May 24, 2010, with the initial list of credit card contracts. The site was updated in October 2010. New contracts were added and some deleted from the list, while others remained unchanged. Every credit card agreement posted on the Fed's website as of May 24, 2010, was evaluated by two readability programs that were purchased from Micro Power & Light Co., a Dallas software development company. The first program prepped the content by deleting special characters, incomplete sentences, tables and any special coding that may have been in the text versions of the files. The second program scored the text using three different well-established readability formulas: the Flesch reading ease, Flesch-Kincaid grade level and FOG (Frequency of Gobbledygook) indexes. Only one of the formulas, the widely used FOG score, was used in determining the best and worst credit card agreements and average reading level of a U.S. credit card agreement. We removed Spanish contracts that were included in the Fed's database. In some instances, credit card issuers included both Spanish and English text in their contracts. We deleted any Spanish text and ran the readability formulas on the remaining English content. Some files posted on the Fed's website were not credit card agreements but rather supplemental materials that often accompany agreements, such as tables listing interest and penalty rates and fees or information about credit card or disability insurance. In some instances, they were credit card applications. Those files were not scored for readability. A small number of contracts were not evaluated for readability because the text versions of the agreements were either empty or did not reflect what was actually in the agreement. Because the computer program that prepped the contracts removed headlines, incomplete sentences and special characters, it also removed words from credit card agreements. Therefore, the total word count reflected in the results is less than the word count derived by putting the contracts into a word processing program. In the second analysis, conducted in October and November 2010, we looked at the worst contracts (the 20 most difficult to read and the 20 wordiest) from the original filings and compared them to agreements for the same card products posted in the second batch of filings to the Fed's website.

(If you don’t want to listen to the hour-long retraction, which is a masterpiece of the form, the transcript is available here.) Daisey has attempted to defend his actions, using an end-justifies-the-means argument: What I do is not journalism. The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism. For this reason, I regret that I allowed THIS AMERICAN LIFE to air an excerpt from my monologue. THIS AMERICAN LIFE is essentially a journalistic ­- not a theatrical ­- enterprise, and as such it operates under a different set of rules and expectations. But this is my only regret. I am proud that my work seems to have sparked a growing storm of attention and concern over the often appalling conditions under which many of the high-tech products we love so much are assembled in China. Kevin Slavin has defended Daisey, too: His skill in telling the story he told is responsible for the phenomenal amount of media around Chinese factory labor practices. Not the New York Times’ China bureau. Not Bloomberg Businessweek. Show me some reporters who were able to generate the same cultural engagement with the issue, will you? Stories aren’t made out of facts. Storytellers use facts to reveal truth but they use a lot of other things too. And if ever I have to choose between facts and truth, I’ll take truth. It’s always a great story, and stories are the life inside the human mind. It’s a lot easier to tell a great story if you don’t also need to be factual about things. Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet are fiction; Richard III and Henry V are mostly fiction, albeit based on historical events. And it’s precisely because they’re fictional — because Shakespeare was always storyteller first and foremost — that they’re still performed so regularly, all over the world, and that they have had such powerful emotional resonance with billions of people over the centuries since they were written. But here’s the thing: Shakespeare never lied. He never sat down in front of thousands of people to tell a first-person story, over and over again, about events which he had simply invented. He never ended that story with an exhortation which would carry no weight if his audience thought the story was fiction: When Apple would call journalists who had spoken to me, and tell them, “You know, I don’t know if you want to be associated with him. He’s kind of unstable. You know, he does work in the theater.” I would keep my head down. And I would tell my story. And tonight—we know the truth. At the end of Daisey’s show, every member of the audience is given a sheet of paper with the heading “CHANGE IS POSSIBLE”. It includes Tim Cook’s email address, and urges the audience to, among other things, “think different about upgrading”. And one of the reasons why Daisey’s show has proved so popular — his This American Life episode was the most downloaded in the show’s history, even more than the squirrel cop — is that it combined great storytelling with a feeling that this is happening now and we should do something about it. It’s exactly the same formula used by Kony 2012, a project which is equally problematic. My friend and Reuters colleague Rebecca Hamilton has written a great book, Fighting for Darfur, which should be required reading for anybody who has been drawn in by the Kony 2012 campaign. Or, for that matter, by Daisey’s monologue. Here’s what she wrote to me: To build a mass movement quickly, it helps to have an over-simplified, emotive narrative with a single demand. It also helps to tells people that by doing easy tasks – sharing a link on Facebook, buying a bracelet — they can save lives. Central to the formula is that the agency of local actors gets downplayed to hype up the importance of action by outsiders. But all those ingredients inevitably lead to eventual failure when the simple solutions can’t fix the complex reality. The movement walks away, disillusioned. And in the meantime untold resources have been expended on solutions that have been out of step with what local activists need. The fact is that the chief beneficiary of the success of Daisey’s monologue has been Mike Daisey, much more than any group of factory workers or underground trades unionists in China. Similarly, the chief beneficiary of the success of Kony 2012 has been Invisible Children, a US non-profit which spends its money mostly on making movies. And this is where the justifications coming from Daisey and Slavin really fall down — in the idea that if you get a lot of westerners riled up about what’s going on in some far-flung part of the world, then that is in and of itself a Good Thing. Daisey has managed to convince himself that his interests are perfectly aligned with those of the workers at Foxconn. Even when he presents himself as some kind of savior in a Hawaiian shirt, bringing wisdom to the workers just by asking the right questions: I’m just ad-hoc-ing questions, I’m asking the questions you would expect: “What village in China are you from? How long have you been working at Foxconn? What do you do at the plant? How do you find your job? What would you change at Foxconn if you could change anything?” That last question always gets them. They always react like a bee has flown into their faces and then they say something to Cathy and Cathy says, “He says he never thought of that before.” Every time. Every time. Of course it’s ludicrous to believe that someone working 12-hour shifts at a Foxconn plant wouldn’t start thinking about how the plant might be better run. But that’s the power of theater: its conventions are designed to encourage us to suspend such disbelief. And so we walk away thinking that Mike Daisey is bold and wonderful, and really did ask that question of Foxconn workers under the glare of gun-toting Chinese guards. (Of course, we now know that no Foxconn guards are armed: that bit, too, was made up.) And we think that the Chinese workers are so beaten-down and resigned to their miserable fate that they never even stop to think about how things might be improved. And this is why I believe the story of Shin In Geun, despite the fact that its format is inherently treacherous. Both Shin and Harden have every incentive to exaggerate and to make things seem worse than they are; what’s more, there’s absolutely no way of fact-checking the vast majority of what’s in the story. But what’s missing from their tale is the white man’s burden: the idea that a white American like Mike Daisey or Jason Russell (or Jeff Sachs, for that matter) is a selfless hero, doing good for the poor and exploited in other continents. What Daisey should have done is what Dave Eggers did when he wrote What is the What: make no pretense that everything is true, and trust in the power of his storytelling to carry the audience along. Instead, he lied — both to This American Life and to his audience. I am telling you that I do not speak Mandarin, I do not speak Cantonese, I have only a passing familiarity with Chinese culture and to call what I have a passing familiarity is an insult to Chinese culture—I don’t know fuck-all about Chinese culture. But I do know that in my first two hours of my first day at that gate, I met workers who were fourteen years old, I met workers who were thirteen years old, I met workers who were twelve. Do you really think Apple doesn’t know? This had a lot of resonance for me, when I first heard it, not least because I understand statistics. In order to meet underage workers who are happy to talk about how old they are within two hours of turning up at a factory gate, there need to be a lot of those workers. Many more than the official numbers suggest. But in fact Daisey did not meet underage workers outside the factory gates. (He still claims that he did, but his translator, who’s a much more reliable source, says that he didn’t. And as Evan Osnos says, that whole episode defies credulity in the first place.) Daisey’s m.o., it’s now clear, was to go to China, talk to some people, and then write a monologue in which he felt free to incorporate anything he’d read about the plight of workers anywhere in the country, presented as a direct piece of first-person reportage. And there’s a good reason why that’s an underhanded and unethical thing to do, which is that even if Apple did everything Daisey’s asking of them, he could still go to China and return with the exact same monologue. With hindsight, Apple was absolutely right not to engage with Daisey directly, because he created a game they could never win. The only winning move, for them, was not to play. Jack Shafer, then, is right to come down hard on Daisey. He concludes with this, about fabulists generally: I have my theory: 1) They lie because they don’t have the time or talent to tell the truth, 2) they lie because think they can get away with it, and 3) they lie because they have no respect for the audience they claim to want to enlighten. That would be an ideal subject for a one-man theatrical performance. The irony is that this subject has already been explored in a one-man theatrical performance — one by Mike Daisey, no less. Daisey, you won’t be surprised to hear, is gentler on James Frey and JT Leroy than Shafer is on Daisey, blaming in significant part “the demands of personal storytelling” for their sins. In any case, it’s clear that theatrical events are bad places to look for unvarnished truth. And in the set of “theatrical events” I absolutely include things like TED talks. Many people have asked, of the hilarious TED 2012 autotune remix, whether it’s parody or not. The answer is that it’s not parody at all. Rather, it’s the work of someone who has been entranced by TED’s theater, and who hasn’t yet woken up to realize that statements like “we can change the world if we defy the impossible” are less stirring than they are just plain stupid. Real life is messy. And as a general rule, the more theatrical the story you hear, and the more it divides the world into goodies vs baddies, the less reliable that story is going to be. I’ll be very interested to read Harden’s book about Shin In Geun, to see how the guards and teachers in the prison camp are portrayed — to see whether they’re monsters or whether they themselves are victims of the North Korean regime. As we know from Primo Levi, prison camps will twist and subvert the ethics of all concerned. And even in this excerpt we can see real moral problems: Shin himself behaves with astonishing heartlessness towards his own parents and brother. One of the central problems with narrative nonfiction is that the best narratives aren’t messy and complicated, while nonfiction nearly always is. Daisey stepped way too far over the line when he started outright lying to his audience and to the producers of This American Life. But all of us in the narrative-nonfiction business (I’ve written such stuff myself) are faced at some point with a choice between telling the story and telling the whole truth, or the whole truth as best we understand it. Someone like Michael Lewis will concentrate with a laser focus on the story: what he writes is the truth, but it isn’t the whole truth. And when you have a storyteller like Mike Daisey who considers himself a monologist rather than a journalist, even outright lies can find their way in to the story very easily. Ira Glass says that This American Life should have scrapped the idea of doing a Mike Daisey show the minute he told their fact-checkers that he had no way of contacting his translator. But maybe the mistake was made even earlier, when This American Life decided that a theatrical monologue could ever be held to standards of journalistic accuracy. This one certainly couldn’t, and in that I think it’s more the rule than the exception. ||||| Summary:","completion":"This article talks about how credit card agreements are still too difficult for most people to read and understand.

The design, operation and maintenance is usually done by government, typically on the local level, but may occasionally be contracted out to a private sector company. - The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A) was an American railroad of central Maryland and Washington, D.C., built in the 19th and 20th century. The WB&A absorbed two older railroads, the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad and the Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line, and added its own electric streetcar line between Baltimore and Washington. It was built by a group of Cleveland, Ohio, electric railway entrepreneurs to serve as a high-speed, showpiece line using the most advanced technology of the time. It served Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis, Maryland, for 27 years before the Great Depression and the rise of the automobile forced an end to passenger service in 1935. Only the Baltimore & Annapolis portion continued to operate. Today, parts of the right-of-way are used for light rail, rail trails and roads. - The Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad was an American railroad of central Maryland built in the 19th century. The railroad, the second to serve Annapolis, ran between Annapolis and Clifford along the north shore of the Severn River. From Clifford, just north of the present day Patapsco Light Rail Stop, it connected with the B&O's Curtis Bay branch so that trains could travel to Baltimore. In 1921, when it was called the Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line, it was purchased by the larger Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A), and then emerged from the WB&A's 1935 bankruptcy and closure as the Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad. B&A electric passenger operation between the two cities continued until 1950, at which time the rail line became solely a freight carrier, operating buses for passenger service. Freight service to Annapolis continued until June 1968 when the Severn River Trestle was declared unsafe. In the 1980s the line was completely shut down. The right-of-way now serves as part of Baltimore's light rail system and as the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail. - The Jones Falls is a stream in Maryland. It is impounded to create Lake Roland before running through the city of Baltimore and finally emptying into the Baltimore Inner Harbor. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east.

A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Druid Hill Park is a urban park in northwest Baltimore, Maryland. Its boundaries are marked by Druid Park Drive (north), Swann Drive and Reisterstown Road (west and south), and the Jones Falls Expressway (east). Inaugurated in 1860, Druid Hill Park, a famed urban park, ranks with Central Park (begun in 1858) in New York City and Fairmount Park (1812) in Philadelphia as the oldest landscaped public parks in the United States. - Light rail, light rail transit (LRT) or fast tram is urban public transport using rolling stock similar to a tramway, but operating at a higher capacity, and often on an exclusive right-of-way. - The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture. The system has many connections to other transit agencies of Central Maryland, Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and south-central Pennsylvania (Hanover, Harrisburg, and York): WMATA, Charm City Circulator, Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland, Annapolis Transit, Rabbit Transit, Ride-On, and TransIT. - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. - The Baltimore Light Rail is a light rail system serving Baltimore, Maryland, United States, as well as its surrounding suburbs. It is operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA Maryland). In downtown Baltimore, it uses city streets. Outside the central portions of the city, the line is built on private rights-of-way, mostly from the defunct Northern Central Railway, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad and Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. The line is sometimes referred to the \\"Blue Line\\", or less commonly as the \\"Central Light Rail Line\\", even though the line carries three different routes on the same system: Hunt Valley-BWI (Blue), Hunt Valley-Cromwell (Yellow), and Penn Station-Camden Yards (Red). - The Northern Central Railway (NCRY) was a Class I Railroad connecting Baltimore, Maryland with Sunbury, Pennsylvania, along the Susquehanna River. Completed in 1858, the line came under the control of the later Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1861, when the PRR acquired a controlling interest in the Northern Central's stock to compete with the rival Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). For eleven decades the Northern Central operated as a subsidiary of the PRR until much of its Maryland trackage was washed out by Hurricane Agnes in 1972; after which most of its operations ceased as the Penn Central declined to repair sections. It is now a fallen flag railway, having come under the control of the later Penn Central (merger of the PRR and the New York Central), Conrail, and then broken apart and disestablished. The southern part in Pennsylvania is now the York County Heritage Rail Trail which connects to a similar hike/bike trail in Northern Maryland down to Baltimore, named the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail. Only the trackage around Baltimore remains in rail service. - Central Park is an urban park in Manhattan, New York City. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with 40 million visitors in 2013, and one of the most filmed locations in the world.

Bacteria: Acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacteria, are resistant to decolorization by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria, is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or acid-fast stain, in which the acid-fast bacilli are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background. L-form bacteria are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls. The main pathogenic bacteria in this class is Mycoplasma (not to be confused with Mycobacteria).

(CNN) -- Susan Denise Atkins, a former member of the Manson family who killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate during a two-day killing spree in 1969, has died, according to a California corrections spokesman. She was 61. Susan Atkins, here with husband James Whitehouse, died Thursday night after a battle with brain cancer. Atkins died at 11:46 p.m. PT Thursday (2:46 a.m. Friday ET) at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, said Terry Thornton with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins, California's longest-serving female inmate, was suffering from terminal brain cancer. Since she entered prison in 1971, she became a born-again Christian who worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children, among others, according to a Web site maintained by her attorney and husband, James Whitehouse. But Atkins was best known for her actions in 1969 when as a 21-year-old she and other Manson family members participated in seven murders over two days, a rampage that terrorized Los Angeles. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate, who was the eight months' pregnant, down as the 26-year-old actress pleaded for mercy, stabbing her 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \\"asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\\" After stabbing Tate to death, Atkins -- known in the family as Sadie Mae Glutz -- scrawled the word \\"pig\\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski, according to historical accounts of the murders. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's houseguests -- Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring and Voytek Frykowski -- were killed. Also slain was teenager Steven Parent, who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back. All of those involved -- Manson, Atkins, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson -- were convicted in connection with the five deaths that night and the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. They were all sentenced to death. But their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972. Atkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, 2008, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7. In July 2008, Atkins requested a \\"compassionate release\\" from the California Board of Parole Hearings. It was denied by unanimous decision. Her request was opposed by Tate's sister, Debra, Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. On September 2, a panel from the Board of Parole Hearings denied Atkins' suitability for parole in a hearing, her 13th. Atkins' hospital bed was wheeled into the hearing room for the proceeding, and she appeared to sleep through much of it. For her statement, her husband helped her deliver the 23rd Psalm. She spoke in a high, cracked voice. During the roughly six-hour-long hearing, Debra Tate asked the board commissioners not to free Atkins. \\"There has never been any hate in my heart for these people,\\" she said. \\"I am incapable of hating. I commend them -- always have commended them -- for their good deeds that they have managed to accomplish within the walls of confinement. However, I do believe that the death of my sister, my nephew -- which would be turning 40 years old right now, this week -- is not an irrelevant cause.\\" Atkins was described as a model prisoner who accepted responsibility for her crime, but Tate said Atkins had never offered her an apology. Sebring's nephew, Anthony DiMaria, also spoke at the parole suitability hearing. \\"I feel genuine compassion for Ms. Atkins as she deals with this disease,\\" he told parole commissioners, \\"but in no way should an illness dealt by fate mitigate punishment for crimes of this magnitude.\\" Atkins was housed in the California Institution for Women at Frontera until May 2008 when her declining health prompted a move to Central California Women's Facility. On his Web site, Whitehouse wrote that as of spring 2009, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair. Like most of the other former Manson family members, Atkins shunned Manson during her incarceration. \\"He is a liar, a con artist, a physical abuser of women and children, a psychological and emotional abuser of human beings, a thief, a dope pusher, a kidnaper, a child stealer, a pimp, a rapist and a child molester,\\" she wrote in a manuscript posted on her Web site. \\"I can attest to all of these things with my own eyes. And he was all of these things before he was a murderer.\\" Atkins gave birth to a son while living at Spahn Ranch, an old movie set, with other members of the Manson family. While she was on death row, she wrote, he was legally taken from her because no one in her family was willing to raise him. \\"His name and identity have been changed and sealed, so I have no idea where he is or how he is doing,\\" she wrote. \\"I have since been told his name was changed to Paul, and whether or not that is true I like it. ... My continuing separation from my son, even after all these years, remains an incredibly poignant and enduring loss.\\" Ironically, Sharon Tate planned to name her unborn son Paul. The gravestone bears the inscription Paul Richard Polanski. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Susan Denise Atkins was a member of the Manson family, a group of people led by Charles Manson.

Possible answers: felt angry, felt happy, felt cold A:","completion":"Considering the context provided, it can be inferred that Kai would most likely feel happy after walking back from school and enjoying his freedom and the warm spring air. Here's a detailed analysis of the situation and the reasons for each of the emotions: 1. Kai's feeling of freedom: The fact that Kai is walking back from school suggests that he is glad to have finished his classes or education-related responsibilities for the day. This feeling of relief from the academic pressures and routine can be a significant contributing factor to his happiness. The freedom to enjoy the rest of the day on his own terms can be a liberating emotion, leading to a sense of satisfaction and joy. 2. The warm spring air: The setting plays an essential part in gauging Kai's emotions, as the warm spring air is generally perceived as pleasant and enjoyable. The spring season, with its mild temperatures, is welcoming and represents new beginnings, personal growth, and rejuvenation. Being surrounded by nature's beauty during this season can instill a sense of calm and happiness in most individuals, making it likely that Kai feels happy in this situation. 3. Physical activity and its impact on mood: Walking is known to release endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. It's possible that the physical activity of walking back from school can contribute positively to Kai's emotional well-being and happiness. However, to provide a thorough analysis, let's consider the other possible emotional outcomes: Felt angry - It's unlikely that Kai would feel angry in this situation, as everything mentioned seems to be positive and enjoyable. The freedom, warm spring air, and physical activity all contribute to a positive mood rather than inciting anger. Felt cold - Although the context suggests that it's spring and the air is warm, it is still possible to feel a bit chilly in the shade or when the wind picks up. However, since you mentioned that Kai is enjoying the warm spring air, it is safe to assume Kai is feeling comfortable in the prevalent weather conditions. Based on the information provided and the reasons outlined above, it can be concluded that Kai most likely felt happy as he walked back from school, enjoying his freedom and the warm spring air."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. Question: \\"What kept the U.S. government from being able to stop Bin Laden's flow of money?\\" Answer: \\"They couldn't find any information\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer \\"They couldn't find any information\\" is not entirely correct. A more accurate and detailed answer would be as follows: The U.S. government faced multiple challenges in stopping Bin Laden's flow of money. First of all, they discovered that Bin Laden was not personally funding al-Qaeda, which forced them to reevaluate their approach and focus on other sources of funding such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. However, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions amidst the vast sums moving in the international financial system, making it hard for the CIA to find or disrupt their money flows. The suggested creation of an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center could not gain necessary resources from the Treasury and CIA. Domestically, while the FBI had knowledge about extremist organizations connected to al-Qaeda operating within the United States, they failed to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda's fundraising. Additionally, Treasury regulators and U.S. financial institutions focused predominantly on money laundering related to drug trafficking and high-level international fraud, considering terrorist financing to be of lower importance."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years later. Joe Frady, writing for a Portland, Oregon newspaper, sets himself up to get arrested to get a story on a major drug bust. Frady is bailed out of jail by his boss and editor Bill Rintels (Hume Cronyn) who always complains that Frady is trying to create news rather than reporting it. Shortly thereafter, Frady is visited by Lee Carter (Paula Prentiss), a Seattle newscaster and his former girlfriend, who tells them that she fears for her life. Lee tells Frady that someone is trying to kill her and that six other reporters at the luncheon have all died mysteriously during the past two years. Frady shrugs her off by telling her that she's just being paranoid. But a few days later, Lee is found dead in her apartment.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a great director at the helm","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"a great director at the helm,\\" can be considered positive. This is due to several components within the sentence that contribute to building a favorable impression. Firstly, the word \\"great\\" serves as a strong, affirmative descriptor that positively evaluates the director. The adjective conveys excellence, skill, and effectiveness in the director's work or abilities. It signifies that the person holds an outstanding position in their field, surpassing average or mediocre levels of performance. Secondly, the inclusive phrase \\"at the helm\\" speaks to the director's leading role in any creative endeavor or project. This implies that the director has a significant amount of responsibility and authority in their occupation. So, the positive regard for the director can influence the overall perception of the project or team under their leadership. Using this expression also shows trust and confidence placed in the director's judgment and decision-making abilities during the project or creative endeavor. Thus, from the choice of adjective and the overall message the sentence conveys, it is clear that the sentiment leans heavily toward the positive end of the spectrum. Followers of the director's work, or those intrigued by any projects helmed by the described director, would most likely feel reassured and optimistic knowing that there is a skilled and capable individual leading the way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name \\"England\\". The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global \\"lingua franca\\". Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - Karl Julius Ploetz ( 8 July 1819 -- 6 February 1881 ) was a German author of scholarly works , most notably his Epitome of History published in the English language in 1883 . Ploetz was born in Berlin . He is credited with the idea of arranging historic data by dates , geographic location , and other factors . As later used in the English language , Encyclopedia of World History credited with being one of the most complete and comprehensive academic tools available before the electronic revolution . His work was a compilation of factual world events designed to help the students and the general reader . The first English translation was in the U.S. in 1883 by William H. Tillinghast and published by Houghton Mifflin Company . The name of the original work ( in a form of a handbook ) was Auszug aus der alten , mittleren und neueren Geschichte . Karl Ploetz died in Görlitz in 1881 . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt. - Frisia or Friesland is a coastal region along the southeastern corner of the North Sea in what today is mostly a large part of the Netherlands, including modern Friesland, and smaller parts of Germany. Frisia is the traditional homeland of the Frisians, a Germanic people that speaks Frisian languages, which together with English form the Anglo-Frisian language group. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - The Frisian languages are a closely related group of Germanic languages, spoken by about 500,000 Frisian people, who live on the southern fringes of the North Sea in the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. The Frisian languages is the closest living language group to English languages, and are together grouped into the Anglo-Frisian languages. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to foreign influences. The three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch, Danish, and/or Low German, depending upon their location. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the Great Yarmouth area, Friesland, and Denmark are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how do electric stoves boil water?\\" is \\"burning\\", given that electric stoves boil water?","completion":"No, I do not think that the right answer to the question \\"how do electric stoves boil water?\\" is \\"burning.\\" Electric stoves work on a different principle than traditional gas stoves, which may involve an open flame. To better understand how electric stoves boil water, let's explore how they function and the processes involved in boiling water. Electric stoves work by converting electrical energy into heat energy. They typically consist of coiled heating elements made of a resistance wire enclosed in an insulating sheath, usually covered by a glass-ceramic surface. When an electric current passes through the resistance wire, it encounters resistance, which results in the production of heat. As a result, the energy provided through the electrical outlet is converted into heat energy that heats the coil. When you place a pot or kettle with water on the electric stove, the heat generated by the heating element is transferred to the pot, and then to the water inside the pot. As the water absorbs the heat, its temperature rises. At a certain point, the water molecules acquire enough energy to break free from the attractive forces holding them together in the liquid state. This transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase is what we call boiling. On the other hand, the term \\"burning\\" typically implies an exothermic reaction involving the rapid combination of a substance with oxygen, producing heat, light, and often flames. It usually refers to a process called combustion. For example, when wood or coal is burned, the carbon-based compounds combine with oxygen to create carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of heat and light. In conclusion, describing the method by which electric stoves boil water as \\"burning\\" is not accurate. Instead, electric stoves rely on resistance heating to generate the necessary heat for boiling water. To properly answer the question: An electric stove boils water by using electrical energy to generate heat through a resistance heating element, transferring the heat to the pot, and ultimately increasing the temperature of the water until it reaches the boiling point and begins to evaporate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Hundred Years' War, the army of the Duke of Burgundy and a force of about two hundred English soldiers occupied Paris from May 1420 until 1436. They repelled an attempt by Joan of Arc to liberate the city in 1429. A century later, during the French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League. On 24 August 1572, Paris was the site of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, when thousands of French Protestants were killed. The last of these wars, the eighth one, ended in 1594, after Henri IV had converted to Catholicism and was finally able to enter Paris as he supposedly declared Paris vaut bien une messe (\\"Paris is well worth a Mass\\"). The city had been neglected for decades; by the time of his assassination in 1610, Henry IV had rebuilt the Pont Neuf, the first Paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings, linked with a new wing the Louvre to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges.

Answer:","completion":"In \\"The Planets Suite\\" by Gustav Holst, the planet that is often referred to as the \\"bringer of jollity\\" is Jupiter. Officially titled \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity,\\" this is the fourth movement of Holst's renowned seven-movement orchestral suite, which was written between 1914 and 1916. Each movement of the suite is characterized by the composer's interpretation of what he believed to be the astrological and mythological associations with the seven planets in our solar system at the time (excluding Earth and Pluto, the latter of which was not yet discovered). The 'Planets Suite' explores the influence of these celestial bodies on the human psyche and each movement reflects the planet's astrological character, as understood by the composer. \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" represents the jovial, expansive nature of the planet and its Roman mythological counterpart, Jupiter – the king of the gods and the god of the sky. As the bringer of jollity, Holst's Jupiter is characterized by an exuberance of life, warmth, and good cheer. The piece features a robust, rhythmic energy that showcases an expansive and ambitious melody, reflecting jovial themes of optimism and ebullience. The movement is composed of a series of rhythmic patterns and thematic materials that are developed throughout, creating a sense of vitality and enthusiasm. One of the most famous sections of \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" is the central portion, often referred to as the \\"big tune\\" or the \\"Jupiter Hymn.\\" This noble, majestic melody is evocative of British patriotism and has been described as representing a sense of pride and unity. This melody later became the basis of the British patriotic hymn \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country,\\" with lyrics written by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice in 1921. Overall, \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" is a spirited, uplifting, and splendid piece that captures the essence of joy and conviviality often associated with its eponymous planet and Roman deity. This movement has garnered widespread acclaim since its premiere and is regarded as one of the most iconic and popular works in Holst's \\"The Planets Suite.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. What makes you happy, and what does not? The best way to figure that out is to track your daily activities. Keep track of everything you do during the day. You might also want to note when and how long you did it--as playing video games online for 30 minutes may have a very different effect if it is a four hour session. You might write things like “rode my bike to work” or “watched Netflix”. Find a system that works for you. You could keep a small notebook with you or use the Memo or Notepad function on your phone to log activities. At the end of each day, look back over your activity log. Using a scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, rate each activity depending on how it made you feel. “10” might indicate “very depressed” while “1” could mean “feeling really happy”. For example, maybe you missed your bus and had to walk home in the rain. You might rate that as a high number on your scale. Maybe you had a nice talk on the phone with your mom. That might earn a low score on your scale. Keep in mind that it is important to be objective and stick with a specific type of rating system since people tend to magnify their symptoms when they are depressed. You may find surprises. For instance, you might figure out you really do feel better after walking after dinner--even though you keep stating you hate exercise. Or, conversely, you keep saying you like hanging out with Tamara but every time you have lunch together you feel worse afterwards. Spend a week or 2 tracking your activities and rating your depression. Then spend some time looking back over your logs. Notice whether there are certain activities that consistently rate really low on your scale. Then make sure to regularly spend time doing those activities. Maybe “reading for pleasure” always rates as a 1 in your log. Make it a point to allow yourself some time to enjoy that activity each day. It doesn’t have to be a lot of time. Just set aside 30 minutes before bed and take that time to enjoy yourself. Depression leads to feeling overwhelmed, and can interfere with planning or prioritizing--which causes more havoc and a depression spiral. Having a clear list can help battle these problems. Use your activity tracking to help you. For example, if you know you have a stressful meeting on Monday, make sure to schedule some extra time for something you enjoy, such as reading a new novel that you're interested in. Knowing that you’ll be able to unwind might make getting through the meeting easier. Make sure the \\"to-do\\" list is realistic. Too many things on your list can end up being counter-productive. Instead of focused, you may get overwhelmed and not do anything or feel bad that it was not completed. Depression can also make it difficult or impossible to complete tasks. Depression is a real disease, not just \\"feeling sad,\\" and exhaustion, aches, pains, and more are real symptoms. Getting out of bed and taking a shower may be accomplishment enough on some days, never mind cleaning the oven or returning an email. Do not treat the to-do list as something that trumps your need for honoring physical symptoms. Prioritize self-care. A common error in to-do lists is not prioritizing your emotional needs--not just work, school, home maintenance, or the errands. Doing things that make you feel good and take care of yourself is just as important--sometimes more so. Putting time aside to play with your cat, take a walk, pray, speak to a friend, or draw can make it so you can tackle the other things. Once you’ve started to understand what triggers your depression and what makes it better, you can start challenging yourself to make some positive changes. Figure out what would make you feel better and set some goals to make that happen. Make sure each goal is specific. For example, instead of saying “I want to eat healthier,” try saying, “I will eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day and I will cut out fried foods. Create attainable goals. Instead of saying “I will find the perfect partner to spend my life with,” say, “I will go to the party that my friend is throwing and let him introduce me to some of his other friends.\\"","completion":"To improve happiness and manage depression, track daily activities and rate them on a personal scale, then prioritize activities that make you feel good, while also setting attainable goals for positive change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation: -927*h + 115308 + 117189 = -7848*h + 4104 First, let's find out how many h's we have. We'll do this by adding 927*h to both sides to cancel out the -927*h on the left side: (-927*h + 927*h) + 115308 + 117189 = -7848*h + 927*h + 4104 This simplifies to: 115308 + 117189 = -6921*h + 4104 (because -7848*h + 927*h = -6921*h) Now, let's combine the numbers on the left side by adding them: 232497 = -6921*h + 4104 (because 115308 + 117189 = 232497) Next, we need to get rid of that 4104 on the right side. Let's subtract 4104 from both sides: 232497 - 4104 = -6921*h This simplifies to: 228393 = -6921*h (because 232497 - 4104 = 228393) Now, we need to find the value of h. To do that, let's divide both sides by -6921: 228393 / -6921 = h When we do the division, we find out that: h = -33 There you go, buddy!

Lee, a U-M doctoral candidate, who conducted the study with Norbert Schwarz, a psychologist at the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR), the Ross School of Business, and the U-M psychology department. For the study, Lee and Schwarz asked 87 students to play the role of lawyers competing with a colleague, \\"Chris\\", for a promotion. Each was asked to imagine they found an important document that Chris had lost, and that returning the document would help his career and hurt their own career. Each participant was instructed to leave Chris a message by either voice mail or email, telling him who they were and either lying that they could not find his document or telling the truth that they had found the document. Next, participants rated the desirability of several products as part of a supposed marketing survey and reported how much they were willing to pay for each product. The products included mouthwash and hand sanitizer . Study participants who lied on the phone, leaving an untrue and mean voicemail, felt a stronger desire for mouthwash and were willing to pay more for it than those who lied on e-mail. And conversely, those who lied on e-mail, typing the same mean message, felt a stronger desire for hand sanitizer and were willing to pay more for _ .

What are the most important words in the following sentence: eagles are being trained to take down drones from the sky","completion":"The most important words in the given sentence are \\"eagles,\\" \\"trained,\\" \\"take down,\\" \\"drones,\\" and \\"sky.\\" Here's an analysis of why each of these words plays a crucial role in conveying the meaning of the sentence: 1. Eagles: This word is significant because it specifies the type of animals being trained. Eagles are known for their exceptional strength, sharp vision, and incredible hunting capabilities, making them suitable for the task mentioned in the sentence. 2. Trained: The word \\"trained\\" denotes that the eagles are being prepared for a specific purpose. It indicates a process and implies that these birds have been, or are being, taught the necessary skills to achieve that purpose. This term establishes the distinction between eagles found in nature and the ones involved in the task mentioned here. 3. Take down: This phrase is vital because it defines the objective of the training program. \\"Take down\\" is an action phrase describing the ultimate goal of the training, which is for the eagles to be able to remove or neutralize the drones. 4. Drones: \\"Drones\\" is an essential word in this sentence because it identifies the target of the eagles' training. Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that serve several purposes, and their usage has increased in recent years. This term highlights the nature of the threat or challenge that the eagles are being trained to deal with. 5. Sky: The word \\"sky\\" is crucial because it establishes the context for the action. \\"Sky\\" indicates where the eagles will be performing their task, so it's relevant to both the setting of the activity and to concepts related to aerial surveillance and drone usage. In summary, the words \\"eagles,\\" \\"trained,\\" \\"take down,\\" \\"drones,\\" and \\"sky\\" are critical in this sentence as they collaboratively communicate the main idea: that eagles are being prepared to neutralize or remove drones from the sky, an action that likely has significant implications in terms of security, safety, and environmental concerns."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are so many self tanning products out there, it can be difficult to choose one that will work for you. Some formulas allow you to build a tan gradually over the course of a few days or a week, while others immediately stain your skin bronze. Some are long-lasting, while others wear off after a week or wash off at the end of the day. Figure out which product is best for your needs: Gradual self-tanning formulas. These come in the form of creams, gels, sprays or foams. Gradual self-tanning formulas usually contain either dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and Erythrulose, both of which work by reacting with the amino acids on the skin surface to create a darker complexion. One application will darken the skin by just a shade or so, but you can keep applying the product over the course of several days to achieve the color you want. Instant tanning formulas. Most instant tanners are sprays that you can apply immediately for a sun-kissed look. Some stay in place for about a week, while others can be washed away at the end of the day. Instant formulas are trickier to apply than gradual formulas, since they stain the skin right away and might leave streaks. Face tanning formulas. Look for a self-tanner designed for use on the face if yours is on the sensitive or oily side. While most self-tanners work on the body and the face equally well, you'll want to get one specifically for the face if your skin is a little finicky. Pick the right color. If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium color. If you have olive skin, choose a dark formula. You can always reapply the self-tanner to deepen your tan if your first application looks too light. Thick hair can get in the way of self-tanner when you're trying to apply it evenly. You might want to shave or wax your legs (and arms, if necessary) to ensure you'll be happy with the final appearance of your tan. If you have fine hair on your legs or arms, there's no need to remove it before tanning unless you want to. Guys might also want to shave or wax the chest or back before applying self tanner. No matter what your skin type, is, it's best to exfoliate well in the shower before tanning. When your skin has dry, flaky patches, it's a lot harder to apply self-tanner evenly, and you'll end up with a patchy look instead of a pretty finish. The chemicals in self tanner react with amino acids in the upper layers of your skin. By removing the uppermost layer (which would've sloughed off on its own soon anyway) you're ensuring that the tan develops in a fresh layer that's going to be around longer. Also, dry skin tends to absorb more color, increasing the likelihood of an uneven tan. To exfoliate, use a washcloth, a scrub brush or scrub gel to thoroughly exfoliate all of the areas you're tanning. Focus on rough spots like your elbows and knees. The self-tanner tends to darken these areas more than other parts of your body, since it soaks in faster. Rough skin will cause the application to look even more uneven. Moisturize the skin after exfoliating, particularly if your skin is dry. Pay attention to areas like the knees and elbows where tan can build up. Use lotion or oil to trap the moisture in your skin after your shower. Allow it to fully absorb into your skin over an hour or so before you apply the self-tanner. It's important that while you're applying the self tanner, your skin is completely dry. If you're going to be in the bathroom, wait for any humidity from the bath or shower to subside. Make sure it's cool enough wherever you are so that you don't sweat for the next few hours. A rushed self-tanning job is immediately obvious. You'll miss some spots, have streaky areas or stain your clothes and hands. Do yourself a favor and set aside several hours so you can make sure you have enough time to thoroughly and evenly cover each area you're planning to tan.","completion":"This article discusses various self-tanning product options, including gradual, instant, and face tanning formulas, and provides detailed steps on choosing the right color, preparing the skin through exfoliation and moisturizing, and applying the tanner for an even and long-lasting tan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – The family of a Florida man who was shot and killed in his garage by a police deputy has been awarded just 4 in damages, reports CBS. Gregory Hill was playing music in his garage on an afternoon in 2014 when a neighbor called the police to complain, the New York Times reports. Deputy Christopher Newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old Hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his Fort Pierce home. The police said Hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded Hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door (which had been opened for the deputies) was closed again and Newman shot at Hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of Hill’s three children. Last week, a federal jury delivered a verdict that baffled them. It found Newman had not used excessive force, but that St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara had been negligent (due to Newman's actions)—but only minimally so. Specifically, the sheriff's office was found to be just 1% at fault for Hill's death, so the damages (1 for funeral expenses and 1 for each child’s suffering) were reduced to 4 cents from 4. The family's lawyer says, due to Hill's intoxication, the judge will further reduce the award from 4 cents to nothing. “I don’t get it,” the family's lawyer tells the Times. \\"I think [the jurors] were trying to insult the case. Why go there with the 1? That was the hurtful part.\\" Article:","completion":"Once upon a time in Florida, there was a man named Gregory Hill. One day, he was playing music in his garage and a neighbor didn't like it, so they called the police. Two police officers, including Deputy Christopher Newman, came to see what was going on. They said Gregory had a gun, but he was just in his garage with the door closed. Then, the police officer named Newman shot Gregory through the garage door, hitting him three times, and sadly, Gregory died. Gregory's family was very upset and they thought the police officer shouldn't have done that. So, they asked some smart people called lawyers to help them. They went to a place called a courtroom where people decide if something is right or wrong. The family wanted some money to say sorry for what happened to Gregory and his three kids. But when the people who had to make a decision, called a jury, talked about it, they said something very strange. They said that the police officer didn't do anything very wrong and that the boss of all the police, Sheriff Ken Mascara, was only a tiny bit wrong. They said the family should get just 4 – that's 1 for funeral expenses and 1 for each of Gregory's kids who were left behind and really sad. The lawyer said that because Gregory was drinking and feeling a funny way, the judge might even say they can't have any money at all. The family's lawyer and everyone else couldn't understand why the jury said that. They thought the jury was being mean and just trying to make fun of them by saying they should only get 1. That made the family and the lawyer even more sad and confused."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

These two people were called lawmakers, which means the people in their town chose them to make rules and help the town stay safe and happy. Even though these lawmakers were supposed to be really good at following the rules they made, they made a big mistake. They didn't tell the truth about something very important. They secretly had a special friendship with each other, which wasn't allowed because they had promised to be best friends with someone else. It's like having a best friend and then deciding to have another best friend and not telling the first best friend. What they did was wrong, but what happened next was even worse. Instead of saying sorry and telling everyone what they did, they tried to hide it. They came up with a plan to lie and trick everyone in the town, which is not what good lawmakers are supposed to do. Luckily, some people figured out what they were doing and decided to catch them. So, they told everyone what had happened, and the lawmakers had to say they were sorry. But because they didn't follow the rules, a big group of important people special called \\"House of Representatives\\" thought about a big punishment for them. These people thought that maybe they shouldn't be lawmakers anymore. This is called being \\"recommended for removal,\\" which means they might have to stop being lawmakers and let someone else try to do a better job. It teaches them a lesson that if they want to be in charge of making rules, they have to follow the rules, too. So, the story of the two lawmakers reminds us that when we make a mistake, it's always better to tell the truth and say sorry, instead of trying to hide it. And if we want to be good friends and helpers in our town, we have to make sure we follow the rules, just like everyone else."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: The Universal event pic is the first of the recent fairy tale retellings to win at the box office; Ridley Scott's \\"Prometheus\\" opens overseas to stellar 35 million from only 15 markets, nearly matching the 39.3 million grossed by \\"Snow White\\" from 45 territories. Universal's Snow White and the Huntsman has succeeded in winning over moviegoers, topping the domestic box office with a better-than-expected 56.3 million and opening to 95.6 million worldwide. Sony's Men in Black 3 won the weekend overseas, however, grossing a strong 79.1 million in its sophomore session for a worldwide total of 387.7 million and international cume of 275.4 million. Domestically, the pic placed No. 2 with a pleasing 29.3 million for a 10 day cume of 112.3 million. MIB3's impressive global hold is, at least in part, a testament to Smith's continuing star status, as well as good word of mouth. Snow White -- starring Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth -- debuted to a solid but not spectacular 39.3 million internationally from 45 markets, and it will need svelte legs both at home and abroad to make back its 170 million production budget and hefty marketing spend. It has yet to a debut in a number of key foreign territories, including Russia and Australia. The film's undeniable domestic strength is a needed win for Universal after box-office stumbles Battleship and The Five-Year Engagement. It's also the first of the recent fairy tale retellings to strike a chord with moviegoers, and a sequel is already in active development. \\"From the get-go, the filmmakers, the cast and the studio conveyed how very unique this movie was and that its appeal would go beyond the usual Snow White audience,\\" Universal president of domestic distribution Nikki Rocco said. Snow White was directed by Rupert Sanders and produced by Joe Roth. PHOTOS: 'Snow White and the Huntsman' Starring Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth It wasn't the only new Hollywood event pic making headlines. Opening in 15 markets overseas a week ahead of its June 8 domestic debut, Ridley Scott's 3D sci-fi spectacle Prometheus grossed a stellar 35 million for 20th Century Fox. Prometheus -- also starring Theron, as well as Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender -- handily beat Snow White in the U.K. (10 million versus 5 million), the only market where the two movies went up against each other. The top territory for Prometheus was Russia with 11.1 million. Prometheus is performing especially well for an R-rated pic (in the U.K., it has the equivalent of a 15 rating). Snow White opened higher overseas than The Hunger Games (38.7 million) and the first Twilight (30 million). Snow White opened No. 1 in 30 of the markets and generated strong returns in Latin America and Asia, including placing No. 1 in Mexico with 4.4 million. The U.K. was the film's highest-grossing market. VIDEO: 'Snow White and the Huntsman': Colleen Atwood on Creating the Fairy Tale Costumes Universal's marketing operation is being praised by rival studios for succeeding in piquing the interest of males on the eve of Snow White's opening. The action-packed film needed both sexes to succeed and was never designed to appeal only to femmes. Exit polling revealed that females made up 53 percent of the opening weekend audience in North America, while males made up 47 percent. Snow White did skew older, with 56 percent of the audience over the age of 25 and 52 percent over the age of 30. The film's B CinemaScore didn't appear to slow down the film, which was up on Saturday. PHOTOS: 28 of Summer's Most Anticipated Movies: 'Avengers,' 'Dark Knight,' 'Prometheus' The weekend's other new wide entry was Arc Entertainment's historic epic For Greater Glory. The Andy Garcia-Eva Longoria starrer placed 10th with an estimated 1.8 million from 757 theaters. At the specialty box office, Fox Searchlight's The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Focus Features' Moonrise Kingdom both continued to turn in strong performances, along with French blockbuster comedy The Intouchables, distributed by the Weinstein Co. The new offering at the specialty box office was Dimension Films' Piranha 3DD, which the Weinstein Co. released under its Radius TWC banner, meaning the pic opened simultaneously in theaters and on premium VOD. The Weinstein Co. had muted theatrical expectations for the film, which grossed 179,000 from 86 theaters for a location average of 7,004. Early numbers suggest it is doing good business on VOD. Exotic Marigold Hotel grossed 4.6 million domestically from 1,294 theaters for a cume of 25.5 million. The feel-good pic, which has earned north of 107 million worldwide, placed No. 6 domestically. In its second weekend, Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom grossed 848,681 from 16 theaters for an impressive per-location average of 53,043 and cume of 1.7 million. Intouchables grossed 350,186 from 50 theaters in its second outing for a location average of 7,004 and cume of 516,798. ||||| \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" easily made it out of the woods at the box office this weekend, as the film's debut far exceeded industry projections. The fairy-tale adaptation opened with a surprisingly robust 56.3 million, according to an estimate from distributor Universal Pictures — about 10 million more than pre-release audience surveys had indicated the film would bring in on its first weekend in release. That meant that of the two films based on \\"Snow White\\" to hit theaters this year, \\"Huntsman\\" was the fairest of them all. Back in March, Relativity Media's bouncier family version \\"Mirror Mirror,\\" starring Julia Roberts and Lily Collins, debuted with a weak 18 million and collected 62 million by the end of its run. \\"Snow White and the Huntsman,\\" featuring \\"Twilight\\"star Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron, has a darker tone than \\"Mirror Mirror.\\" Universal also spent much more to produce \\"Snow White\\" — about 170 million, compared with a 100-million budget for the Relativity film. The movie's respectable opening is welcome positive news for Universal, which is coming off the disastrous box-office performance of its 209-million production \\"Battleship.\\" Behind the Navy action flick, \\"Snow White\\" is the most expensive movie the studio is releasing in 2012 and part of a strategy to spend more on films that will appeal to a global audience. Those who saw \\"Snow White\\" in the U.S. this weekend gave the film an average grade of B, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Roughly 52% of the movie's audience was over the age of 30, which could bode well for Stewart's career. Before \\"Snow White,\\" the actress had yet to appear in any major film outside of the massively popular \\"Twilight\\" series. With the vampire franchise coming to a close this fall, \\"Snow White\\" is the first indication that the 22-year-old has appeal outside of the young female \\"Twilight\\" fan base. Overseas, \\"Snow White\\" debuted in 45 foreign countries and sold 39.3 million worth of tickets. It had the strongest debut in the United Kingdom, where the picture grossed 5.5 million, and also did well in Spain and Mexico. Although the film performed solidly abroad, it didn't do as well as Ridley Scott's \\"Prometheus,\\" the sci-fi movie which hits U.S. theaters next weekend. Playing in 15 foreign markets, the 3-D film collected 35 million and was No. 1 in 14 countries. The movie, which stars an ensemble cast including Theron, Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, sold the most tickets in Russia — 11.1 million. Next weekend, the picture will open in 35 additional international locations, including Australia and Taiwan. Meanwhile, \\"The Avengers\\" passed the final installment of \\"Harry Potter\\" to become the third-highest-grossing film of all time, not adjusting for inflation. With its 1.4-billion worldwide sum, the picture has now only made less than James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" and \\"Titanic.\\" A smaller film, however, didn't have as much success at the box office this weekend. The Weinstein Co.'s garish horror sequel \\"Piranha 3DD\\" debuted in 86 cinemas this weekend and grossed a dismal 179,000. Those opening-weekend figures indicate the film won't come near to making the 83 million\\"Piranha 3D\\" grossed worldwide in 2010. [Updated, 11:48 a.m. June 3: \\"Men in Black 3\\" had a solid second weekend in theaters, with its ticket sales dropping 46% to 29.3 million. But the movie is performing far better overseas, where the third installment in the sci-fi comedy franchise has already raked in over 275 million. Moviegoers in China and Russia — where 3-D and special effects are especially popular — are so far most interested in seeing the picture abroad. Here are the top 10 movies at the domestic box office, with international results when available, according to studio estimates and Rentrak: 1. \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" (Universal): Opened with 56.3 million. 39.3 million overseas in 45 foreign markets. 2. \\"Men in Black 3\\" (Sony/Hemisphere Media Capital): 29.3 million on its second weekend, down 46%.

The movie opens in the U.S. on June 1. (Reuters) - \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" broke the spell of lackluster performances by many big-budget films this summer season at movie theaters, grabbing 56.3 million in its first weekend to top \\"Men in Black 3,\\" according to studio estimates on Sunday. The film, a dark and sometimes violent take on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, collected an additional 39.3 million in 45 international markets where it also opened this weekend. The solid debut led Universal Pictures' \\"Snow White\\" to escape the fate of \\"Battleship,\\" also distributed by Universal, and Warner Bros' vampire film \\"Dark Shadows,\\" both of which fell victim to blockbuster \\"The Avengers.\\" \\"I'm very happy about it. The uniqueness of the campaign from the get-go made (the film) stand out as not just the quintessential fairy tale; it was telling a very different story,\\" Nikki Rocco, president of domestic distribution at Universal Pictures, told Reuters. \\"Men in Black 3,\\" which opened last week, collected 29.3 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters to fall to the No. 2 position on U.S. and Canadian box office charts. Starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as black-suited secret agents, together again for the first time since 2002, \\"MIB 3\\" ticket sales slipped by 58 percent from its opening weekend. It has collected 274.6 million in overseas markets since its release. \\"Snow White and the Huntsman,\\" which starred Kristen Stewart from box office hit \\"The Twilight Saga\\" vampire films, Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth from \\"The Avengers,\\" is the second film this year inspired by the classic fairy tale. In March, \\"Mirror Mirror,\\" starring Julia Roberts as the evil queen, failed to gain large audiences with 18 million on its first weekend and 62 million in domestic ticket sales. Producers of that film rushed to beat \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" to the screen, changing their opening date from June to March. \\"The filmmakers, producers and the talent knew how different this film would be. We had no concern whatsoever,\\" said Rocco. \\"Mirror Mirror\\" was ... targeted to little girls. They tried to make a comedy of it. That's not what we were intending to do.\\" Hollywood experts had predicted that \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" would open with a relatively paltry 35 million in ticket sales, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com. The film, which was made for 170 million, needed 42 million in ticket sales over the weekend to break-even, according to analyst Tony Wible, managing director of Janney Montgomery Scott. A film generally completes its run with three times its opening weekend gross, and its studio gets about half the ticket sales revenue. A film also generates revenue from home video and other sales after its theatrical run. \\"AVENGERS\\" MAKES MOVIE HISTORY In its fifth week in theaters, \\"The Avengers\\" collection of Marvel superheros continued to flex its muscles, earning 20.3 million and taking the third position.

Paragraph : By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher. A:","completion":"When you make a rocket heavier, it would generally have a harder time achieving high altitudes and may even fall down if the weight is too much for the propulsion system to overcome. The paragraph mentions the use of multiple stages to address this issue. In a multistage rocket, as one stage's fuel is used up, the empty fuel containers can be detached or dropped away from the rocket. This process of shedding mass allows the rocket to become lighter and makes it easier for it to achieve greater heights. The reduction of mass due to dropping empty fuel containers increases the overall efficiency of a rocket as it conserves fuel and thrust. By utilizing this method, the rocket not only lessens the negative effects of a heavier mass but also improves its ability to reach higher altitudes or even get into orbit. If a rocket is made heavier without any appropriate adjustments, such as a more powerful propulsion system or incorporating a multistage design, it could struggle to generate enough thrust to counteract Earth's gravitational pull and ultimately fall down or fail to reach its intended destination. In conclusion, when a rocket is made heavier, it is more likely to struggle to reach high altitudes or might even fall down, unless proper techniques like multistage design and more powerful propulsion systems are employed to alleviate the detrimental effects of the increased mass. The paragraph highlights the importance of reducing the rocket's mass by dropping away empty fuel containers to achieve better flight performance and reach higher altitudes more efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The disease once killed 30% of those infected, but after a global vaccination campaign it was declared eradicated in 1980. However the variola virus, which causes the infection, is not gone. It exists in two laboratories, one in the US and the other in Russia. The question is about to be asked, once again: should they kill their stocks? The World Health Organization (WHO) will come to a decision at the 64th World Health Assembly this week. It is not the first time the issue has arisen, it was first discussed at the Assembly in 1986 and has been the source of debate ever since. Destroying the remaining stocks is seen in parts as the final chapter in eradicating the disease, otherwise there is always the risk of accidental release. Others including the US and Russia argue for more research in case smallpox returns, possibly as a biological weapon. They fear vials of the virus could exist outside of their labs. The genomes of around 50 strains of the variola virus have also been fully sequenced, and research has already shown that a virus can be built from scratch with such a blueprint. Professor Geoffrey Smith, from Imperial College London, has been following the latest research on smallpox. He says studies have been focused on three areas - tests to diagnose the infection quickly and accurately, antiviral drugs to treat it and safer vaccines to prevent it. He led a review of the state of scientific research on behalf of the WHO, which was published at the end of 2010, and concluded there had been \\"remarkable advances\\" in tests for smallpox. But the same could not be said with certainty for smallpox drugs and vaccines. While new candidates have been developed, they cannot be clinically proven as there are no human smallpox patients to test them on. Without trials to prove a medicine works, the endpoint for research becomes harder to define. Professor Smith said: \\"It is fair to say the committee had mixed views on whether the research was there or nearly there but not quite.\\" The US secretary of health Kathleen Sebelius says it would be premature to destroy remaining stores of the virus now. She restated in a column for the New York Times her country's commitment to eventually destroy stocks, but not yet. She wrote: \\"We have more work to do before these safe and highly effective vaccines and antiviral treatments are fully developed and approved for use. \\"Destroying the virus now is merely a symbolic act that would slow our progress and could even stop it completely, leaving the world vulnerable.\\" But the man who led the WHO's smallpox eradication programme from 1966 until the last case in 1977 disagrees. Dr DA Henderson told the BBC: \\"I think it's a very good idea to destroy. At this point the reasons for keeping it are very obscure. Group after group has looked at this and basically said there is no need to retain it. In 1796, Edward Jenner extracted pus from a cowpox pustule on a milkmaiden and inserted it into a cut in the arm of an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps. He was working from rural folklore which said milkmaids who suffered cowpox never went onto develop smallpox. Jenner then proved that having been inoculated with cowpox Phipps was immune to smallpox. In 1959 the World Health Assembly passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox. The last natural case of smallpox was in Somalia in October 1977. In September 1978 Janet Parker, a medical photographer at the University of Birmingham died after being accidentally infected with smallpox. BBC History: Smallpox, Eradicating the Scourge \\"We have done all of the productive research that we can do. It has been discussed fully and thoroughly by people around the world. Now is the time to destroy the virus as a further deterrent to anybody ever again producing it or using it.\\" Professor John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary University of London, believes the bioterrorism threat is \\"a load of old tosh\\" but still argues in favour of keeping the virus. He said the decision was \\"tricky\\" but added: \\"I don't think there's a strong argument to destroy stocks, just an instinctive feeling to do it, which is misplaced. \\"It's eradicating a whole species and you never know what the future might hold.\\" The argument holds no weight with Professor Gareth Williams, whose book - Angel of Death - charts the history of smallpox. \\"There is no point in keeping it really. It has been sequenced completely so it can be recreated in a test tube and if it comes back you've got as much virus as you could want. \\"It's just a vague sense of political unease keeping stocks, it has nothing to do with the scientific argument.\\" No one knows what will happen when health ministers from the WHO's 193 member nations discuss the issue. Professor David Heymann, a former assistant director general for health security and environment at the World Health Organization, said there had historically been a split between the industrialised and developing countries. He said developing countries have felt it is more important to deal with \\"known risks\\" than unknown risks like smallpox, while industrialised nations have different priorities. Resolutions from the World Health Assembly are not legally binding, so the US and Russia cannot be forced to destroy stocks even if the majority of nations wanted it to happen. The Assembly could reach a consensus agreement, such as postponing the decision, rather than forcing a vote because, as Professor Heymann puts it, \\"nobody wants to see the World Health Organization lose power\\" if its rulings are ignored.

She was tired of struggling and fighting and wanted to give up. So, her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out, pulled the eggs out and then poured the coffee into three different bowls. Turning to her daughter, she asked, \\"Tell me what you see.\\" \\"Carrots, eggs, and coffee,\\" she replied. Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the daughter was asked to drink the coffee. She smiled as she tasted its rich fragrance. The daughter then asked, \\"What does it mean, mother?\\" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same disaster but reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, and hard. However, after being subject to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The coffee beans were unique, however; after they had been in the boiling water, they had changed the water. \\"Which are you?\\" she asked her daughter. \\"When misfortune or change knocks on your door, how do you respond?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the place which seemingly grew no nearer in the succeeding days though the pair continued struggling toward it? ? The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

Use evidence from the fact that living things all require energy for survival to answer this question: \\"If I wanted to get more energy after exerting myself too much\\"","completion":"If you wanted to get more energy after exerting yourself too much, it is essential first to understand how living organisms, including humans, obtain and utilize energy for various biological processes. Firstly, living things have various cellular processes that require energy to function. This energy is produced in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. ATP is generated through cellular respiration, a process in which the cells break down nutrients like glucose to release energy. Considering this fact, when one exerts themselves too much, their energy reserves are likely to be depleted. As a result, the body requires more nutrients and other vital compounds to restore its balance. To gain more energy following intense physical activity, there are several ways you can achieve this: 1. Rehydrate: Staying hydrated is critical to maintaining energy levels. During exertion, you lose water and electrolytes, leading to fatigue or even dehydration. Drinking water or electrolyte-containing beverages can help restore balance and maintain energy levels. 2. Eat the right nutrients: Consuming a diet rich in macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is vital to replenishing energy stores. High-quality carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, provide glucose, which the body uses to generate ATP. Lean proteins, such as poultry, fish, or legumes, supply amino acids to rebuild and maintain muscles. Consuming healthy fats, like those found in nuts, seeds, and avocado, can also provide long-lasting energy. 3. Get proper rest: After strenuous exercise, it is essential to rest and allow your body to recover. This recovery period helps in restoring energy reserves, repairing damaged muscle tissues, and improving overall body functions. Generally, it is recommended to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night to reap the benefits of restorative rest. 4. Consume energy-boosting foods: Some foods can help enhance energy production in the body, such as bananas, oatmeal, almonds, and lentils. These sources are either rich in nutrients required for energy synthesis or work as natural stimulants to increase alertness and help fight fatigue. 5. Regulate blood sugar: Unstable blood sugar levels can cause fluctuations in energy levels and leave you feeling sluggish. Stabilizing blood sugar by eating balanced meals and snacks, rich in fibers, proteins, and healthy fats, can keep your energy levels more consistent. 6. Manage stress: Stress can have a significant impact on energy levels, as it often causes both mental and physical fatigue. Engaging in stress-reduction techniques like meditation, mindfulness, or yoga can help enhance overall well-being and increase energy. In summary, if you want to get more energy after exerting yourself too much, it is essential to focus on the aspects of rehydration, proper nutrition, rest, stress management, and consuming foods thatboost energy. By addressing these factors, you will be better equipped to restore and optimize your body's energy production and overall functionality, allowing you to recover more effectively from strenuous physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Are Rose McDowall and Corinne Drewery both in the same band? Answer:","completion":"After conducting an analysis of each artist's career, it is evident that Rose McDowall and Corinne Drewery are not in the same band. They have, in fact, made individual contributions to different bands in the music industry. Let's delve deeper into their respective careers. Rose McDowall, born in 1959, is a Scottish musician best known for her work as the vocalist for the alternative bands Strawberry Switchblade and Spell. Strawberry Switchblade, formed in 1981, was a duo comprising of McDowall and Jill Bryson. They received considerable attention in the early 1980s with their blend of post-punk, synthpop, and new wave music. McDowall later formed the experimental group Spell in the 1990s, which was a collaborative effort between her and Boyd Rice, an American musician. Some other notable collaborations in McDowall's career include: 1. Current 93 - An experimental music group led by David Tibet. 2. Coil - An experimental electronic group led by John Balance and Peter Christopherson. 3. Psychic TV - A British experimental group led by Genesis P-Orridge. 4. Death In June - A British post-punk group led by Douglas P. Over the years, Rose McDowall has worked with numerous other artists and has released several solo projects. However, none of these collaborations or solo works have included a partnership with Corinne Drewery. Corinne Drewery, on the other hand, is an English singer and fashion designer born in 1959. She is best known as the lead vocalist for the British acid jazz and sophisti-pop group Swing Out Sister. With origins dating back to 1985, Swing Out Sister was formed by Drewery, Andy Connell, and Martin Jackson. The band earned international recognition in the late 1980s and 1990s for their combination of pop, jazz, and electronic music, providing a platform for Drewery's soulful voice. Throughout her career, Corinne Drewery has mainly focused on her work with Swing Out Sister. Although she occasionally dabbles in solo projects or lends her vocal talents to other artists, she has never been associated with the same bands as Rose McDowall. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that Rose McDowall and Corinne Drewery are not members of the same band. Rather, they have each carved out their own distinct paths within the music industry, earning independent acclaim and fan bases."},{"prompt":"Given the question: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress.

The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it.

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Act 2: Invigorated by the challenge and fueled by nostalgia, Jay enlists the help of his estranged childhood friend and fellow car enthusiast, Mark. Together, the duo works tirelessly to restore the '58 Triumph; along the way, they learn about its previous owners, including a dashing and romantic movie star from the '60s, a gifted race car driver whose career ended tragically in the '70s, and a female jazz singer with a sultry voice in the '80s.

As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides. We put turbines into the mouth of the river. Then the tide comes in, the water turns the turbines and then it goes out, it turns them again. Which of these ways will be used to run our cars in the future? Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE? - There is more petroleum than we can use now. - Trees are needed for some other things besides making gas. - We got electricity from ocean tides in the old days. - Gas wasn't used to run cars in the Second World War. The answer is:","completion":"\\"Trees are needed for some other things besides making gas.\\" The article clearly emphasizes that we can't cut down all our trees to make gas because we need our trees for other things too. This assertion makes sense given the many uses of trees, including supplying oxygen, conserving water, supporting wildlife, and providing raw materials for construction and paper industries. Contrarily, the remaining statements are inaccurately reflective of the information presented in the article. The first statement, \\"There is more petroleum than we can use now,\\" is untrue as the article begins by highlighting the lacking availability of oil. The third statement, \\"We got electricity from ocean tides in the old days,\\" is not verified in the text, which only mentions the potential for harnessing power from ocean tides in the future. Lastly, the fourth statement, \\"Gas wasn't used to run cars in the Second World War,\\" is incorrect.

Birthday presents wrapped in colorful paper, brown paper packages mailed from a friend. No matter what kind of box it is, people like to open it up and see what's inside. In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It's called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course of history. Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means \\"the people rule,\\" an important concept in American history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colonies angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the government of England didn't represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government. An effective democracy holds regular elections. In America, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the polls to elect the nation's president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law. In the American electoral system, people don't really vote for presidential candidates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for \\"electors\\" who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number of its representatives in the House (which is based on the state's population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state's electors. To win the presidential election, a candidate must gain at least 270 of the 538 total electoral votes. Over the years, the U.S. has made a number of... Question: What's the main idea of this passage?

Paragraph: Do not look for the Danteum in the Eternal City. In true Dantean form, politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938. Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well.

Article:","completion":"Title: Maximizing Engagement Through Online Course Management Systems Introduction: As online learning becomes more prevalent in education, both instructors and students must adapt to new methods of engagement, communication, and assessment. An essential tool for managing an online course is the online management system, which allows instructors to organize, deliver, and monitor coursework while providing students with a platform for easy access and collaboration. In this article, we will discuss how to effectively use an online management system for managing a course, including monitoring student postings, preparing interactive lesson plans, presenting learning content in varied formats, and keeping students informed of deadlines. Step 1: Get Familiar with the Online Management System: Before diving into teaching an online course, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the management system to ensure smooth and effective communication with students. Take time to explore available features such as discussion boards, grade books, assignment submissions, and event scheduling. Explore customization options that can enhance your course and make it more engaging for students. Test the system's functionality, and consider collaborating with colleagues or attending available training sessions to ensure proficiency. Step 2: Monitor Student Postings: Communication plays a vital role in online learning, and the online management system often serves as the primary channel for students to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate. Keep track of student postings on discussion boards, forums, and messaging platforms within the system to maintain a pulse on students' understanding and engagement. Respond to questions and comments promptly to clarify doubts and encourage further discussion. Monitoring and engaging with student postings also allow for early identification of struggling students, enabling timely intervention. Step 3: Prepare Interactive Lesson Plans: An essential element of effective online teaching is the integration of interactive activities that engage students and promote active learning. Include activities such as group discussions, problem-solving exercises, and polls in your lesson plans. Utilize the features available within the online management system to facilitate these activities, making sure that instructions are clear and concise. Provide ample opportunities for students to collaborate and learn from one another, fostering a sense of community within the online classroom. Step 4: Present Learning Content in Varied Formats: Online learning offers multiple avenues for the presentation of content. Instructors should take advantage of this diversity by providing learning resources in various formats, catering to different learning styles. Present content through a mix of text, images, videos, and audio to accommodate all learners. Incorporate interactive elements such as quizzes, simulations, and self-check assessments to gauge understanding and provide immediate feedback for students. Step 5: Keep Students Informed of Deadlines and Due Dates: Timely reminders and updates regarding upcoming deadlines, due dates, and events are crucial in an online course, where students may have limited face-to-face interactions with instructors and peers. Post daily updates in prominent locations within the online management system, such as announcement sections, main forums, and email notifications. Clear and consistent communication helps students stay on track and manage their time effectively. Conclusion: Online course management systems play a crucial role in facilitating adaptive and engaging learning experiences for students. By taking advantage of these systems' features and fostering a supportive online community, instructors can create an effective and enjoyable online learning environment for their students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this list available to all your employees so that they know how much is being consumed on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. This is probably the most cautious and most effective beginning point for any established business in terms of starting to go green. By cutting pack, you can start saving your company money almost immediately. Seeing immediate results will give you (and your employees) incentive to keep going. For example, consider making a preliminary goal of cutting back on energy usage. If you decided to use compact-fluorescent lights or LED lights, you will use 75 percent less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs. This means that you will save roughly 200 per bulb over time because these bulbs last longer and use less energy than standard lightbulbs.Use this Energy Savings Calculator to help determine the value of switching to energy efficient bulbs: http://www.bulbs.com/learning/energycalc.aspx. How much paper does your business use daily? Studies show that a typical office disposes approximately 350 pounds of waste paper per employee per year. Can you cut down on your paper use? Try switching to digital procedures to invoice your clients and pay your bills. Scan in important contracts and email them rather than printing them and putting them in the mail. Discourage staff in your office from printing every email or even other documentation. Teach workers how to sort their emails, so they don't have to rely on hard copies. Encourage them to read necessary presentations, emails, or documents on screen. When printing is necessary, use both sides of the paper (double-sided printing). To make sure people remember this, it's helpful if you set your printer to automatically print double sided. You can also program your fax machine not to print out confirmation pages. When you do have to use paper, make sure you use post-consumer waste (PCW) paper. PCW paper is made completely from paper that is put in recycling bins and requires 45 percent less energy and makes half the waste of traditional paper making. Be sure to properly train your employees on using the equipment that they need to use. This will help to ensure workers don't make mistakes or waste resources. While it may not seem like a business practice that will help make your business more green, you may be surprised at the positive impact it will have on the greenness of your company. This will give you a better idea about your business's energy efficiency. This constitutes another area in which you can reduce consumption and waste. Make sure that all of your equipment is up-to-date and working properly. If your appliances or machinery require servicing, make sure it is done regularly. This will make sure that the machinery stays in top condition and will make a more pleasant work experience for your employees as well. If you are in need of new or updated appliances, look for Energy Star appliances which have labels that will help you to assess their energy requirements. Even the things your company isn't using directly to make products or selling can be resource wasters. For example, do you have energy-efficient hand dryers in your restrooms, or are you still depending on paper towels? Check things like faucets and toilets. If you have a leaky faucet or a cracked toilet, get it fixed to avoid wasting valuable resources. Make sure that your staff turns off all the lights and equipment at the end of the day to avoid wasting energy when no one is at work. It's helpful to assign someone to be responsible for this daily. Put up signs around the workplace to remind everyone. After a quarter or a year, put up charts showing a comparison of energy savings thanks to employees' efforts. This will help to motivate your employees to keep up energy-conscious behaviors. Switch to energy efficient appliances. Compact fluorescent bulbs use 15 to 20 percent of the energy of an incandescent bulb, last longer and produce as much light. Post a list of energy, supply, and material usage (you can focus on how much is used per month, per quarter, or per year), and alongside this list, post a list of goals for the end of a period of time. Include an incentive if your company can reach your goals. For example, you may want to incentivize your employees with a casual dress day for reaching a resource-reduction goal, or you may want to create an intra-company competition that pits one department against another and offers something like an extra vacation day for the department that reduces consumption the most. Many states will help you with appliance replacements, light bulb replacements, insulation, window replacements, etc. Do a Google search for free energy audits. Many states will perform these energy audits for free, and some will pay for some or all necessary repairs. This can help to identify simple changes that can be made to make yours a greener business.","completion":"Incorporate green practices by tracking resource usage, using energy-efficient appliances and digital procedures, training employees, and offering incentives to reduce waste, ultimately saving company money and conserving resources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This past summer I started learning on my grandmother's old Kenmore. Features about this machine that I love now that I have it are: well, for one all the stich choices, the needle threading feature (so nice!), and the forward and backward automatic button. I give the machine 5 stars because it comes with all the accessories I think would ever need, but I don't really like the case if you can even call it that... it is really more like a hard plastic cover/lid (can't really store anything in it... not even the extension for the table), but it really is a great machine, and the instructions are very easy to read and follow. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. The user highlights several features they love about the machine, such as the stitch choices, needle threading feature, and the forward and backward automatic button. They also mention that it comes with all the accessories they think they would ever need and that the instructions are easy to read and follow. The reviewer gives the machine a 5-star rating. However, they express dissatisfaction with the case, saying it's more like a hard plastic cover/lid and lacks storage space for accessories.

Information: - Gai dimanche ( English : Fun Sunday ) is a 1935 three reel film written by and starring Jacques Tati and his friend Rhum . The pair star as down - and - outs who try to generate funds by providing an impromptu leisure tour in a rickety bus they wrangle use of for free . Released in 1935 and rarely seen today , the film offers brief glimpses and hints towards methods Tati would begin to perfect in his films more than a decade later . The short was included in the Criterion Collection 's \`\` The Complete Jacques Tati '' box set , in a disc containing every short Tati either directed or starred in restored in 2K , which was released on both Blu - ray and DVD on October 18 , 2014 . - Jacques Tati (born Jacques Tatischeff, ; 9 October 1907 5 November 1982) was a French filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, New York City vaudeville actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with Herb, Carl's cameraman, Mike, Carl's soundman, Preston, Carl's assistant, and actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word \\"Kong\\". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack.

Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, he meets a laid-back dog named Dodger who assists him in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Afghan Hound, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Bill Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin it must be paid in three days, or else. Sykes' dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver but he is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money. After the dogs cheer him up, he is introduced to Oliver, and, considering that they all need help, accepts him into the gang.

Goal: baking powder substitiution Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPT: (I). use baking soda and cream of tartar (II). use salt and baking soda, mixed with a little sugar...I think the answer is","completion":"To determine which method is more reasonable for substituting baking powder, let's consider the purpose and properties of baking powder and the properties of the ingredients in each option. Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking to help dough and batters rise. It is a mixture of a base (usually baking soda) and an acid, which create a chemical reaction producing carbon dioxide gas, creating air bubbles and causing the dough to rise. Option I: Use baking soda and cream of tartar In this method, baking soda, a base, is combined with cream of tartar, an acid, to mimic the properties of baking powder. Proportions typically used are: 1. 2 parts cream of tartar to 1 part baking soda Steps for this method: 1. Combine baking soda and cream of tartar in a bowl. 2. Mix thoroughly to create the substitute for baking powder. Option II: Use salt, baking soda, and a little sugar In this method, baking soda is combined with salt and sugar. However, this combination lacks an acidic component, and the chemical reaction required to make the dough or batter rise will not occur. Steps for this method: 1. Combine baking soda, salt, and sugar in a bowl. 2. Mix together for the substitution, although this will not work effectively as a baking powder substitute due to the missing acidic component. Based on the properties and purpose of baking powder, Option I (baking soda and cream of tartar) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of substituting baking powder. It effectively mimics the base and acid combination of baking powder, ensuring the desired leavening occurs in the recipe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Review: I gather at least a few people watched it on Sept.2 on TCM.

I watched because I had just seen a documentary on \\"bad women\\", actresses in the U.S. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early '30s.

Answer the following question: Title: So slow Review: I bought this awhile back and recently tried it when I couldn't go to class one day. The explanations between poses are so long. I realized that after 30 minutes of video, I had only done 4 or 5 poses. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review provided conveys a negative sentiment. The title, \\"So slow,\\" immediately sets a disapproving tone, indicating dissatisfaction or frustration from the user. The reviewer explains that they had purchased the product and had a chance to try it out when they couldn't attend their class. However, their experience was not satisfactory as the explanations between poses were excessively long. The reviewer specifically mentions that they were able to perform only 4 or 5 poses despite watching 30 minutes of the video, highlighting their disappointment in the inefficient usage of time. This suggests that the product may not meet their expectations of a timely and effective yoga or exercise session, leading to an overall negative impression of the product. As the primary purpose of a product review is to share honest opinions and experiences of the product with others, it is important to consider the sentiment expressed in the review when making a purchasing decision. In this case, the negative sentiment and dissatisfaction shared by the reviewer might deter potential buyers from considering the product, potentially affecting its sales and overall reputation. In conclusion, the product review conveys a negative sentiment as it highlights the user's dissatisfaction with the product due to the long explanations between poses and the inefficient use of time during the yoga or exercise session. This review may impact potential buyers' decision making, which could potentially affect the product's overall sales and reputation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"So my duties were restricted to parading around in public and the occasional wave.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I was only allowed to parade down the street once a week.\\"?","completion":"If we analyze the given premise, \\"So my duties were restricted to parading around in public and the occasional wave,\\" it tells us that the speaker's duties involve recurring public appearances where they parade and sometimes engage in waving gestures. However, the premise does not provide explicit information about the frequency for these duties, i.e., how often the speaker is required to parade or wave. Now let us consider the hypothesis, \\"I was only allowed to parade down the street once a week.\\" This statement is a specific claim regarding the frequency of the parading activity mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis confines the parading activity to a fixed schedule, occurring only once a week. Although both the premise and the hypothesis revolve around the parading activity, the premise does not entail the hypothesis as they provide different information regarding the activity. The premise focuses on the nature of the duties, while the hypothesis determines their frequency. The given premise simply does not provide enough grounds to conclude the frequency of parading or the limitation to once a week. If we were to relate the premise and hypothesis logically, we would say that the hypothesis is only a possible conclusion drawn from the premise. The parading frequency could also be daily, bi-weekly, or monthly, among other possibilities. Therefore, based on the premise alone, we cannot decisively conclude the validity of the hypothesis \\"I was only allowed to parade down the street once a week.\\" However, we can speculate that the hypothesis could be true, but it could also be false or partially true (with altered frequency). More information would be needed to validate or invalidate the hypothesis considering the provided premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Options are: (i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","completion":"Based on the premise \\"But some businesses, staffed by people who are not attorneys, have adopted legal aid or similar names, leading some people to believe that they are nonprofits.\\", it is not definitively possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"But actually they are using those people to their advantage to gain large profits.\\" is true or not. Nonetheless, we can discuss the possibilities by carefully examining the given information. Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis in detail: Premise: - Some businesses are staffed by non-attorneys. - These businesses have adopted \\"legal aid\\" or similar names, which could lead people to believe they are nonprofit organizations. Hypothesis: - These businesses are using the non-attorney staff to their advantage. - The motive behind using these staff members is to gain large profits. The premise establishes that certain businesses have adopted names that might confuse people into thinking they're nonprofit organizations because they use terms like \\"legal aid\\" or similar phrases. It also states that these businesses are staffed by non-attorney personnel. However, this premise doesn't explicitly indicate whether these businesses achieve or aim to achieve large profits. Moreover, the premise doesn't confirm if these businesses are deliberately misleading consumers or if it's an unintentional coincidence. The hypothesis suggests that these businesses are indeed trying to take advantage of their non-attorney staff in order to achieve large profits. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we need to consider various scenarios and evaluate supporting or contradicting evidence. One possibility is that these businesses might be intentionally using confusing names to lead people to think they're nonprofits, and by doing so, they might attract customers who are looking for affordable or pro bono legal assistance. In this case, the hypothesis could be accurate because using this perception to their advantage could result in increased profits. On the other hand, the businesses could be using the terms \\"legal aid\\" or similar phrases without realizing the confusion it might cause. In this scenario, they may not be intentionally taking advantage of their non-attorney staff or the public's perception. This could suggest that the hypothesis is not accurate. Given the information we have from the premise, there are multiple possibilities, and it is impossible to confirm or deny the hypothesis without more data. Thus, the most appropriate answer would be option (ii), as it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis is true based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The information available suggests that Mike did not know how to properly do laundry tasks. Firstly, in the given scenario, Greg asked Mike if he could take care of the laundry. Although Mike agreed to do so, he agreed with a caveat, implying that he needed a price or compensation for the task. This could indicate that Mike was either inexperienced with laundry or did not feel comfortable taking on the responsibility without some form of incentive. When Mike proceeded to wash Greg's clothes, the paragraph states that he \\"mixed all the colors and ruined the clothes.\\" This shows that Mike lacked knowledge about the importance of separating clothing by color before washing. As a result, the mixed colors caused damage to Greg's clothes, leaving him understandably upset. The paragraph does not provide any information indicating that Mike learned the correct methods to do laundry after committing these errors. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the statement \\"Mike learned how to do laundry\\" is accurate based solely on the given information and the aftermath of the incident between Greg and Mike. However, it may be reasonable to assume that Mike would have been confronted by Greg about his mistakes or would have figured out on his own that he made errors in the given situation.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accurately measure a liquid in a glass measuring cup, it is essential to follow specific steps and utilize the proper techniques. Below is a detailed explanation of the most sensible method to accomplish this goal. 1. Choose the right measuring cup: Select a glass measuring cup with the appropriate size and clearly marked measurements for the volume of liquid you need to measure. Glass measuring cups usually come in different capacities, such as 1 cup (250 mL), 2 cups (500 mL), or 4 cups (1 L). Make sure the glass measuring cup has metric or standard (US) units corresponding to the recipe you are following. 2. Place the measuring cup on a flat surface: Ensuring the glass measuring cup sits on a level surface is crucial for obtaining an accurate measurement. Place the cup on a counter or table in an area with good lighting, which will aid in reading the measurements correctly. 3. Check and adjust your line of sight: Position your eyes at the same level as the measuring marks on the glass cup. This perspective helps prevent parallax errors that can occur if you view the measurements from an angle above or below the cup. This error typically leads to over- or under-pouring the liquid. 4. Pour the liquid slowly: Begin pouring the liquid into the glass measuring cup, taking care not to overshoot the desired quantity. It is better to pour less at first and then gradually add more if needed. 5. Check the meniscus: As you pour the liquid into the measuring cup, observe its surface. Most liquids, particularly water-based ones, form a slightly curved surface called the meniscus. For an accurate measurement, the bottom of the meniscus should be aligned with the desired marking on the measuring cup. 6. Add more liquid or remove excess if necessary: If you need to add more liquid, do so carefully while keeping your eye level with the measuring mark. If you accidentally pour too much, use a pipette, a clean spoon, or a straw to remove the excess liquid until the meniscus reaches the desired level. 7. Double-check the measurement: Verify your measurement by looking at the meniscus from a different angle to ensure that your initial view was accurate. 8. Transfer the liquid: Once you have confirmed that the measurement is accurate, transfer the liquid from the glass measuring cup to your recipe or container. Pour slowly and steadily, making sure to use a spatula or scraper to get any remaining liquid out of the cup. By following these steps and techniques, you can accurately measure a liquid in a glass measuring cup and ensure that the liquid quantity in your recipe is precise, resulting in a successful and delicious outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

Wochit Papa John's founder and CEO John Schnatter is stepping down. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) Papa John's CEO John Schnatter who overcame the odds to build his home-delivery pizza chain into a national powerhouse against entrenched rivals is stepping down. Schnatter who founded the pizza chain in 1984 will remain as chairman of the board. No immediate reason was given for his decision which takes effect Jan. 1. He is being replaced CEO is company President Steve Ritchie. As the founder Schnatter has been one of the biggest names in fast food. But he recently ran into controversy when he blamed NFL players' mass move to drop to one knee during the playing of the national anthem as affecting his company's sales. Schnatter has been one of the last CEOs who also act as their brand's advertising pitchman a list that once included Col. Harland Sanders for Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dave Thomas of Wendy's. By stressing that Papa John's had better ingredients and a better tasting product he was able to turn the burgeoning chain into a national force against giants like Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut. The company which has more than 5 000 locations worldwide said in a statement that Schnatter will continue to \\"pursue his personal passion for entrepreneurship leadership development and education.\\" Louisville-based Papa John's is the official pizza sponsor of the National Football League which Schnatter slammed in November for not dealing with players who've been kneeling during the Star Spangled Banner to protest racial injustice. The movement began with then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016. \\"The NFL has been a long and valued partner over the years. But we're certainly disappointed that the NFL and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago \\" Schnatter said during a Nov. 1 analyst call. \\"This should've been nipped in the bud a year-and-a-half ago.\\" Schnatter isn't the first founder to step away recently from CEO duties at the company he built from scratch. Last month Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Steve Ells would become executive chairman and Panera Bread's Ron Shaich announced that he would step down but retain his position as board chairman. And Schnatter himself has said goodbye to the CEO gig before. He stepped down in 2005 but returned in 2008. In 2010 he took on a co-CEO Jude Thompson but that arrangement ended the following year. Now Papa John's may decide to find a new pitchman besides Schnatter . â He âs in every ad \\" Gordon said. \\"Thatâs very CEO-centric marketing which is pretty unusual these days. Weâll see if he steps back from that.â He added â He and/or the board see the need to get him out of the line on fire and to continue his involvement in a less visible way.â Output:","completion":"Papa John's CEO John Schnatter Steps Down"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today's forecast follows yesterday's rare treat of sunset views in the city known as \\"Manhattan-henge.\\" Click to see photos. Expand this summary.","completion":"In an unusual turn of events, New York City, along with other major cities such as Philadelphia and Boston, has been placed under a tornado watch until 8 pm, according to NBC New York. This watch also extends to the neighboring counties of Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, and Putnam. These areas are being closely monitored by weather officials, as tornadoes are an infrequent occurrence in these regions, particularly in highly populated urban areas like New York City. The tornado watch has been issued as a result of unusual weather patterns and storm systems moving through the area. Residents are advised to stay informed and prepared for potential severe weather, such as strong winds, heavy rainfall, and even hail. Emergency management and local authorities are closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates and guidance as necessary. The northeastern region has experienced a variety of unusual weather phenomena lately, as evidenced by yesterday's \\"Manhattanhenge,\\" a rare event where the sunset aligns perfectly with the city's east-west street grid, casting beautiful light displays on the streets of Manhattan. Manhattanhenge generally occurs twice a year—around late May and mid-July—and has become a popular event for photographers and astronomy enthusiasts alike. Several photos capturing the stunning views of the sunset in New York City have been circulating on social media and news outlets. In light of these recent meteorological occurrences, the tornado watch raises concerns regarding the safety of residents and the potential for property damage in these densely populated areas. The public is encouraged to stay alert and follow any safety precautions outlined by the National Weather Service and local authorities, such as securing loose outdoor items, staying indoors during severe weather, and having a preparedness plan in place. Although tornadoes are typically associated with the central United States, known as \\"Tornado Alley,\\" they can indeed occur elsewhere in the country. This highlights the importance of understanding and being prepared for severe weather events, even in regions where they are less common. Overall, the tornado watch in New York City and the surrounding areas is a reminder that extreme weather events can occur in unexpected places and warrants vigilance and preparedness from both citizens and officials alike. As the situation develops, it is essential for everyone to stay informed and take any necessary precautions to ensure their own safety and that of their communities."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This is because salt and pepper are common seasonings that help enhance the taste of scrambled eggs, making them more flavorful. Adding mayonnaise to the eggs (option 1) is not the best choice because mayonnaise is not typically used to add flavor to scrambled eggs. Mayonnaise is made from eggs, oil, and vinegar, so it will not make a big difference to the taste, and it can make the texture a bit different.

(CNN) -- Britain's Chris Froome won the 17th stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday to strengthen his grip on the yellow jersey. Froome completed Wednesday's 32-kilometer time trial in 51 minutes 33 seconds, nine seconds ahead of Spain's Alberto Contador with his compatriot Joaquim Rodriguez Oliver finishing a further second behind in third. \\"I couldn't believe it when I got over the line and saw I had the fastest time,\\" Froome said after his third stage win of this year's tour. \\"I went into today thinking I was going to try and limit my losses, thinking about the days to come now. So to go through the finish line with the fastest time, I really didn't see that coming.\\" On mountainous terrain along a frequently twisting route most of the riders opted for their traditional road bikes over the more aerodynamic machines used in time trials. But Froome opted to use both on the stage, switching to a time trial model for the final 12-kilometer descent. The swap proved decisive as the Briton clawed back a 20-second advantage Contador had built up earlier in the stage. The Spaniard now moves up to second overall, four minutes 34 seconds behind Froome with just four stages remaining. Contador's Saxo-Tinkoff teammate Roman Kreuziger is now third and trails Froome by four minutes and 51 seconds. Thursday sees the riders tackle the gruelling 172.5-kilometer 18th stage which concludes with a double ascent of Alpe d'Huez over the last 60 kilometers.

Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who held a position for 33 years? Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune. It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440. Furthermore, when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s. The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily. Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...

Sam places Cale in the care of family friend and guardian Tek (Tone Loc) before explaining that he has to go away for a while. He gives Cale a gold ring and tells him that, as long as he wears it, there will be hope. Then, despite Cale's pleas, Sam is escorted by friend Joseph Korso (Bill Pullman) to a nearby hangar as Cale is brought aboard an evacuation pod with Tek. Reports of Drej fighters attacking civilian pods ring out as Cale's ship takes off. He watches as his father runs inside and activates the Titan Project; a large, spherical ship which manages to fly past the incoming Drej and uses its hyperdrive to vanish into outer space. At a safe distance, Cale watches as the Drej mothership, commanded by the Queen Drej (Christopher Scarabosio), hones in on Earth and destroys it in one shot with a massive energy blast.Fifteen years later, Cale (Christopher Scarabosio) works in a salvage yard in asteroid belt Tau 14.

It is important to note that 1 million represents 10 to the power of 6 (10^6), which means multiplying the number 10 by itself six times (10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10). (2). What is the degree of 1? Is it zero or one? The question appears to be asking about the degree of a polynomial. A polynomial is a mathematical expression involving a sum of terms, each term including a variable raised to a power and multiplied by a coefficient. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable within the polynomial. If the given polynomial is simply \\"1\\" (a constant), it does not contain any variable like x. In this case, the degree of the constant polynomial is considered to be 0. The reason for this is that when you multiply a constant by the variable with the power of 0, the constant remains unchanged. For example, 1 * x^0 = 1 (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1). So, the degree of the polynomial \\"1\\" is 0. (3). Do those questions have the same meaning? No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is related to the numerical representation of a specific number, whereas the second question pertains to the degree of a polynomial in a mathematical context.

Simultaneously, a visa facilitation regime holds significant importance for individuals' lives, as it fortifies connections between people and contributes to materializing the concept of free movement, which is one of the fundamental rights in Europe. Visa facilitation regimes play an essential role in people's lives by fostering stronger relationships between individuals and promoting the idea of free movement – a cornerstone in European fundamental rights. These regimes, primarily designed to simplify and streamline visa application processes, provide vital support for those wishing to visit, work, or study in European countries. The European Union has long been an advocate for free movement, ensuring that citizens within the Schengen Area can travel, live, and work without the need for visas or border checks. Visa facilitation regimes enhance this fundamental right by making it easier for non-EU nationals to experience the benefits of European integration and participate in cultural, economic, and educational exchanges. The impact of visa facilitation regimes on people's lives can be observed through various aspects. Firstly, it increases personal freedom and mobility, enabling individuals to visit friends, family, or simply discover new countries and cultures. By reducing excessive restrictions and allowing for easier travel, people can build stronger connections between nations, ultimately fostering mutual understanding and respect. Secondly, visa facilitation regimes promote economic growth and opportunities, as they attract tourists, investors, and skilled workers to European countries. The increased flow of commerce, investments, and knowledge exchange can bolster various industries, leading to job creation and a more competitive economy. Moreover, the facilitation of visas for students and professionals fosters exchange programs, which can be mutually beneficial for both the individual and the respective countries. Lastly, the ease of visa requirements can contribute to the pursuit and improvement of human rights standards. Visa facilitation allows for more straightforward access to refugees and asylum seekers and can help reunite families separated due to conflict or persecution. Furthermore, it encourages dialogue and cooperation between countries, assisting the promotion of humanitarian values and policies. In conclusion, the importance of visa facilitation regimes should not be underestimated, as they significantly impact many aspects of people's lives. By fostering connections between individuals and countries, spurring economic growth and opportunities, and promoting the protection of fundamental rights, such regimes contribute to the broader European objective of integration, unity, and shared prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: These days, most people in Britain and the US do not wear formal clothes. But sometimes it is important to wear the right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same. You'll feel good if you don't look too different from everyone else. Question: At concerts British business people wear _ .

The graceful Art Nouveau dragon-fly entrances are just the most noticeable on a Metro system which celebrated its 100thanniversary by spending 30 million francs (PS2.9million) on making its stations works of art. On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards. More than anything the metro is efficient. \\"When I worked on line 4\\", says a retired driver, \\"we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay.\\" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges can be tiresome.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on? The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group....
