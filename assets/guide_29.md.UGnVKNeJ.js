Summarize this article: President Obama, clearly angry, let loose on House Republicans in what was, for him, an extraordinary fit of pique Friday night after talks with Speaker John Boehner broke down. President Obama at the White House press room Friday afternoon. \\"One of the questions that the Republican Party's going to have to ask itself is, can they say 'yes' to anything?” Obama said. It was President Obama’s Howard Beale moment: He was mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore. The president had just been informed late Friday afternoon that Republican House Speaker John Boehner was breaking off talks over a deal to enact major deficit reduction and raise the federal debt ceiling. And there is only a week and a half to go until Aug. 2, at which points the US risks a potentially catastrophic default without new borrowing authority. The White House hastily called reporters to the briefing room, and Mr. Obama let 'er rip. “I've been left at the altar now a couple of times,” the steely-eyed president said. “And I think that, you know, one of the questions that the Republican Party's going to have to ask itself is, can they say 'yes' to anything?” “Can they say yes to anything?” he repeated. “I mean, keep in mind it's the Republican Party that has said that the single most important thing facing our country is deficits and debts.” Obama said that he had put forward a package that would significantly cut deficits and debt in a way that does not raise individual tax rates. It is compatible, an exasperated Obama said, with the no-tax pledge that “a whole bunch of these folks signed on to, because we were mindful that they had boxed themselves in.” The challenge, he said, “has to do with the seeming inability, particularly in the House of Representatives, to arrive at any kind of position that compromises any of their ideological preferences – none.” The Democrats had done their part and agreed to compromises that were difficult to swallow, he said. Now it’s the Republicans’ turn. “If you want to be a leader, then you got to lead,” he concluded, then turned and walked briskly from the room. Those are mere highlights from a 30-minute primal scream, the likes of which Washington has not seen from a president known for his near-preternatural calm, both as a candidate and since assuming office. Obama was clearly fed up. And his emotion was authentic. Obama seemed to be demanding the respect due a president of the United States. The Boehner walkout – not his first since debt negotiations began – in fact will be short-lived. Obama called on both parties’ congressional leaders to meet with him at the White House at 11 a.m. Saturday. Mr. Boehner said he would attend. Obama also faces pressure from his own political base, which has expressed frustration that he seems to be doing all the compromising – see cuts to entitlement programs – while the Republicans insist on sticking to their “no new taxes” mantra. A CNN/ORC International Poll released Friday showed Obama’s job approval rating down to 45 percent, in part a result of a decline in liberal support. The president’s approval rating among liberals dropped to 71 percent, a low for his presidency, the poll found. Another data point: 1 in 4 Americans who disapprove of his job performance say he has not been liberal enough. So the president’s show of pique may have been as much aimed at Democrats as at congressional Republicans, whom he needs to believe that he means business. Obama also needs to win back independent voters if he is to win reelection next year. Polls show that independents strongly favor compromise in the debt and deficit talks. ||||| After rarely courting over the previous two years, the pair had an intense summer bromance they’ll never forget: a big outing, frequent dates (albeit with an occasional third wheel), shared secrets, big dreams, their friends cheering them on. But it was promises, promises – all the time promises. Then President Barack Obama began to complain that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) never wants to talk about problems – he just leaves. Boehner stewed that Obama doesn’t know what he really wants, and keeps changing his mind. There were breakups and reconciliations.

To make sure their side of the story got out, both of them went on live TV to spill all the gory details: the betrayals, the dalliances, an ignored phone call, an unhealthy obsession with the base, the failure to deliver at climactic moments. In a 12-paragraph “Dear Colleague” letter to House Republicans after the markets closed, Boehner wrote: “A deal was never reached, and was never really close. In the end, we couldn’t connect. Not because of different personalities, but because of different visions for our country.” Obama was left alone at the altar – scorned, fuming. “Up until sometime early today when I couldn’t get a phone call returned, my expectation was that Speaker Boehner was going to be willing to go to his caucus and ask them to do the tough thing but the right thing,” the president seethed during an epic dinnertime appearance in the White House briefing room. Pressed for details on the phone slight, he rubbed it in: “I’m less concerned about me having to wait for my phone call returned, than I am the message that I received when I actually got the phone call.” The conspiracy theory among some reporters and staffers was that the president and the speaker each knew what they were going to have to cave on at the last moment, and may have even told each other: “Look, this is what I have to say to get my people on board. It’ll help if we look mad at each other. It’ll turn out fine.” If that’s the deal, they should both get Academy Awards. Going before cameras in a yellow tie, just over half an hour after the president, a placid Boehner declared: “The discussions we’ve had with the White House have broken down … [T]he White House moved the goalpost.” Looking down at notes, he continued: “I take the same oath of office as the president of the United States. I’ve got the same responsibilities as the president of the United States. And I think that’s for both of us to do what’s in the best interests of our country. And I can tell you that it’s not in the best interests of our country to raise taxes during this difficult economy.” Concluding his opening statement, he zinged: “I’m confident that the bipartisan leaders here in the Congress can act. If the White House won’t get serious, we will.” In response to the first question, Boehner took a shot by saying that he wasn’t going to take a shot: “Dealing with the White House is like dealing with a bowl of Jell-O. I’m not going to get into the partisan sniping that we heard earlier.” There’s been plenty of theater and posturing, but last evening’s blowup sure looked like the real thing. Republicans don’t like the term “grand bargain,” which has negative connotations with their people. They prefer “big deal.” Whatever you call it, it looks more distant than ever. ||||| The pair had an intense summer bromance and breakup they’ll never forget. | AP Photo The Obama-Boehner breakup After rarely courting over the previous two years, the pair had an intense summer bromance they’ll never forget: a big outing, frequent dates (albeit with an occasional third wheel), shared secrets, big dreams, their friends cheering them on.

In China, I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade. However, I didn't know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say,\\"I am fine\\" when people say \\"How are you?\\" But in the US, I found that people say, \\"I am good\\" or \\"I'm tired\\". One day, someone greeted me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say. Since then, I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures. To my surprise, US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan . However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin paler, or \\"whiter\\". I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are . In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a \\"good\\" student gets good grades, does a lot of work for the public and plays sports or music. The kids here are so talented, I am starting to be sorry that I gave up playing the piano at an early age and that I have never thought about sports.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - The electrical current flows through the wire - The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source - suppose needing smaller electromagnet happens, how will it affect weaker magnetic field. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation caused by needing a smaller electromagnet with a weaker magnetic field can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let me explain this in more detail. Electromagnetism relies on the principle that an electrical current flowing through a conducting metal, like copper, creates a magnetic field around the wire. The strength of this magnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the wire and the number of turns or loops in the coil. In simpler terms, more current and more loops result in a stronger magnetic field, while less current and fewer loops result in a weaker magnetic field. In the given process, when you need a smaller electromagnet, you may have to reduce the size of the coil or decrease the amount of current supplied by the electrical source (like a battery). In both cases, the impact on the magnetic field is indirect, as it affects the parameters that determine the field's strength. Reducing the size of the coil will lead to fewer turns in the wire, which can lead to a weaker magnetic field. The electrical current will still flow through the wire and create a magnetic field, but the strength of the field will be altered due to the change in the coil's size. Decreasing the amount of current supplied by the electrical source will also lead to a weaker magnetic field as a direct consequence of the lesser current flowing through the wire. However, the actual process of generating an electrical current and creating a magnetic field is not directly impacted - it still occurs, just with different input parameters. Thus, the supposed perturbation of needing a smaller electromagnet with a weaker magnetic field is indirectly impacting a step of the process – as it primarily affects the parameters that influence the magnetic field's strength, and not the fundamental mechanisms through which the electromagnet operates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions.

News article: SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Tesla Motors shares shot nearly 41% higher Tuesday in their first day of trade, an enthusiastic reception for the Silicon Valley electric car marker in sharp contrast to steep declines elsewhere in the equities market. The stock opened at 19 a share, 12% above the 17 offer price. After briefly pulling back to 17.54, it staged a full-blown rally that carried it briefly to 25 a share. Tesla /quotes/comstock/15*!tsla/quotes/nls/tsla (TSLA 21.96, -1.87, -7.85%) shares closed at 23.89, an advance of 6.89, or 40.5%, in a session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/comstock/10w!i:dji/delayed (DJIA 9,733, -41.49, -0.42%) fall more than 268 points to 9,870. Tesla IPO prices above estimates Shares of Tesla Motors open higher after the initial public offering priced above expectations. With a relatively small dealer network and a high price point for its electric cars, should investors be concerned about the company's business model? VentureWire's Scott Austin joins Simon Constable and Lauren Goode on the Digits show to discuss. Tesla, the first American car maker to go public in half a century, priced the deal one dollar above the initial offer price of 14 to 16 a share. The maker of the Roadster sports car raised 202 million from the sale of 11.88 million shares. Insiders, including 38-year-old Chief Executive Elon Musk, collectively sold an additional 1.4 million shares in the deal. Musk reaped an IPO payday of 15.3 million based on the 900,212 shares he sold, according to a regulatory filing. Tesla on Monday boosted the share offering by 20% to 13.3 million shares due to strong demand. The company's selling shareholders granted the deal underwriters a 30-day option to buy an additional 1.995 million common shares to cover any overallotments. In all, the IPO could be worth 260 million. For some, Tesla's IPO harkens back to Silicon Valley's Internet bubble in the late 1990s, when retail investors snapped up shares in brand-new tech companies with no track record of making any money. Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of IPO Boutique, which profited Tuesday from flipping Tesla shares in opening trades, believes the stock faces an uphill battle. He pointed to last September's IPO of A123 Systems Inc., a maker of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid vehicles. A123 /quotes/comstock/15*!aone/quotes/nls/aone (AONE 9.12, -0.31, -3.29%) shares spiked on their first day of trading, but the stock has now fallen 27% from its 13.50 offer price. \\"There are enough problems with the financials,\\" Sweet said of Tesla. \\"The euphoria will likely fade soon given the cost of this vehicle in the recessionary environment. There is a very limited market for Tesla's cars.\\" NAIAS Tesla has yet to earn a dime since it was founded by Musk and Chief Technical Officer J.B. Straubel in 2003. The company has lost almost 300 million since inception, and does not expect to make a quarterly profit until at least 2012. \\"The investment is a risk for investors, but some risks pay off,\\" said Edmunds.com Chief Executive Jeremy Anwyl. \\"Even if this doesn't turn out well for investors, it's good for the country that Tesla has gotten so much attention for its innovative efforts.\\" Tesla is hoping to tap growing interest from consumers and governments for hybrid and electric vehicles in an era of high oil prices and concerns about the impact of gas-fueled cars on the environment. The U.S. government wants to put 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 and offers consumer tax credits of up to 7,500 per alternative-fuel vehicle. Read MarketWatch First Take on Tesla's believers. Tesla's top-end Roadster, which sells for more than 100,000, has attracted attention from Hollywood's \\"A-list\\" stars, among other movers and shakers, and the U.S. Energy Department has backed it with a 465 million loan. But the company is pinning hopes of future profits on sales of a mass-market Model S sedan. The Model S carries a price tag of 50,000, after a federal tax credit. So far, 2,200 would-be buyers have plunked down a 5,000 refundable deposit for the five-passenger car. Volume production of the Model S is slated to begin in 2012 at a recently shuttered Northern California auto plant it bought from Toyota Motor Corp. /quotes/comstock/13*!tm/quotes/nls/tm (TM 68.70, +0.13, +0.19%) for 42 million. Tesla is selling 50 million in shares to Toyota immediately after the IPO as part of a broader partnership with the Japanese auto maker. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Tesla has 646 employees. It plans to expand its network of 12 retail showrooms in the United States and Europe to 50 worldwide to accommodate its rollout of the Model S. On Thursday, Tesla will open a showroom in Copenhagen. Tesla's Musk has had success in the past with startups. The executive founded Tesla after helping launch PayPal, an electronic-payment system acquired by eBay Inc. /quotes/comstock/15*!ebay/quotes/nls/ebay (EBAY 19.64, +0.03, +0.15%) in 2002, and Zip2 Corp., a provider of Internet-enterprise software that was acquired by Compaq in 1999. Musk, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, intends to emerge from the IPO with a 28% stake in Tesla. Matt Andrejczak is a reporter for MarketWatch in San Francisco. ||||| Since its founding in 2003, luxury automaker Tesla Motors has never turned a profit. Its charismatic founder recently ran out of cash. It has sold fewer than 1,500 vehicles. Yet in a burst of enthusiasm for electric cars, investors are saluting the company's prospects, raising more than 200 million at its initial public offering Monday and, on its first day of trading Tuesday, sending share prices up again from 17 to 23.89. Co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk said the enthusiasts were making a smart bet. \\"We had an incredibly positive outcome from the smartest investors in the world,\\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \\"When people look at the list of the investors . . . they will be amazed at the quality and strength of the investor group in Tesla.\\" The outcome, indirectly, amounts to a small measure of private-sector validation for Congress and the Obama administration, which has invested billions of government dollars in electric-car technology, including a 465 million loan commitment to Tesla. But as lawmakers weigh bills that would bolster the electric-car industry with 10 billion more in consumer incentives and other support, industry observers remain divided over whether the technology will be commercially viable soon, and whether this is the right time for the government to get involved. Chevrolet and Nissan are expected to roll out electric cars for sale this year. The Tesla stock offering \\"is a good sign that people believe electric vehicles have potential,\\" said Robbie Diamond, president of the Electrification Coalition. The group is lobbying for more than 100 billion in long-term government support that would give consumers thousands of dollars in incentives to purchase an electric vehicle. Without subsidies, electric cars are unlikely to attract many buyers because they are more expensive than their conventional counterparts. The coalition's plan also calls for the government to subsidize the development of charging stations, where travelers would plug in. \\"The government really does have to be involved,\\" Diamond said. \\"The government needs to get serious about working in this industry or electric cars will be relegated to a niche market and not solve our oil dependence problem.\\" He notes that despite some government support, hybrid vehicles make up only about 1.6 million of the roughly 250 millions cars on the nation's roads. Others said past government efforts to subsidize alternative energies have yielded little. \\"The attempt to subsidize our way out of this problem has a 35-year track record of failure,\\" said John DeCicco, senior lecturer at the University of Michigan and a former senior fellow for automotive strategies at the Environmental Defense Fund. He said that synthetic fuels were hyped during the Carter administration, that the Clinton administration pushed the \\"Supercar,\\" which was supposed to triple mileage, and that the Bush administration promoted a hydrogen-fueled vehicle dubbed the \\"Freedom Car.\\" DeCicco backs government subsidies for research and development in alternative fuels, but he said subsidizing production and sales of vehicles is a \\"dubious proposition.\\" Bills with bipartisan support now in Congress would, among other things, offer incentives of as much as 10,000 to consumers who buy electric cars, as well as provide support for building charging stations and other infrastructure. Existing law gives consumers a 7,500 tax credit for their purchase. Such credits would only make a small dent in the price of Tesla's Roadster, which sells for more than 100,000 and has attracted buyers such as George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf are expected to be far less expensive -- the Leaf price tag is 32,780. Tesla's next car is supposed to be less costly, projected to run about 50,000. Regardless, the boost from investors led Musk on Tuesday to take a jab at skeptics of the company into which he has poured millions of dollars made from his previous company, PayPal. \\"People at this point ought to be a little bit more optimistic about the future of Tesla because we've confounded the critics at every turn,\\" Musk said. \\"At a certain point, people have to get tired of being wrong.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Tesla Motors, a company that makes electric cars, had a very good first day of selling their shares to the public. Even though the company has not made a profit yet and has only sold a small number of cars, people are excited about electric cars and their potential for the future.

Write a title for this article: The Leadership Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in business contribute answers to timely questions about careers and leadership. Today’s answer to the question: How do you keep your team motivated? is written by ‎Daniel Saks, co-CEO and co-founder of AppDirect. Whether you feel the pull toward the Dark Side or the Light—or don’t really get the fuss about the Force to begin with—it’s hard to ignore the Star Wars mania that has swept the globe. Count me as one of those millions of happy movie-goers. But, I didn’t like The Force Awakens just because it has all of the lightsaber battles and star fighter action that any die-hard fan could ask for. As a startup co-founder and co-CEO, I also think the movie offers important lessons for anyone looking to build a strong workplace culture. No really. Hear me out. You can stretch and make all kinds of cute comparisons between Star Wars and the business world. Your competitor is the evil First Order (or Empire, if you’re keeping things old school), controlled by ruthless villains who will stop at nothing to crush you. Your company is the Resistance, who, with a well-aimed product, er, blast from an X-wing fighter can destroy your competitor’s Starkiller Base (or Death Star). Okay, eye-rolling aside, maybe this is true, but I’m more interested in the human side of the saga. Star Wars has always been about people facing huge challenges and not being entirely sure how to overcome them. The adventure is figuring it out along the way, and The Force Awakens shows just how powerful having a solid set of core values to guide you can be. See also: 6 Things That Will Make You Work Harder It’s an idea that leapt out at me when I saw the movie (and not because I was at a 3D showing). When we started AppDirect, we founded the company on a set of values that guide everything we do. They’re uncannily similar to what you see in The Force Awakens, which doesn’t surprise me. Our values have allowed AppDirect to build a strong workplace culture that has helped us do some awesome things, and they help the movies’ heroes achieve some pretty amazing things, too. With that in mind, here are four of the biggest team-building lessons from Star Wars. Stay humble After teaming up to ditch some TIE fighters in an early chase scene, Rey and Finn (played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, respectively) burst with compliments for each other. Their humility is a refreshing departure from the typical action hero—or coworker—who steps in, tries to fix things, and never gives credit to anyone. These compliments seal their friendship, and they can go a long way toward building rapport at work. Take ownership When BB-8 rolls up to Rey’s makeshift home, no one tells her she has to help the droid complete its mission. But, she takes ownership and does anyway (with incredible results). Sometimes work projects don’t have a clear owner either; if you step up and take responsibility for a project—or, like Rey, ensure that it gets handed off to the right person—you’ll not only earn the respect of your team, but also drive results for your company. Have a positive attitude Finn is accused of running away from problems, but he’s actually always trying to solve them. He may not know exactly how to rescue Rey from the Starkiller Base, but he keeps on talking, trying to get to something that will work. When you run into obstacles at work, a steady stream of ideas and new approaches are the only way to overcome them. In the end, you may not use any of your ideas—in one of the movie’s best moments, Finn turns around to see that Rey has already figured out her own rescue—but the key is to keep trying. Be intense Okay, so you can roll your eyes a little at this one (blame the screenwriters, not me!), but it is true that it takes a lot of intensity to make a hyperspace jump to a planet-sized weapon, dismantle its shields, and take out its thermal oscillator—all in about 15 minutes—but that’s just what the Resistance does. Back here on Earth, there are numerous distractions, big and small, that can get in the way at work. Making a conscious effort to move fast and stay focused will go a long way toward helping your team achieve its goals. Sure, the challenges of starting or growing a business may seem a little less… galactic in scale, but they can still feel monumental to the team that’s striving to build a successful company. Many businesses have values and mission statements, but the key is making sure your values surround you, flow through you, and bind your company together (hey, that sounds a lot like the Force). As you build a team that can take on any challenge, may these values—whatever you decide they should be—be with you.

They were both very surprised with they findings. Which scientist read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the scientist who read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest would be Jian. This is because Jian was focused on studying grassland soil, while Yun was studying forest soils. Given the hint, we know that tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems, while grass root systems contribute significantly to organic matter in grassland soil. Moreover, different environmental factors like forest fires in grasslands and higher acidity in forests also impact the distribution of organic matter in these ecosystems. By analyzing the differences between the two types of soils, it becomes apparent why each scientist might have been surprised by their findings; they discovered variations in the characteristics of soil organic matter between forests and grasslands, which would not have been as evident if they had only studied one type of ecosystem. These findings would have highlighted the differences in soil formation, development, and processes dictated by the unique characteristics of each ecosystem and the relative importance of various sources of organic matter. In conclusion, Jian would be the scientist who read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in forests since he focused on grassland soil. On the other hand, Yun would have likely had a deeper understanding of forest soil organic matter inputs and distribution due to her focus on studying forest soils exclusively. Both scientists were able to contribute valuable insights into the relationship between soil and different ecosystems, demonstrating the importance of studying soil properties and processes in varied environments to broaden our understanding of soil as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps.

Answer the following question: Process: - Water gets into cracks in rocks - The water freezes into ice - The cracks expand - Over time the rocks split - The rocks are now in smaller pieces. suppose more solid rock happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"In the described process of water freezing in the rock cracks, causing them to expand and eventually split, the presence of more solid rock could potentially affect the rate of weathering in different ways. Before I answer the question regarding the supposed perturbation, let's examine the possible ways more solid rock could influence this process: 1. More surface area for water to enter: If there is more solid rock, it means there are more cracks and surfaces for water to infiltrate. This could lead to more weathering occurring, as there are more potential sites for the freeze-thaw process. 2. Increased resistance to weathering: On the other hand, more solid rock can also mean that the rocks are denser or more resistant to weathering, which could slow down the rate at which the cracks expand and the rocks split. Now, let's consider which of the following perturbation types best fits the given scenario: - Directly impacting a step of the process: Since the presence of more solid rock can affect the availability of cracks and surfaces for water to enter and influence the rate of the freeze-thaw process, it can be considered as directly impacting a step of the process. Specifically, it might influence the first two steps: water getting into cracks in rocks and water freezing into ice. - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: While not directly a part of the process, the effect of more solid rock could also be considered as indirectly impacting weathering. If denser rock slows down the cracking process, it's an indirect factor shaping the rate at which weathering occurs. - Not impacting any step of the process: It's unlikely that more solid rock will not impact any step of the process at all, considering that density, resistance, and surface area of the rock play a role in weathering. Answer: Given the analysis above, the supposed perturbation on the process of weathering caused by an increase in solid rock would best be described as directly impacting a step of the process. However, in some cases, it might also indirectly impact weathering, depending on the resistance and composition of the rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The few remaining scientists work tirelessly to develop an antidote, but their efforts seem to be in vain. All hope seems lost until one day, two young scientists, Julia and Ryan, stumble upon the formula for a potential cure. Act 1: - The Black Spore has devastated countries and taken millions of lives. Governments have collapsed, and chaos reigns supreme. - The global scientific community is racing against time to find a cure. Two introverted and dedicated scientists, Julia and Ryan, are secretly researching the antidote in a hidden laboratory. - Julia and Ryan work together and start growing closer, as they share their grief and loss. They both lost their families to the pandemic and are hell-bent on finding the cure. - Amidst sleepless nights, old notes, and experimental algorithms, they discover a possible cure. Act 2: - Julia and Ryan, realizing they are not part of a government-sanctioned lab, decide to keep their discovery a secret and focus on creating the antidote. - They manage to develop only two vials of the antidote, as the essential ingredients are extremely rare and hard to acquire. - News of the antidote leaks out to a power-hungry warlord who wants to obtain it for himself to ensure his own survival and to control the remaining human population. - Julia and Ryan, who already tested the antidote on themselves and know its effectiveness, now face the challenge of protecting the antidote and finding a way to mass-produce it for the greater good. Act 3: - The warlord launches a full-scale attack on Julia and Ryan's hidden lab, intending to take the last two vials by force. - In the heat of the battle, Julia and Ryan manage to send a message to a secret network of resistance fighters who pledge to help them keep the antidote from falling into the wrong hands. - The climax of the story is a thrilling chase and showdown between the heroes and the warlord's forces, with Julia and Ryan doing everything they can to protect the last two vials. - Eventually, the warlord is defeated, and the evil plan is thwarted, but not without significant sacrifices from both Julia and Ryan. Conclusion: - With the defeat of the warlord, Julia and Ryan finally have the opportunity to work on mass-producing the antidote. - Thanks to their sacrifice and determination, the world starts to heal, and the remnants of humanity begin to rebuild their lives and the planet. - Julia and Ryan's love for each other grows stronger, and now their mission is to ensure the revival of human civilization. They vow to dedicate their lives to finding a way to create more of the antidote and give hope back to the world.

CB&L is for YOU! My girlfriends and I were in dire need of some appetizers, and we happened to stumble past Caramel Bar & Lounge (and by stumble I don't mean in a drunken stupor, we weren't at that phase yet). So, we said hello to the host standing outside of the lounge as we read the appetizer list. Sounds good to us! So we walk in and get seated. Nice place! Total lounge feel, great ambiance. That is, until our experience turned sour. We asked for a couple items off their appetizer list and some water for two of us. We were then told that they aren't serving food as it was 9:17, just minutes after they stop cooking. Bummer. How about removing the appetizer list placed outside that draws in the crowd? So we disappointingly said water is fine, while we make our drink selection. The waitress, who looked underaged and under-experienced, arrives back with two 11 oz bottles of Fiji water for each of us. We then order our alcohol beverages - 2 vodka/redbulls and one jack/coke. Check is given.... wait for it... waiiiiiit for it.... 71.00. Whoa! Really? We questioned it and assumed it had to be an error. So the waitress checks on it and comes back to confirm it is in fact correct, that the waters were each 10 and the drinks averaged 18 a piece. Wow. I might sound cheap, but 10 for a bottle that small should come with a happy ending of some sort. I finished the water pretty quickly... in a gulp practically, since there wasn't much to begin with. My girlfriend had hers down about 75% while she sipped on her alcohol. Suddenly one of the staff members picks it up from the table and threw her water bottle away, without asking if she was finished!! He just threw away dollars that we had spent! We told him his error, he apologized and talked to his manager about getting a new one. So 5 minutes later the waitress comes by with a BELLAGIO bottle of water that looked like it was meant for a 2 year old. You know, what comes out of their faucets probably. At this point we're thinking: A) If Fiji isn't worth 10, neither is your faucet water B) If you had Bellagio water, why didn't you bring THAT the first time?! Explaining that we weren't going to accept a substitute for water that they had thrown away at our expense, she gets her manager who comes by, drops off a new bottle of Fiji water without saying a word and just leaves. No apology, nothing! How the HECK do you get in management being a complete d*** like that?! Please tell me, because if I treated my customers that way, I would have been fired yesterday!

Write some highlights for the following article: More than half of all adult Americans say they don't want to get the H1N1 flu vaccine, according to a new national poll. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Wednesday also indicates that the number of adults who have tried to get the vaccine but were turned away is higher than the number of adults who have gotten a swine flu shot. According to the poll, 55 percent of adults don't want to get the swine flu vaccine and don't plan to get a shot. Another one in five say they want to get inoculated but haven't taken any steps to do so; 14 percent want a shot and have tried to get it but have been unsuccessful. Just 7 percent have been inoculated for H1N1. Why are more than half of all Americans shunning the vaccine? \\"The perception that the vaccine has dangerous side effects is the top reason,\\" says CNN polling director Keating Holland. \\"Roughly half of those who don't want a swine flu shot say that the possibility of side effects is one reason why they don't plan to get the vaccine. That works out to 28 percent of the adult population who don't plan to get inoculated due to the risk of dangerous side effects.\\" So far officials of the National Institutes of Health say they've seen no serious side effects in clinical trials and that study subjects who have been immunized have generated a good response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for certain high-priority groups because they are more likely to have serious complications if they develop swine flu. These groups include: pregnant women; caregivers and household contacts of children younger than 6 months; everyone between the ages of 6 months and 24 years; and people ages 25 to 64 with existing health problems. Most frequently asked H1N1 questions. One in four American adults say they don't plan on getting a shot because they are not in a high-risk group, with 21 percent indicating they don't plan on getting vaccinated because they only go to a doctor when they are sick. Most of those respondents are men. What about the 14 percent who have unsuccessfully tried to get the vaccine? \\"Some say they don't know where to go. That works out to 4 percent of the total adult population who want to get inoculated but haven't been able to locate a medical facility that is giving swine flu shots,\\" Holland said. \\"A bigger group, 5 percent of the total population, say that they found a facility with the vaccine but were turned away because they were not in a high-risk group or for some other reason. And 3 percent of all adults say they found a facility that had the vaccine but it ran out before they got there.\\" Add together those last two groups, and the number of Americans who actively sought the vaccine but were turned away for some reason is 8 percent of the total adult population, roughly the same number as the 7 percent who have been inoculated so far. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN deputy political director Paul Steinhauser and senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report. Highlights:","completion":"1. A new national survey by CNN/Opinion Research Corporation shows that over half of the adult Americans (55%) do not wish to get the H1N1 flu vaccine. 2. The survey also found that a higher number of adults who attempted to get the vaccine were turned away than the number of adults who have received a swine flu shot. 3. Approximately 20% of adults want to get immunized but have not taken the necessary steps to do so, while 14% have tried but were unsuccessful in getting the shot. 4. The major reason behind the reluctance to get the vaccine is the fear of dangerous side effects, which accounted for roughly half of those who refuse to get the swine flu shot. This equates to about 28% of the adult population who are not preparing to get the vaccine due to the risk of side effects. 5. On the positive side, officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have reported no serious side effects from the vaccine in the clinical trials. 6. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the vaccine for high-risk groups, including pregnant women, caregivers and household contacts of children under six months of age, individuals aged between six months and 24 years, and those aged 25 to 64 with existing health problems. 7. One in four American adults say they don't intend on getting the vaccine as they don't belong to a high-risk group, with 21% opting out due to their practice of only visiting a doctor when ill, a sentiment mostly expressed by men. 8. Among the 14% who have tried to get a vaccine but were unsuccessful, 4% were unable to find a facility providing the swine flu shots while 3% unfortunately found a facility but the vaccine was exhausted before they got there. 9. Around 5% found a facility but were turned away for not being in a high-risk group or due to other reasons. Adding the last two groups makes it 8% of the total adult population who actively sought the vaccine but were turned away for some reason. 10.

The same is true if they have competitors you cannot easily understand. Any time that you're not able to decipher the purpose, mission or actions of a company (or those of its nearest competition), that should be a warning sign to you as an investor. To think like Warren Buffet and make strategic investment decisions, it is vital to understand the importance of investing in fundamentally strong companies with transparent goals (Option IV). Companies that operate in industries with strong profit potential, possess a competitive edge, and exhibit clear and easily understandable business strategies are more likely to succeed in the long term, creating wealth for shareholders. On the other hand, it is crucial to avoid investments in industries with low profit margins, as these sectors may not provide sufficient returns to justify the risks associated with investing in them. Moreover, companies with opaque strategies and unclear goals may experience operational difficulties and financial instability, ultimately leading to poor investment performance. By avoiding such investments, investors can minimize potential losses and maximize returns on their portfolios. In order to adopt Warren Buffet's investment strategies, focus on the quality and business fundamentals of the companies you intend to invest in, rather than attempting to predict short-term market fluctuations. This long-term, value-oriented approach to investing has proven to be highly successful for Buffet, and it can serve as an excellent guide for individual investors seeking to emulate his success. In conclusion, to think like Warren Buffet, it is essential to invest in companies with transparent strategies and strong long-term prospects while avoiding those in low-profit industries or with unclear goals. This approach helps in making well-informed investment decisions that minimize risks and provide opportunities for significant returns over time."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Grapes were in the blue_treasure_chest when Logan entered the sunroom. The question asked about the initial location of the grapes without considering any individual's beliefs. Therefore, I answered that the grapes were in the blue_treasure_chest at the beginning. 4. Ella exited the garage before the apple was moved from the blue_box to the green_drawer by Sophia.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What does Jesus mention in the New Testament?, using the article: Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick. Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories includes the story of \\"How the Whale got in his Throat\\". Niki Caro's film the Whale Rider has a Māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship.

He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools.

So, when you combine these two words, you get the Turkish translation of \\"His message was clear\\" as \\"Mesajı açıktı.\\" Turkish is an agglutinative language, which means that words are often formed by adding multiple affixes to a root word.

When he was gunning for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Florida, the former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives aggressively courted the state's conservative Tea Party activists. That strategy worked. Rubio was suddenly a Tea Party favorite. His stunning rise in the polls forced Florida's more moderate governor, Charlie Crist, to bolt the GOP primary to run as an independent. But the race is now more complicated, with Rubio competing in a three-way battle royal against both Crist and the Democratic nominee, South Florida Rep.

This article: During the 1950s, Szigeti began to develop arthritis in his hands and his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for \\"Long live Hungary!\\"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that \\"Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed\\".Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness. He died in Lucerne, Switzerland on February 19, 1973, at the age of 80. The New York Times ran a front-page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist Yehudi Menuhin: We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos, aristocrats as human beings and as musicians, has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had weakened technical mastery?, what is it ?

Please answer the following question: Q: Some sea anemones establish what kind of relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab’s shell? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. The slit-like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore. The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity. This cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries. Each mesentery consists of one ectodermal and one endodermal cell layer with the mesoglea sandwiched in between. Mesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. The adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange. Sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey using the cnidocytes. Some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab’s shell. In this relationship, the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone. Anemone fish, or clownfish, are able to live in the anemone since they are immune to the toxins contained within the nematocysts. Anthozoans remain polypoid throughout their lives and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes. Both gametes are produced by the polyp, which can fuse to give rise to a free-swimming planula larva. The larva settles on a suitable substratum and develops into a sessile polyp.

Screengrabs: Sky Sports The Decision Review System was again under the spotlight after the opening morning of the third Ashes Test at Emirates Old Trafford. Australia reached lunch at 92 for two but were left aggrieved after Usman Khawaja was given out by the third umpire, Kumar Dharmasena, caught behind off Graeme Swann. Khawaja almost immediately reviewed the decision by Tony Hill, the on-field umpire, to give him out and the Hot Spot technology appeared to back him up with no mark on the bat. Dharmasena saw differently though, upholding the on-field call after a lengthy delay, in a decision branded \\"shocking and ridiculous\\" by Shane Warne in the Sky commentary. \\"There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no Hot Spot and no noise,\\" the former Australia leg-spinner said. \\"The only noise was when the bat hit his pad. That's a shocker, that's an absolute shocking decision. You can see the bat hitting the pad, the ball goes past, no noise. There was clear evidence there as well. That is a ridiculous decision.\\" I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen. KRudd Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, tweeted his reaction: \\"I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen.\\" The incident overshadowed Chris Rogers' progress to a career-best unbeaten 67, during which time the 35-year-old opener also passed 20,000 first-class runs. England were unable to make a breakthrough in the opening hour as Australia made chanceless progress to 47 without loss. After Michael Clarke elected to bat after winning the toss the England bowlers did find some early movement. Stuart Broad snaked the ball past Shane Watson's defences from consecutive deliveries while Rogers squirted a couple of boundaries away backward of point. Rogers was surprisingly the more fluid of the openers and produced the shot of the first hour when he pushed James Anderson through a vacant mid-off for four. England attempted to coerce an uncharacteristically circumspect Watson out of his shell with the opener loosely driving at a wide-ish Broad ball just short of point. As the opening stand passed 50 England skipper Alastair Cook swung Anderson around to the Statham End, but Rogers greeted the move with three fours from the over to reach his half-century from 49 balls. England got the breakthrough in the 17th over when Tim Bresnan found just enough seam movement to find Watson's edge as he pressed forward. Alastair Cook pouched the simple chance at first slip but the controversy of the morning soon followed. And people say you should Walk .... No chance when you get decisions like that.... #Ashes Khawaja played his part in his downfall, thrashing needlessly at a wide ball that turned further from Swann, but he appeared to have reason to feel aggrieved after the Hot Spot replay appeared to show he did not hit the ball. Dharmasena watched over the visual images more intently, however, before sending the batsmen on his way to prompt condemnation from not only Warne but also former England skipper Michael Vaughan, who tweeted: \\"And people say you should Walk … No chance when you get decisions like that … #Ashes\\".

The Saga is separated into two trilogies bridged by a single book, \\"Mortalis\\". The saga has an accompanying roleplaying game, entitled \\"Demon Wars\\". - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - A fantasy world is a fictional universe created in fiction media, such as literature, film or games. Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology and sometimes, either an historical or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. - A fictional universe is a self-consistent imaginary setting with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Caldey Island, a small island spanning about 1.5 miles long and 1 mile wide, is situated approximately 2.5 miles off the Pembrokeshire coast in South Wales, UK. The island is well-known for its monastic history and religious significance dating back to the 6th century. Visitors to the island are often drawn by its natural beauty, idyllic sandy beaches, and the tranquility it offers, in addition to its religious sites. The religious community on Caldey Island was first established by Celtic monks in the 6th century. Owing to the Viking invasions, the monastery was abandoned for a short period in the late 10th century. With the Norman Conquest in the 11th century, the island’s monastery was reoccupied, and the foundation of an Augustinian priory was laid. However, the best-known religious community on Caldey Island is the Cistercian Order, which arrived there in the early 20th century. The Cistercian monks constructed an impressive Italian-inspired monastery, known as the Caldey Abbey, in 1910. The present monastery on Caldey Island is home to a community of Silent Order Trappist monks with a vow of stability. They adhere to a life of monastic silence, work, and prayer. Apart from being a site of spiritual interest, Caldey Island is also renowned for its wildlife and natural beauty, making it a popular destination for tourists and day-trippers. Visitors to the island can appreciate its peaceful atmosphere, explore the monastery, visit the lighthouse, or simply take a relaxing stroll along the serene beaches. Additionally, Caldey Island is known for its unique flora and fauna, with the presence of rare species such as grey seals and seabirds. In summary, Caldey Island is a captivating destination lying off the coast of South Wales, opposite the beautiful town of Tenby. The island is home to a monastery dating back centuries, with a rich religious history, as well as a popular attraction for visitors seeking tranquility and natural beauty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If the population continues to grow at the same rate, there will be 25 billion in the world a hundred years from now. Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up. Now many people believe that man's greatest problem is how to control the growth of the population. The material supplies in the world will be far from enough to support the human population in time to come, if the present rate of increase continues. Already there is overcrowding in many cities and starvation in some countries. Should man's population keep on growing so rapidly as before? Many people believe that human survival in the future depends on the answer to this question.

It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it?

Court questions overturning of Marine conviction CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. – The military's highest court is questioning last year's ruling by an appeals court that threw out the murder conviction against a Camp Pendleton Marine in the killing of an unarmed Iraqi man. In a ruling late Tuesday, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in Washington agreed there were errors at the trial of Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III but they may not have been enough to overturn his conviction. Hutchins was released last June after the military appeals court ruled he had an unfair trial in 2007 because his lead defense attorney was let go three weeks before the start of his trial. Tuesday's ruling opens the possibility that his conviction could be reinstated. Hutchins spent four years in a military prison for the killing of a retired Iraqi policeman in 2006 in the village of Hamdania. Authorities say the 52-year-old man was dragged from his home and shot by Marines who then framed him as an insurgent. Six other Marines and a Navy corpsman were convicted or pleaded guilty in the killing. Hutchins' attorney, Capt. Babu Kaza, says the case against his client is without merit. He said he will file a motion asking the higher court to reconsider sending the case back to the lower court. If the conviction is reinstated, Kaza said they will appeal. Hutchins is currently stationed at Camp Pendleton, where he is not under any restrictions. After Tuesday's ruling, Hutchins sent an e-mail to his family telling them about the decision and telling them he was hopeful still that his conviction will not be reinstated. \\"I look at the last eight months as a blessing,\\" he said in the e-mail, made public by his defense attorney. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is revisiting the case of Sgt.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation 116*c = 121*c + 41 - 16 for c, we will first simplify the equation and then isolate the variable c. Here's a step-by-step solution: Step 1: Simplify the equation. The given equation is: 116*c = 121*c + 41 - 16. We can simplify the right-hand side by subtracting 16 from 41: 116*c = 121*c + 25 Step 2: Move all the terms involving c to one side. Now, we will isolate c by moving all terms with c to one side of the equation. Let's subtract 116*c from both sides: 116*c - 116*c = 121*c - 116*c + 25 This simplifies to: 0 = 5*c + 25 Step 3: Isolate the variable c. Now, we want to isolate c. We will first get rid of the constant term '25' by subtracting 25 from both sides: 0 - 25 = 5*c + 25 - 25 -25 = 5*c Now, we'll divide both sides by 5 to completely isolate c: -25 / 5 = 5*c / 5 -5 = c The solution to the equation 116*c = 121*c + 41 - 16 is c = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - gliding - hinge - ball and socket - pivot joint A: Answer:","completion":"The name of a joint in which one bone rotates in relation to another bone is the pivot joint. A pivot joint, also known as a rotary joint, permits rotation movements around a central axis. It is a type of synovial joint that allows for a wide range of motion while still providing stability and security to the skeletal structure. In a pivot joint, one bone has a cylindrical or circular region, called the pivot, that rotates within a ring-shaped structure formed by the other bone, along with a ligament or membrane. One of the most well-known examples of a pivot joint is the atlanto-axial joint, located between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) vertebrae in the neck. This joint allows for the rotation of the head from side to side, as when gesturing \\"no\\" or shaking the head. Another example is the proximal radioulnar joint, which enables rotation of the radius around the ulna in the forearm, allowing the hand to be placed in positions such as pronation (palm down) and supination (palm up). In contrast, the other types of joints mentioned in the choices have different functions: 1) Gliding joints, also known as plane joints, allow bones to slide or glide past one another in various directions. This type of joint provides limited mobility and is found in areas such as the wrist, ankle, and certain joints of the spinal column (facet joints between vertebrae). 2) Hinge joints allow for movement in a single plane, similar to a door hinge. These joints consist of a convex surface of one bone fitting into the concave surface of another, permitting only flexion and extension. Examples of hinge joints include the elbow, knee, fingers, and toes. 3) Ball and socket joints possess the greatest range of motion and are characterized by a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into the concave socket of another bone. These joints allow for movement in multiple planes, providing flexibility and stability, like the shoulder and hip joints. In conclusion, the pivot joint is the joint type in which one bone rotates in relation to another bone, allowing for rotation movements around a central axis. This joint type is essential for movements such as head rotation or hand positioning, and it distinguishes itself from gliding, hinge, and ball and socket joints by its unique structure and function."},{"prompt":"- The virus finds an animal cell - The virus attaches to the cell's surface - The cell swallows the virus - The virus' RNA is released into the cell - The cell mistakenly reads the virus' RNA instead of its own - The cell creates new viruses - The animal cell releases the new viruses What might be the last step of the process?

Write an article based on this summary: An Indian television journalist who reported on deadly floods while sitting on the shoulders of a survivor has been sacked, says the channel he worked for.","completion":"Title: \\"Indian Television Journalist Sacked for Unprofessional Conduct Amidst Deadly Floods\\" A wave of controversy has crashed upon the world of Indian journalism, resulting in the dismissal of an erstwhile popular television reporter. This event followed a public outcry after the journalist reported on the devastating floods in the region while perched on the shoulders of a flood survivor. According to the news channel, this inappropriate conduct and lack of sensitivity led to his termination. To provide context, the incident came to light when the reporter's news segment covering the disastrous floods in the country aired. In the midst of the devastation, the reporter chose an unusual vantage point for his report, namely, the shoulders of a victim of the floods. This glaring unprofessionalism sparked widespread criticism from the public and media fraternity alike, leading to the necessary punitive action imposed by the channel. The decision to terminate the journalist was justified by the channel as a response to his insensitive and irresponsible actions, which showcased a stark absence of empathy towards the disaster victims. At a time when humanity grapples with nature's wrath, it is the duty of every reporter to cover the situation professionally and ethically. It is press ethics to ensure that the dignity and respect of disaster victims are held high, which the sacked reporter seemingly overlooked. In his defense, the journalist claimed to be providing viewers a clear picture of the deluge's severity. However, his argument was overshadowed due to his lack of professional conduct. It became a question not only of professional guidelines but also moral values. The journalist's modus operandi raised serious questions about his empathy towards the victims, teetering on the edge of objectifying the victim for the sake of news. This incident brings to light the need for ethical journalism. Reporters must endeavor to deliver accurate and vital information, without losing sight of their social responsibilities. The individuals who bear the brunt of unforeseen tragedies like floods require empathy and understanding, not to be used as mere columns for aiding news reports. The channel's decision to sack the reporter signifies the gravity of professional and ethical violations. Ethics and professionalism must be the guiding principles of journalism and this incident serves as a stern reminder of it. This sacking emphasizes the industry's commitment to uphold these standards, as well as the penalties that ensue for those who cross these boundaries. In conclusion, the path of journalism is paved with responsibility and respect towards every individual's story. Reporters must remember to conduct their tasks without losing sight of their empathy for the subjects they deal with. The ethical lapse of the sacked journalist serves as a call to all journalists. It stands as a stark reminder of the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, particularly in times of disaster when humanity should stand united. End Note: The unfortunate incident serves as a compelling lesson for all in the realm of journalism. Balance between the audacity of investigative journalism and sensitivity towards subjects, often victims, is quintessential. Journalism should always stand close to its moral compass, delivering the truth without compromising the dignity of its subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Passage: David Huxley is a mild-mannered paleontologist. For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zoo and, mistaking a dangerous leopard (also portrayed by Nissa) from a nearby circus for Baby, let it out of its cage. Question: Who does Susan fall in love with?","completion":"Susan falls in love with David."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Since the 1990s, Portugal's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports, private investment and the development of the high-tech sector.

But I can use this background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.

Options: a ) 60 km , b ) 87 km , c ) 33 km , d ) 67 km , e ) 20 km Student:","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance between A and B (let's call it D). We know the rowing speed in still water, the time taken to row from A to B and back, and the speed of the stream. We can use this information to find the distance. First, let's find the effective rowing speed downstream (with the stream) and upstream (against the stream). Downstream speed = rowing speed + stream speed = 9 kmph + 1 kmph = 10 kmph Upstream speed = rowing speed - stream speed = 9 kmph - 1 kmph = 8 kmph Let t1 be the time taken to row downstream (from A to B) and t2 be the time taken to row upstream (from B to A). We know that: t1 + t2 = 7.5 hours We can express time as the ratio of distance to speed: t1 = D / 10 (downstream) t2 = D / 8 (upstream) Now let's plug these expressions into the equation above: D / 10 + D / 8 = 7.5 To solve for D, first combine the terms on the left side: (8D + 10D) / 80 = 7.5 Now solve for D: 18D / 80 = 7.5 18D = 7.5 * 80 18D = 600 D = 600 / 18 D = 33.3333 Since this is a multiple-choice question, we can see that the closest option to our answer is 33 km.

For instructions on disconnecting the battery, see How to Disconnect a Car Battery. Be careful to remove all screws before trying to pry off the trim or you may break it. For some cars, you may need to remove several pieces of plastic trim, usually working from the bottom up. If you need to remove trim that includes any knobs or drawers, remove them before trying to pry off the trim. Use your hands or a pry tool to pry off each piece of trim. Pry tools are specifically for this purpose and will not damage the trim pieces. If you need to remove any components before being able to access the stereo, do so. Disconnect components that are wired to the car. Take a picture of how each is wired for later reference. Different cars may have varying elements securing the stereo in place. If the stereo is held in place by screws or nuts, loosen them with the appropriate tool (screwdriver or nutdriver, respectively). If the stereo isn't held in place by screws or nuts, you'll need to use a radio-removal key. This tool is commonly necessary in Ford vehicles. Radio-removal keys (sometimes also referred to as radio-removal tools) will typically either be in an elongated horseshoe shape or will have a circular shape at one end and a notched shaft at the other. They’re available at most auto-parts stores. Insert the keys into the two small slots in the face of the stereo. You will release a mechanism holding the stereo in place. Slide the radio-removal keys into each slot again until you feel the stereo loosen from in its housing. You should then be able to pull out the stereo relatively easily. You may want to use needle-nose pliers to grip the edge of the stereo and help you pull it out. Pull it gently, and if the stereo doesn't come out easily, double check that you haven't missed any components that may be holding it in place. This is an important step because the photo will serve as a reference later when you’re wiring in the new stereo. You’ll see a series of wires connected to the back of the stereo, and you’ll need to disconnect each of them. First unplug the antenna wire, which will typically be a thicker wire plugged in separately from the rest. Once it’s unplugged, you should be able to move the stereo around more freely. Next unplug the each of the wire harness connectors. There will typically be several of these and you can recognize them because a series of wires will feed into each one. The plastic piece into which the wires are fed should have either a tab or a button you can push, which will release the harness.

Other noteworthy tracks included \\"If Life Is Like A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft\\", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic \\"Sky Babies.\\" Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song.

Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger (in a move he later claimed to regret) fired guitarist CJ, and some of the album's tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. P.H.U.Q. was released in May 1995 and reached #6 in the British charts, making it the band's most successful album. Shortly after the album's release, Mark Keds of Senseless Things was drafted as second guitarist, but lasted just one recording session, in which he appeared on the B-sides for the single \\"Just in Lust\\". Within a few weeks Keds was sacked after disappearing to Japan for a farewell tour with his old band. The Wildhearts were again down to a three-piece (Ginger, McCormack, and Battersby) for a few months, and performed a few gigs in this incarnation. The band resolved to return to a two-guitar formation, and after requesting demos and holding auditions, hired the previously unknown Jef Streatfield. By late 1995 the band were finally fed up with their record label and set out to tour Japan and the UK, determined that they would split up unless East West would release them from their contract. The tours were a resounding success and eventually the band managed to escape their record contract.

The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter). The main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from \\"A clockwork orange\\") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. At least in my opinion. To wrap it up: shockingly brutal, revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. See \\"A clockwork orange\\" or \\"Le pianiste\\" instead. What is the sentiment of this review? OPT: a. negative. b. positive.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is a. negative. The reviewer expresses a strong dissatisfaction with the movie under discussion. Numerous phrases indicate the reviewer's negative attitude, such as \\"emotional rape on the viewer,\\" \\"pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed,\\" \\"main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent,\\" and the judgment \\"NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.\\" These would all suggest significant dislike and disappointment. The reviewer is critical of the film, both in its portrayal of its main character and the disturbing content, like the graphically depicted rape scene. They accused the director of using shock tactics, rather than meaningful storytelling or character development, to attract critical attention and provoke reactions. Moreover, they also wanted to see more nuanced commentary on the topics of violence, drug abuse, and juvenile delinquency instead of such pointedly graphic depictions. They further underpin their negative sentiment by recommending other movies like 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Le Pianiste,' which indicates their dissatisfaction with the film's potential wasted potential on essential artistic and societal issues. In conclusion, such intense criticism and displeasure clearly illustrate a negatively biased viewpoint and sentiment in the reviewer's perspective concerning the movie."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The original cost price of the car can be calculated by reversing the two percent changes. The friend sold the car for Rs. 54000, which represents a 20% gain. Therefore, 54000 represents 120% of the man's selling price. Divide 54000 by 1.2 to get the man's selling price, which is Rs. 45000. This represents 86% of the original cost price because the man made a 14% loss. Therefore, to find the original cost price, divide 45000 by 0.86 and the original cost price is Rs. 52325.58.

Article: Seven years of careful design and planning all came together on Monday, when James Cameron became the first human to make a solo trip to the deepest known point on earth - the Challenger Deep! More importantly though, he appeared safely seven hours later, completing with exciting-photos and videos from this dark mysterious world that has been visited by only two humans before! Seated inside a specially built 12-ton green submersible called the Deep Sea Challenger, the brilliant filmmaker caught every moment of his 2-hour-36-minute journey down to the bottom of the Mariana Trench on video -- given that it is 120 times larger than the Grand Canyon and a mile deeper than Mount Everest. Absolutely nothing! There were no large alien creatures or mysterious footprints -- just a flat desolate landscape, 50 times larger than the Grand Canyon. Mr. Cameron describes it as \\"devoid of sunlight, any heat, any warmth\\". The only things swimming around, were some tiny shrimp-like creatures no bigger than an inch. While the 57-year-old had expected to spend six hours at the bottom, he was forced to return in three hours, because the robotic arm that was supposed to help him collect samples went wrong and began leaking oil. He also lost some thrusters and a whole starboard side, causing the submersible to spin around in circles. However, these small setbacks did not make the whole trip any less exciting for Mr. Cameron. The director, who returned to the surface in a speedy seventy minutes, believes this is just one of many trips he and other adventurers will be taking. In fact, Sir Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, is currently in the midst of planning a similar trip to the Puerto Rico Trench that lies five miles below the surface of the water. Though Mr. Cameron's is promising to move his historic trip into an exciting 3-D National Geographic documentary, he is tight-lipped about how the experience will be used in his next movie! We cannot wait to see! Question: On the bottom of Challenger Deep, _ .

Context: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Why will stress be detrimental to a person?

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where does digestion begin and end?\\" is \\"Begins in esophagus and ends in small intestine\\"?","completion":"No, the statement is incorrect according to the information provided in the paragraph. Digestion actually begins in the mouth, not the esophagus, where food is mechanically broken down into smaller pieces by chewing and chemically broken down by enzymes present in saliva. The mouth is the initial part of the digestive system where the process of digestion starts; therefore, we say digestion begins in the mouth. Digestion does not end in the small intestine either. While it's true that most of the chemical digestion and nearly all the absorption of nutrients occur in the small intestine, the process doesn't end there. The remaining undigested food material goes into the large intestine or colon. Here the main role is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter, accept and store the remaining waste, and finally, excrete it through the rectum and anus, which is the end-point of the digestive system. So, the correct answer to the question \\"Where does digestion begin and end?\\" should be \\"Begins in the mouth and ends in the rectum/anus\\". The rectum and anus represent the final stages of digestion and elimination, thus marking the end of the digestive process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show.

Summarize the following: When water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind in your tank and it will increase your salinity. Use fresh distilled water that has been heated to the temperature of your aquarium to replace any lost water. Mark the tank at the top where the water level should be so you know how much water to add back in. Water needs to be changed and replaced every 2 weeks to remove filth and chemicals. Use a water siphon to remove 20% of the water from your tank and replace it with the same amount of heated saltwater. Alternatively, clean the tank weekly by removing 10% of the water once per week. When you’re mixing saltwater for a water change, make sure your solution has the same salinity as your tank. A stronger or weaker solution will raise or lower your tank’s salinity respectively. Mix and heat a saltwater solution 1 day before you perform a water change on your tank. Over time, salt deposits will form on the sides of your tank. The salt is removed from your water and will lower your salinity. Add a saltwater solution to your tank to raise the salinity back to the levels you need for your tank.","completion":"Water evaporation in an aquarium results in increased salinity levels due to the salt being left behind. To maintain a healthy environment for the aquatic life, it's essential to regularly monitor and adjust the salinity as needed. One way to do this is by using heated, distilled water that matches your aquarium's temperature to replace the evaporated water. Marking the desired water level on your tank can help ensure that you accurately replenish the water. In addition to replacing the evaporated water, it's crucial to change and replace a portion of the water in your tank to eliminate accumulated filth and chemicals. This process should be carried out every two weeks by using a water siphon to remove about 20% of the water, then adding an equal amount of heated saltwater. Alternatively, you can choose to perform weekly water changes by removing 10% of the water each time. When preparing the saltwater solution, it's important to match the salinity of your tank, as solutions with higher or lower salinity will affect the overall salinity levels in the tank. Preparing the saltwater mixture a day in advance of the water change allows for adequate mixing and heating, ensuring a stable environment for your aquatic life. Over time, it's normal for salt deposits to form on the sides of the tank. These deposits are a result of the salt being removed from the water, which leads to decreased salinity levels. To counteract this effect, a saltwater solution should be added to the tank to balance the salinity back to ideal levels for the aquatic residents. In summary, maintaining proper salinity levels in an aquarium is crucial for the health and well-being of its inhabitants. This can be achieved by regularly monitoring and adjusting the water content through the use of distilled water, frequent water changes, and carefully prepared saltwater solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group of larvae had fewer germline mutations? The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph and information, the group of larvae with fewer germline mutations would be Group D, as it did not display the various mutations that were found in Group L.

A. suffer pain B. talk to each other C. believe in god D. bank money E. wait in line The best answer is Answer:","completion":"A. suffer pain The best answer is A. suffer pain, as people generally try to avoid pain and suffering in their lives. Pain can be physical or emotional, and humans typically seek comfort and well-being in order to maintain a balanced life. A detailed explanation of each option is provided below: A. Suffer Pain: As mentioned above, people try to avoid pain because it causes discomfort and distress, which is not desirable. Pain can act as an alert sign that something is wrong in our body, or it can result from external injuries and stressors. In any case, it is a natural human instinct to avoid pain. B. Talk to each other: While some people may be introverted or shy and avoid social interactions, talking to each other is an essential part of human socialization and communication. In general, people do not actively try to avoid talking to one another. However, it might be context-dependent, as some might avoid confrontation or emotionally charged conversations. C. Believe in God: Belief in God or a higher power varies from person to person, and it is often influenced by cultural, religious, and personal factors. Some people firmly believe in God, while others do not. It is not accurate to say that people, in general, try to avoid believing in God, as it is an individual preference based on faith and personal experiences. D. Bank Money: People do not typically try to avoid banking money. On the contrary, most individuals rely on banks and other financial institutions to save, invest, and manage their money. The trust in these institutions allows people to feel safe and secure with their finances. However, some people might avoid banks due to mistrust, skepticism, or a lack of access to banking services. E. Wait in Line: Waiting in line is a common inconvenience that people generally dislike but cannot always avoid. In many situations, waiting in line is necessary for a variety of services or activities. While people may prefer not to wait in line, doing so is often unavoidable in day-to-day life. The increasing use of technology and online services, however, is minimizing the need for physical waiting in lines. In conclusion, out of the given options, A. suffer pain is the best answer to the question of what people try to avoid, as pain and suffering directly affect a person's physical and emotional well-being. The other options are context-dependent and vary from person to person, making them less universally applicable."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:North Ayrshire Council hopes the scheme will help youngsters who are entitled to free school meals during termtime. This is the first time a Scottish council has made a move of quite this nature and scale to help families on low incomes over the school holidays. Child poverty campaigners claim some parents struggle to feed their children properly when schools are shut. Across Scotland more than 250,000 children - including all children in P1-3 - are entitled to free school dinners. In many respects free meals are like a benefit to low income families - except they are not available for several weeks every year. North Ayrshire Council is opening 10 primary schools most days during the holidays for out of school activities. Children from 24 schools are eligible to attend. The scheme is open to all children - some parents may need childcare, other children may want to be with their friends and enjoy the holiday activities. But for parents of children entitled to free meals there is an important service - free meals in the holidays. Other children pay Â£2 for a meal. Council leader William Gibson hopes the scheme will be a real help to families on low incomes. It began two years ago but has been rolled out to primary schools across the area. About 1,200 meals are now being served every week to children - many of them for free. The council meets the cost itself. The vast bulk of Scottish councils have no similar schemes although East Renfrewshire has run \\"summer camps\\" which include free meals for eligible children at two of its schools for several years. Renfrewshire Council also has schemes to help children who get free meals over the holidays. Anti poverty campaigners say there is a real problem with \\"holiday hunger\\". The group Children in Scotland claims food banks and community projects are reporting increases in families seeking food for their children in non-term time. Children in Scotland Chief Executive Jackie Brock said: \\"Scotland has gone a long way to address hunger for young children during term-time, but we now need to focus on how we can support families during holidays when pressures are most intense. \\"Poorer families will find feeding their children, and finding childcare and holiday activities, very difficult and stressful. We must do more to support them. \\"Scotland has policies in place on food and wellbeing, as well as Curriculum for Excellence, that make us well-placed to make a change. \\"Alongside a coordinated and strategic response to poverty and hunger, we need to look to sustainably funded projects at a local authority or community level that can offer meals out with term-time.\\" Children in Scotland is currently developing a Families, Food, Futures programme across three council areas. It will target schools to offer a free and nutritious meal as part of a wider range of activities for children and their families. The programme will be based in schools with high deprivation levels but provision will be available to all in the school.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent . - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

Summarize: The Conservative peer, now chairman of the In Campaign, said the UK was \\"stronger in Europe\\" and to leave the EU would be a \\"leap into the unknown\\". It comes after a group of Conservative, Labour and UKIP MPs launched a campaign to take the UK out of the EU on Friday. David Cameron has promised a referendum on the issue by the end of 2017. The prime minister held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Chequers on Friday, in which he stressed he wanted to \\"secure reforms and then keep the United Kingdom in a reformed EU\\". A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron had noted the talks were \\"progressing well\\" but there was still \\"much to be worked through in order to find a solution\\". Lord Rose's appointment comes as a review of the \\"costs and benefits\\" of the UK's membership of the EU, to be conducted by the Treasury Select Committee, was announced. Stuart Rose and M&S: A 'beautiful friendship' The In Campaign - which officially launches its bid on Monday - said Lord Rose would take up the position with immediate effect. Lord Rose said leaving the EU \\"risked\\" Britain's prosperity. \\"The choice in the coming referendum is between remaining stronger, safer and better off inside Europe, or taking a leap into the unknown, risking our prosperity, threatening our safety, and diminishing our influence in the world,\\" he said. BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said the language used by Lord Rose was reminiscent of the successful Better Together campaign during last year's referendum on Scottish independence. The campaign could play on \\"the fear factor\\" of the UK leaving the EU, said our correspondent, adding: \\"He [Lord Rose] talks about a 'hard-headed practical decision', the UK being 'safer and stronger'. \\"But also he talks about 'a leap into the unknown', and I think that is something that is similar to the message that came from the 'No' campaign.\\" A guide to the EU referendum In or out? The arguments for and against What do big businesses say on the issue? EU referendum: What will happen when? What Britain wants from Europe Will Straw, executive director of the In Campaign, said Lord Rose brought \\"unparalleled experience of business and enterprise\\". \\"He knows the value that Britain's membership of the EU brings to businesses right across the UK, and what would be at risk if we left,\\" he said. Vote Leave, made up of Conservative, Labour and UKIP MPs and donors, launched its campaign on Friday. Supporters of the campaign, which says it wants to negotiate a new deal based on free trade and friendly co-operation, include Labour's Kate Hoey and UKIP's Douglas Carswell. It is competing with a rival group - the UKIP-backed Leave.EU - to be the official campaign to leave the EU. The Electoral Commission has yet to designate the official campaigns on either side of the EU debate. The chosen groups will benefit from increased spending limits of Â£7m during the campaign period, campaign broadcasts, and a free mailout to households. They all get access to public meeting rooms and to the electoral register, and are entitled to public grants of up to Â£600,000. The Electoral Commission has recommended voters in the election are asked whether the UK should \\"remain in\\" or \\"leave\\" the EU, rather than being asked to answer a \\"yes or no\\" question. The government has tabled an amendment to the bill. Summary:","completion":"A man named Lord Rose, who is the chairman of the In Campaign, said that the UK is stronger when it is a part of Europe and leaving would be a big, uncertain step.

Gases cause pressure beneath the earth. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. 3. The magma cools. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. 5. The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose more magma cools. How will this affect the system if less pressure is created? To evaluate this, let's consider the impact on each individual step. Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the earth. - The perturbation does not appear to have a direct effect on this step, as the hypothesis pertains to magma cooling and not the generation of gases that cause pressure. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. - If more magma cools, it might indirectly affect this step by altering the amount of molten magma available to be pushed to the surface. However, the hypothesis states that less pressure is created, which could result in less magma being pushed to the surface. Step 3: The magma cools. - The perturbation has a direct effect on this step, as it hypothesizes an increase in the rate of magma cooling. Step 4: With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. - The perturbation has a direct effect on this step, as it implies that less pressure will be created. If less pressure is created, it will take more time for the pressure to build up significantly. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode. - The perturbation has an indirect effect on this step. With more magma cooling and less pressure being created, the likelihood of a volcanic explosion might be reduced, as explosions typically occur when pressure builds up to a critical point. However, the extent of this effect depends on other factors such as the rate of gas generation and the specific geological conditions present. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation involving more magma cooling and less pressure created does have direct and indirect effects on the volcanic process. It primarily affects the magma cooling rate and time for pressure to build up significantly, which can in turn influence the likelihood of a volcanic explosion. However, the extent of these impacts would depend on various geological factors and the overall rate of changes in pressure and magma cooling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: During 1964, in the months following World War III, the conflict has devastated the Northern Hemisphere, polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout, killing all life there. Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south; the only areas still habitable are in the far reaches of the Southern Hemisphere. From Australia, survivors detect an incomprehensible Morse code signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The last American nuclear submarine, USS Sawfish, under Royal Australian Navy command, is ordered to sail north to the United States to attempt to make contact with the sender of the Morse signal. The submarine is commanded by Captain Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), who must leave his new friend, the alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). The Australian government arranges for its citizens to receive suicide pills or prepared injections so they may end things quickly before there is prolonged suffering from radiation sickness. An Australian naval officer, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and his wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster, have a baby daughter. Assigned to travel with the American sub for several weeks, Peter tries to explain to Mary how to euthanize their baby and then kill herself in case he is not yet home when the end comes; Mary reacts very emotionally at the prospect of killing her daughter and herself. One scientist's theory is that the radiation level near the Arctic Ocean could be lower than that found at the mid-Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. The theory is to be explored along with the submarine's main mission. After sailing to Point Barrow, Alaska, they determine that radiation levels are, on the contrary, intensifying.

Living Las Vegas: Sun Belt cities offer new take on race The Shops at Summerlin, left, under construction, and the Red Rock Casino, right, in Las Vegas, east of the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.Ethan Miller/Getty Images LAS VEGAS â Andrew Spivakâs academic research comes to life every time he drives by the school bus stop on Sunset Road and Durango Drive near his new home on the cityâs west side. âI have never lived some place that was so diverse,â said Spivak, a sociology professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. âProbably half the kids are black or Hispanic. Thatâs nothing that Iâd experienced, especially when I lived in New England and Oklahoma.â People of different races and ethnicities are more likely to live side by side in the fastest-growing parts of the Sun Belt âÂ areas that are constantly sprouting housing developments on desert or farm land without the pre-civil-rights legacy of segregation still ingrained in many older cities in the Northeast and Midwest. These new subdivisions and master-planned communities âÂ all built after the Fair Housing Act of 1968 âÂ have no history of racial separation. They didnât start out as white or black because no one lived there before. As a result, they offer a clean slate of opportunity to anyone who can afford to live where they want to live and a glimmer of a postracial society. Research, including Spivakâs, shows that among the largest metropolitan areas, Las Vegas and other booming areas, such as Riverside, Calif., and Phoenix, have the lowest levels of black segregation from other groups. Nationwide, residential segregation has consistently declined since 1980, and the 10 least segregated metro areas all grew faster than the national average of 11 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to Kelvin Pollard, a demographer at the Population Reference Bureau. By contrast, some of the most segregated (Detroit, New Orleans and Milwaukee) lost population. âThe ghettos of the Northeast and Midwest are not being reconstituted in the fast-growing areas of the South and West,â said demographer John Iceland, head of the sociology department at Penn State. The most striking reason for the lower rate of segregation is that most of these newer places have few remnants of a pre-civil-rights society and fewer established racial enclaves. When a suburb or neighborhood gets a reputation for not being welcoming to blacks or other minorities, the perception can linger for decades, and it has in many older cities. But not so in much of the Sun Belt. The rapid growth brought on by a constant influx of newcomers from all parts of the U.S. and the world has shattered the vestiges of racial separation so deeply rooted elsewhere.Â Younger migrants are less likely to harbor discriminatory attitudes and are more likely to be in mixed-race relationships. The most striking reason for the lower rate of segregation is that most of these newer places have few remnants of a pre-civil-rights society and fewer established racial enclaves. Cassandra Smith, an African-American agent with Realty One Group, estimates half her clients are black. But black or white, most of the newcomers who are house hunting care about the same things: safety, schools and services.Â âMost of them are educated and working,â she said. And because housing is cheaper here, they can afford to buy in more upscale subdivisions. Everyone sets their sights on Summerlin, an affluent sprawling master-planned development west of the city where a brand-new, four-bedroom, two-bath home can be had for less than 350,000 and where schools are top-notch. Homes are about half the price of a three-bedroom, 50-year-old, ranch-style home in middle-class areas of Los Angelesâ San Fernando Valley. If Summerlin is too expensive, they may settle north or south or just east, an area often referred to locally as Not Quite Summerlin. Thatâs where Derek Duncan, 37, lives âÂ on a cul-de-sac that presents the ultimate in diversity, with homes for less than 200,000. Duncan, who works in sales for lighting supplier DecoLights, is black and Italian. His wife is white. His stepson is a quarter Puerto Rican, and his half-brother is black. The neighbors? Two families are Hispanic, one is white, one is mixed-race Hawaiian, and one is Filipino. Occupations? A musician, a casino worker, a tow truck company operator, a retiree.Â âMy neighborhood is a complete mixed bag,â Duncan said. His memories of living in Boston as a kid are very different.Â âMy family was from a black area of Dorchester, and everyone was â¦ black or Jamaican,â he said. âJust down the street, across two major streets, you had one neighborhood that was primarily Hispanic and then one that was primarily white. My dad lived in South Boston, where it was primarily Irish. The school I went to was primarily black.â But Duncan is well aware of Las Vegasâ history of segregation. His mother, Katherine Duncan, founded the Westsideâs Ward 5 Chamber of Commerce.Â In the time of segregation, blacks were pushed to the west side of what is now I-15, a line they crossed only to go to work as maids and servers in the glitzy hotels and casinos on the Strip. The area was dubbed the Black Strip and eventually, just Westside. âEven that community is far more diverse than it used to be,â Smith said, driving past the boarded-up apartments that housed hotel workers. On West Bonanza Road, she points to the dilapidated remains of the Moulin Rouge, billed as the first interracial casino resort when it opened in 1955. (Boxer Joe Louis was the only black owner.) The resort mysteriously shut down after a few months. The casino was gutted by a fire, and the hotel is just a shell, but it remains Las Vegasâ best-known black symbol. Smith is a Las Vegas native; her parents moved from the Deep South, as many blacks did over the decades, to work in the flourishing hotels and casinos. Her mother was a hotel maid, and her father helped set up trade shows. They settled in North Las Vegas, not in Westside, Vegasâ only historic black area, where black churches are still clustered. There were riots there in 1992, after four white police officers were found not guilty of beating black motorist Rodney King in Los Angeles. The violence sparked millions of dollars in local and federal investment and efforts to improve relations with police. âThat community is still very much still there but with a lot of Latino families,â Smith said. The Moulin Rouge, the first racially integrated casino in Las Vegas, in 1956.7927/Gamma/Getty Images But thatâs not where the thousands of African-Americans who joined the hundreds of thousands who migrated to the Sun Belt live now. Some are teachers, business professionals, and many are younger. âLas Vegas is one of the most diverse areas of any part of the country that Iâve been in,â said Gene Collins, director of the local chapter of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization. âSegregation is not an issue here. If you can afford to live someplace, you can move in. As soon as the Fair Housing Act passed, blacks could live wherever they could afford to live and chose to live.â African-Americans are in smaller numbers in these Sun Belt boomtowns, which contributes to increased diversity and less clustering.Â âWe do see this correlation between the size of the black population and segregation,â Iceland said. âAt the same time, some of the Sun Belt cities that have lower and declining black segregation have growing black populations.â Blacks made up 10.5 percent of the 2 million people living in Las Vegasâ Clark County, compared with 12.6 percent nationally, according to the 2010 Census. But the countyâs African-American population jumped more than 50 percent since 2000, compared with a 12 percent increase nationwide. Even among metro areas with the nationâs largest black populations, black segregation is lower. Houston ranks 21stÂ and Atlanta 24th, according to research by John Logan, a segregation expert at Brown University. âThere are two Americas,â he said, âthe America where segregation stays high â¦ then thereâs the part of the country where African-Americans have not been as segregated, are present in much smaller numbers and have incorporated into neighborhoods. These are areas where things are really changing.â Iva Harris, 71, a retired high school counselor and sometime actress, and her husband, Ermon Harris, 72, a military retiree, moved after 30 years in Stockton, Calif., to a guarded gated community on the southwest side of the city. They bought a home with a casita, or guesthouse, for 400,000. At the peak of the housing boom, it was worth 1.2 million, but it has since tumbled to about half a million. âWe didnât know an awful lot about Las Vegas,â said Iva Harris, who also runs a cosmetics company. âI didnât know the makeup, but I knew I was going to a somewhat affluent neighborhood. I knew I was going to be a minority.âÂ That was 11 years ago. Now, a third of the 18 homes on her street are occupied by African-Americans. Thatâs not to say that racism and discrimination have vanished, said Collins, a Louisiana native who has been in Vegas 56 years. âIâve been a part of the changes as they occurred,â he said. âI chose to live in West Las Vegas to make sure the community is safe â¦ Itâs really not black anymore.â He and other community leaders raise questions of equity in police treatment of blacks and say there continues to be a lack of investment in whatâs left of the cityâs historic black area.Â âWeâre very represented in most neighborhoods if you can afford them,â said Katherine Duncan. âItâs based more on income than skin color, but most of the disparity is in other parameters â¦ the workforce, and blacks overly represented in the prison population.â Even Harris sometimes wonders why there are so many black families on her block and whether some agents intentionally steered black buyers to that corner of the upscale community. The Ward 5 Chamber of Commerce is organizing a weeklong event this month to remind residents of the role the Emancipation Proclamation played in helping Nevada become a state 150 years ago.Â âWhen I arrived in Las Vegas, I thought it was the best place in the world for African-Americans,â said DerekÂ Duncan, whose family moved here more than three decades ago. âThere were black headliners [at the casinos]. I never experienced any segregation. There were no mosquitoes. The weather was beautiful. And there were African-American businesses that were thriving. But, he added, no one âÂ regardless of skin color âÂ is immune from economic downturns. âBut now all that is gone, and it seems like while the city has become more and more integrated, the black community has lost its economic base,â he said. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text discusses how Sun Belt cities in the United States, such as Las Vegas, offer a new perspective on race and residential segregation. These newer cities and suburbs, which were developed after the Fair Housing Act of 1968, do not have a history of racial separation.

Research has shown that Las Vegas and other fast-growing areas like Riverside, California, and Phoenix, Arizona, have the lowest levels of black segregation from other groups among the largest metropolitan areas. The lack of pre-civil-rights history and established racial enclaves in these newer cities is the main reason for the lower rate of segregation.

Last month he rode on a balloon with his friend Keith. First they were at the ground-level. They called it camp A. Then they rose to the height of three miles. They called it camp B. Eventually, they reached six miles above ground. They called it camp C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Where the air would be denser, camp A or camp B? Hint: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. Answer:","completion":"The air would be denser at camp A, which is at ground-level. This is because air pressure and density decrease as altitude increases. As mentioned in the hint, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure at an altitude of about six miles. This significant decrease in pressure means that the air is less dense as you go higher. At camp A, the air is denser because it is at ground-level where the atmospheric pressure is higher. At camp B, the air is less dense because they rose to a height of three miles, which is higher than ground-level. The decrease in air pressure as they ascended resulted in a corresponding decrease in air density. Therefore, the denser air is found at camp A, when compared to camp B. This decrease in air density is also why passengers in commercial airplanes need pressurized cabins at high altitudes, as there is less oxygen available in each breath of air, making it harder to breathe and maintain comfort and survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then I noticed one on the wall, one on the noticeboard, and then one on my classroom door. In fact, they were stuck to nearly every available surface along the corridor. And they all had the same statement:\\"All I'm asking for is a little respect seeing I pay you PS9,000 a year.\\" I still don't know what led to this flyer campaign -- it is said that it's linked to a group of students who were not given extra assignment grade for their examination -- but I could not help but become annoyed at the impolite language. I started to think about the ways that my students act and speak, and the way I acted and spoke during my time at university. I will admit that I didn't do all of the readings, and yes, I may have missed a couple of lectures throughout the year, but I completed all assignments and followed the guidelines presented to me, without expecting my lecturers to chase after me. I wish I could say the same for my students. As I walked through the car park with a colleague at the end of the day, we discussed the unrest that the posters had caused:\\"If you ask me,\\"he said,\\"all universities are going to need a customer services department before long.\\"And there it was, plain and simple, the issue that I hadn't been able to explain: these young people weren't behaving like university students, they were behaving like customers. I recalled the student who told me he was disappointed with his low grade because he had\\"paid so much money\\". My colleague topped it: when one of his students was asked to leave a seminar for not completing the reading, he responded:\\"I pay you to teach me what's in the article, not the other way around.\\" Last week I sent out the first round of grades for a module and had 12 emails of complaint within an hour.

Philadelphiaâs musical roots Union Transfer, a new, bi-level space, is fast becoming one of the hottest venues for live music on the US east coast. While jazz has early roots in New Orleans and Motown Records started in Detroit, Pennsylvaniaâs largest city â more famously known as the birthplace of American independence â is home to a surprisingly eclectic mix of pioneering musical artists and new sounds. Philly Soul songwriters Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, jazz great John Coltrane, rock and soul sensation Patti Labelle, hip-hop pioneers The Roots, punk rocker Joan Jett, rapper Schoolly D, neo soul artist Jill Scott and consummate entertainer Will Smith (once half of the unforgettable pop rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince) are just a few of the artists who put Philadelphia on America’s musical map. Today, the city’s music scene continues to reflect its rich musical heritage. Established artists still call Philly home, while new venues and emerging local talent make the city a great stop for any music lover. So, get on board the love train (or, Amtrak) for a peek into the freedom loving, musical soul of Philadelphia. Start at World Cafe Live (WCL), a three million dollar space with two stages and incredible acoustics that marries the size, sophistication and cleanliness of an upscale theatre with a friendly, down-to-earth vibe. Founder Hal Real licensed the World Cafe name from radio station XPN in 2004, but besides sharing the same building, passion and “philosophy about the power of music”, World Cafe Live (the venue) and World Cafe (the radio show, syndicated by NPR ) operate independently of one another. WCL embraces local artists, many of whom built their followings at the venue’s Philly Rising open mic nights or Monday Jazz Jams. Philly singer/songwriter Lizanne Knott, who performs often and runs the city’s outpost of the New York Songwriters’ Circle at WCL, called the atmosphere “respectful and like family”. With 550 ticketed and 200 free shows a year, WCL hosts live music in just about every genre, including jazz, rock, folk and rap (Philly native Queena Marie stopped by in early January 2012). The cafe is also where artists often gain popularity before becoming global superstars -- Adele played four times before she got her big break and Corinne Bailey Rae was a chart-topping UK artist first introducing herself to US audiences when she played WCL in 2006. Not far from WCL is The Blockley Pourhouse, a two-and-a-half-year-old nightclub in a space that was once a 19th-century insane asylum. More recently, The Blockley was the home of The Chestnut Club, a popular venue in the 1980s and 90s for iconic acts such as The Ramones, Violent Femmes, Iggy Pop, De La Soul, Nirvana and the Dave Matthews Band. With a small stage, wide dance floor and well-stocked bar, the Blockley’s young, party atmosphere is perfect for a mix of alt rock, hip hop, electronic and rap shows, where local artists and regional/national acts play the 700-person, (primarily) standing-room-only space. Dr. Fameus (from local electronic jam band Disco Biscuit) and Inspectah Deck of Wu-Tang Clan played recently, while nostalgia is kept alive with monthly performances by Splinter’s Sunlight, Philly’s most popular Grateful Dead tribute band. Two musts for indie rock are Kung Fu Necktie and veteran Johnny Brenda’s, both located in Philly’s Fishtown area and among the best spots in the country for indie music according to QD Tran, an editor at The Deli, a national indie music scene website. Kung Fu Necktie opened its doors in 2008 (two of its owners are from Lit Lounge on New York City’s Lower East Side) and the weathered dive bar atmosphere is accented with kitschy, vintage items that could be from your eccentric aunt’s private art collection (if your eccentric aunt plays pinball). You will find mostly local indie rock and local DJs, plus the occasional record launch party. At Johnny Brenda’s, founded in 1967 by pro boxer Johnny Brenda and under new ownership since 2003, more established national indie rock bands like Tokyo Police Club, Dr Dog, Nada Surf and Fleet Foxes join the line up of local, emerging indie talent. The bi-level venue, which has an elevated stage, wraparound balcony and capacity for 250 people, draws a decidedly hipster crowd. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Write an article with the title: \\"'Mr. Robot' creator has a very 'Mr. Robot' response to Trump's presidency\\"","completion":"Title: 'Mr. Robot' Creator Has a Very 'Mr. Robot' Response to Trump's Presidency Introduction: Sam Esmail, the brilliant mind behind the critically acclaimed television series, \\"Mr. Robot,\\" which aired from 2015-2019, has cultivated a reputation for offering incisive and powerful social commentary on today's digital age. Addressing issues such as wealth inequality, corporate greed, and technology's role in modern society, \\"Mr. Robot\\" has been a force to be reckoned with. As expected, with a creative mind like Esmail's, there was no way he would stay silent on the subject of Donald Trump's four-year term as President of the United States. So, what did Esmail think of the 45th president, and how could the themes present in \\"Mr. Robot\\" shed light on his feelings towards Trump's presidency? Let's explore. Setting the Stage: For those unfamiliar with \\"Mr. Robot,\\" the show centers around Elliot Alderson, a cybersecurity engineer and a vigilante hacker played by Emmy winner, Rami Malek. The show's protagonist, Elliot, suffers from social anxiety disorder and clinical depression. In the series, he ultimately starts a cyber-revolution to expose and take down the corrupt leaders of the Earth's most powerful conglomerate, E Corp. The series was known for its critique of corporate power, as well as for its daring exploration of mental health, political conspiracy, and technology's impact on society. The show's complex themes and compelling narrative were set against a backdrop of a United States grappling with inequality, politics, and the growing presence of technology. Sam Esmail's Take on Trump's Presidency: To understand how Sam Esmail's response to Trump's presidency is undeniably linked to the themes explored in \\"Mr. Robot,\\" we need to look at the link between dissatisfied citizens like the show's protagonist and the voting population that helped usher in Trump's era. Operating in a landscape where technology was often used as a means of control, surveillance, and manipulation, \\"Mr. Robot\\" highlights how easily power can be acquired and abused, concerns that echo many of the criticisms of the Trump administration. The election of Donald Trump can, in part, be attributed to a frustrated and disillusioned segment of the American population seeking change. This frustration, which can also be seen in the motivations of Elliot and his revolutionaries, highlights how the sentiment of resistance against the establishment is prevalent even outside the realm of fiction. Esmail's response to Trump's presidency can be summarized as a call to action, rather than a resignation into apathy and despair. \\"Mr. Robot\\" demonstrates the impact and societal value of individual action, even when pitched against a seemingly insurmountable force, and encourages viewers to question existing power structures and corruption. Esmail's response to Trump's administration reflects these values, urging people not to succumb to cynicism but instead to hold their leaders accountable. Addressing the Larger Picture: Esmail's response to Trump's presidency highlights the importance of viewing current events in a broader social and cultural context. Just as \\"Mr. Robot\\" tackled issues surrounding technology's effect on our everyday lives and the influence of powerful corporations, the political implications of the Trump administration reflected similar concerns. It is therefore pertinent for people to examine the role that technology played in Trump's election and influence - from the Cambridge Analytica scandal to the many controversies surrounding social media's effect on the 2016 election. It is also essential to remember that the core themes of \\"Mr. Robot\\" - questioning authority, examining corporate influence on politics, and understanding the role technology plays in our lives - are more relevant than ever before. Conclusion: As it turns out, Esmail's response to Trump's presidency is entirely in line with the values and themes that \\"Mr. Robot\\" explores. By incorporating these themes into a groundbreaking television show, Esmail has given audiences the tools to question the status quo and recognize the need for change. It is this ethos that also sets the stage for a thought-provoking and highly relevant response to the political and social upheavals of the past several years. In a world that has become increasingly digitalized and interconnected, the lessons we can learn from \\"Mr. Robot\\" are more relevant than ever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The king of Wu was badly hurt and soon died. His son Fu Chai became the new king. Fu was very sad and angry and he decided to fight back for his father's death. He trained his army strictly until it was very strong. Three years later, he led his army against the State of Yue and caught its king Gou Jian, who was taken to the State of Wu. Gou Jian was put into a small black stone house which was full of terrible smell and was made to raise horses. Gou worked hard and tried to keep himself quiet, but he never forgot his pain. Many years later, he was set free. Gou secretly trained his army after he went back to his own state. In order to make himself strong-minded he slept on firewood and ate a gall bladder before having dinner and going to bed every night. After a few years, his country became strong once more. Then Gou took hold of a golden chance to fight against Wu and won the war in the end. If one voluntarily works very hard and voluntarily stands up to pains and difficulties in order to succeed, we might call him a\\"Gou Jian\\", and his story, a\\"Gou Jian's story\\".

Answer the following question: Information: - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Arkansas is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821.

The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves.

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - Oldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the latter half of the 20th Century, specifically from around the mid 1950s to the 1970s or 1980s. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.

A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a \\"meandering\\" course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a \\"snaking\\" pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

Choices: - america - western hemisphere - northern hemisphere - occident - north america is the world’s third-largest continent – 24 The rationale to choose \\"northern hemisphere\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"North America experiences winter at the beginning of the year because it is located in the Northern Hemisphere. The Earth's axial tilt causes the different seasons as it orbits around the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth tilts away from the Sun during winter, resulting in less direct sunlight and lower temperatures. The winter season generally runs from late December to late March, although the specific timing and intensity of winter weather can vary depending on the region. To recap, the rationale for choosing \\"Northern Hemisphere\\" as the answer for why North America has winter at the start of the year is because it accurately describes the location of the continent and its position relative to Earth's axis and orbit.

Please answer the following question: A Bite of China, made by CCTV's Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs. When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read more about what is presented in the documentary. Who are the creators? The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama's America was directed in large part by a conservative writer, it's not surprising that it's critical of President Obama from the beginning. Why is 2016: Obama's America mentioned in the article? A) Because the author dislikes Obama. B) Because it is a persuasive example. C) Because it is quite popular in China. D) Because it is directed by a writer.[:Z. xx. k.Com] Answer:","completion":"B) Because it is a persuasive example. This choice makes the most sense based upon the context provided. The article uses 2016: Obama's America as an example to illustrate the point that the creators or financial backers of a film can significantly influence its presentation. In this case, since the documentary was directed by a conservative writer, it's critical of President Obama from the outset. There is no information in the passage suggesting that the author dislikes Obama, the documentary is popular in China, or it is mentioned because it was directed by a writer. Therefore, it is a persuasive example in the context of the article, demonstrating the impact of the creators' or backers' biases on the documentary's narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was once distinctly unsettled by a utility man who called to read the gas meter. We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson.

As a professional dancer, Pasha Kovalev is used to pushing his body - and, apart from an occasional sniffle, it's served him well. 'I had a few colds, but nothing serious. I was always on the dancefloor, which kept me in good shape,' says the 33-year-old, who has appeared on Strictly Come Dancing since 2011, partnering celebrities such as singer Kimberley Walsh and, in the new series, Countdown's Rachel Riley. But it was this hard-working lifestyle, he believes, which led to a bout of illness so severe it could have cost him his life. In step: Strictly Come Dancing partners Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev. In 2006, Pasha was living in New York, where he came down with a sore throat - accompanied by fever, heavy limbs, trouble swallowing and extreme fatigue. 'I assumed it was just a common cold,' says Pasha, who is from Russia. But over the course of six days he became so ill his friend called an ambulance. After a battery of tests, he was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome. A complication of tonsillitis, it causes inflammation in the head or neck. The condition causes the bacteria infecting the throat to get into the jugular vein -– the main vein that runs through the neck and connects the head to the heart. This leads to the lining of the vessel becoming inflamed, disrupting the flow of blood and triggering the formation of a blood clot, which is infected with the bacteria. After a scan found Pasha had a blood clot, doctors told him there was a danger of it spreading into his brain, where it could result in a stroke. He was given antibiotics and blood-thinners to try to prevent it from getting bigger so his body could break it down. Another potential risk is of bacteria escaping into the bloodstream within broken pieces of clot or independently. This could lead to life-threatening blood poisoning, or septicaemia. Hooked up to drips and unable to eat solid food, Pasha lost 20lb in less than a fortnight and felt weak, but he stayed positive. 'I am quite chilled out and my attitude was: “If the blood clot moves, it moves, but for now I am still here.” ' Deceptive: Pasha thought he had a minor cold, but after a slew of tests he was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome, a complication of tonsillitis. Thankfully, Pasha's clot did dissolve and he was discharged from hospital within three weeks - but he was left with a weakened immune system for months. Though Lemierre's is rare, complications stemming from throat infections are not uncommon. 'Sore throats are more common than any other type of infection,' says Andrew McCombe, ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant and spokesman for ENT UK. 'Though the majority will be nothing to worry about, if it gets nasty, bacteria can get into the bloodstream, make you very sick and interfere with the function of organs. In exceptional circumstances, they can cause septicaemia, which can lead to death.' The three main structures of the throat that can feel sore are the larynx (voice box), pharynx (the throat) and tonsils. Inflammation of these areas are known as laryngitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis. The latter is the most common, with most children experiencing it at least once. Experts are warning that tonsillitis is on the rise, and this is causing an increase in a condition called quinsy. This is a complication of tonsillitis, and causes pus to develop between the tonsils and the back of the throat. 'Quinsy is common,' says Mr McCombe. 'We see two or three cases a week where I work, and there are 6,000 admissions for quinsy across the country every year. We're seeing more as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies.' As well as a painful abscess (up to the size of a walnut) and sore throat, patients with quinsy may have trouble swallowing, which can lead to drooling, bad breath and an earache. If the infection gets into the bloodstream, it could lead to rigors (shivering), though doctors are unsure why, says ENT surgeon George Murty, of University Hospitals Leicester. 'Cases have increased two to three times in the past few years compared to previously,' says Mr Murty. 'It's not just more common, it is also more severe. 'I see more complications, such as the pus spreading. If it gets to the spinal cord, it could potentially cause paralysis. 'In the past year I've seen three major complications of quinsy. When I started 25 years ago, you'd see it once every couple of years.' He puts the increase down to GPs prescribing fewer antibiotics for sore throats - due to concerns over antibiotic resistance - as well as fewer children having their tonsils removed. 'The Government is keen to reduce the costs of surgery. Previously, the decision on whether you'd benefit from a tonsillectomy was made by the GP,' says Mr Murty. 'Quinsy is common. We see two or three cases a week where I work, and there are 6,000. admissions for quinsy across the country every year. We're seeing more. as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies.' 'Now it's increasingly more difficult for GPs to refer patients for tonsillectomies. You need to have many more episodes of tonsillitis - usually seven a year - before you have the operation.' But quinsy isn't the only complication of a sore throat. A quarter of children with throat infections will have a middle ear infection, or glue ear, where the fluid between the inner ear and eardrum becomes infected by bacteria. 'The bacteria can spread up the eustacian tube, which connects the back of the throat to the ear,' says Mr Murty. 'It can also happen when the tonsils and andenoids - lumps of tissue above the tonsils - swell up, blocking off this tube and meaning you can't ventilate it properly. This can lead to hearing loss. Fortunately, it's reversible.' Another potentially serious, but thankfully rare, complication arising from a throat infection is scarlet fever - characterised by a distinctive pinkish rash - and rheumatic fever, which leads to joint pain and swelling, and inflammation of the heart. These conditions develop in response to so-called 'strep throat' - a throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria. Throat infections can also result in glomerulonephritis - an inflammation of the kidneys that can ultimately lead to renal failure. It can be caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue as a consequence of the infection. And research has even pointed to a link between throat infections caused by the streptococcal bacteria and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), characterised by anxious thoughts and repetitive behaviours such as handwashing. Pushy: Pasha, pictured with Kimberley Walsh, says 'Now if I push myself, I make sure I have time to recuperate' A 2009 study from Columbia University concluded some cases of OCD could be caused by the body's attempt to attack the bacteria. One theory is that antibodies made by the body to attack the bacteria react with parts of the brain. However, many experts are unconvinced of the link. Despite the potential complications of a sore throat, Mr McCombe stresses most are minor and unlikely to lead to a serious problem. 'If it's an isolated sore throat, I wouldn't be too stressed,' he says. 'But if you also have joint pain, which could indicate bacteria spreading into the bloodstream, muscle ache, a temperature, headache and you feel really rotten, give it up to 48 hours and do the sensible things, such as taking on fluids, painkillers and anti-inflammatories. 'But if you feel worse after 48 hours, consider seeing your GP.' After Pasha recovered from Lemierre's, he decided to stop putting himself through gruelling dance competitions and concentrate on performing in shows. This led him into the world of TV via the U.S. version of So You Think You Can Dance, where the Strictly producers spotted him. 'For most of us, if everything is going well, you take things for granted - and that includes your health,' says Pasha. 'Now if I push myself, I make sure I have time to recuperate. Strictly can be intense, so I go on holiday as soon as it's over.' Pasha: The Autobiography Of TV's Hottest Dance Star by Pasha Kovalev (John Blake, £14.99).

He was living in New York in 2006 when he developed a sore throat, fever, and extreme fatigue. His diagnosis came after a friend called an ambulance as his health continued to decline. With Lemierre's syndrome, the bacteria from the throat spreads into the jugular vein, disrupting blood flow and leading to a blood clot. In Pasha's case, the blood clot had the potential to spread to his brain, causing a possible stroke. He was treated with antibiotics and blood thinners and took almost a month to recover, losing a notable amount of weight during the process. Inflammations in the throat can originate from the larynx, pharynx or tonsils, referred to as laryngitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis respectively. Tonsillitis is said to be on the rise, leading to a condition called quinsy. Quinsy is a complication from tonsillitis that causes pus to develop between the tonsils and the back of the throat. One reason for the increased incidence of quinsy is a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies. Sore throats may also lead to other complications like middle ear infection or glue ear in children, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, and possibly even obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to a link between streptococcal bacteria and OCD. After his recovery, Kovalev decided to focus on performing in shows instead of participating in grueling dance competitions.

Article: A device that stops drivers from falling asleep at the wheel is about to undergo testing at Department of Transport laboratories and could go on sale within 12 months. The system, called Driver Alert, aims to reduce deadly road accidents by 20% - 40% that are caused by tiredness. Airline pilots can also use it to reduce the 30% of all pilot-error accidents that are related to fatigue. Driver Alert is based on a computerized wristband. The device, worn by drivers or pilots, gives out a sound about every four minutes during a car journey. After each sound the driver must respond by squeezing the steering wheel. A sensor in the wristband detects this pressing action and measures the time between the sound the driver's response. Tiredness is directly related to a driver's response time. Usually, a watchful driver would take about 400 milliseconds to respond, but once that falls to more than 500 milliseconds, it suggests that the driver is getting sleepy. In such cases the device gives out more regular and louder sounds, showing that the driver should open a window or stop for a rest. If the driver's response continues to slow down, the sounds become more frequent until a nonstop alarm warns that the driver must stop as soon as possible. The device has been delivered to the department's laboratories for testing. If these tests, scheduled for six months' time, are successful, the makers will bring the product to market within about a year. Question: How should a driver respond to the sounds from Driver Alert?

Neither Northern Ireland nor Wales had ever qualified for the European Championship before this year's edition, the first to feature 24 teams, while it is the first time the Republic have made the knockout stages of a Euros. The last time the Republic of Ireland played France was in 2009, when Thierry Henry handled the ball in the build-up to the deciding goal in a World Cup qualification play-off. With a population of just 330,000, England's opponents Iceland are the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament.

Write a text based on \\"difrancesco quits nj governor race\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Difrancesco Exits New Jersey Governor Race In a surprising turn of events, Difrancesco has officially announced his withdrawal from the New Jersey Governor race. The news has shaken the political landscape of the state and prompted speculations about the reasons behind his decision. Difrancesco, a prominent figure in New Jersey politics, initially entered the race with high hopes of securing the governorship. However, recent polls have shown a decline in his popularity among voters, leading to a dip in campaign morale. There are a few potential reasons behind Difrancesco's decision to withdraw from the race. Firstly, it is possible that the decrease in voter support led him to believe that his chances of winning were slim. As a result, rather than continue to invest time, money, and resources into a campaign that seemed increasingly unlikely to succeed, Difrancesco may have decided to take a step back. Secondly, there could be undisclosed personal reasons for his decision to quit. Running a political campaign is both time-consuming and demanding, with candidates required to juggle numerous commitments, priorities, and responsibilities. If Difrancesco found himself unable to effectively manage these challenges, his withdrawal from the race might have been the responsible choice. Lastly, it is possible that forthcoming political developments influenced his choice. Aligning oneself with particular policies, parties, or politicians can have a significant impact on a candidate's odds of success. If Difrancesco saw a more promising opportunity elsewhere, or if he found that his political beliefs no longer aligned with his path to the governorship, he may have opted to change course. Regardless of the reasons behind Difrancesco's withdrawal from the New Jersey Governor race, his decision marks a significant shift in the contest. It remains to be seen how this new development will reshape the electoral map and influence voters' choices. With Difrancesco out of the race, other candidates must now reevaluate their strategies and seize the opportunity to capture undecided voters. In conclusion, while the exact reasons behind Difrancesco's decision to quit remain uncertain, his departure undoubtedly has a substantial impact on the political landscape of New Jersey. As the race for governor continues, all eyes will be on the remaining candidates and how they adapt to this unexpected development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The tweet starts with a strong positive sentiment, expressed by \\"i lovee\\" followed by mentions of two users, \\"@winlovelyy\\" and \\"@meganlovelyy\\". This indicates that the person tweeting admires or shares a close bond with these two users. The use of the word \\"lovee\\" with an extra 'e' may be to emphasize their affection towards the mentioned users. Following this, the tweet mentions \\"So im wide awakee\\", which may imply a neutral tone or perhaps a slightly positive sentiment since the person is open to engaging in conversation, as they are awake. The addition of extra 'e' in \\"awakee\\" can be attributed to the informal and casual nature of the tweet. Lastly, the tweet concludes with \\"TEXTME??\\" which suggests that the person is inviting their followers or the mentioned users to communicate with them via text messages. The use of double question marks can imply a sense of urgency or eagerness to receive text messages. It can be seen as a mildly positive sentiment, as the person is actively seeking interaction with others. Combining all the portions of the tweet, the overall sentiment can be interpreted as positive.

Movie title: Scream 2 Movie plot: While attending a preview of the film Stab, a film within a film based on the Woodsboro murders depicted in the first film, two Ohio Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens are murdered by Ghostface. Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims.

Q:Process: - Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated - The result is that crude oil forms. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more energy from breaking happens, how will it affect less layers of sediment form above the matter. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed involves a scenario where more energy from the breaking process potentially leads to fewer layers of sediment forming above the decomposing organic matter. To understand the effect of this perturbation on the process of crude oil formation, we need to examine the stages of this process in more detail and discuss how the breaking process is related to it. The crude oil formation process essentially occurs through the following stages: 1. Accumulation of organic matter: Dead plants and organisms decompose and settle at the bottom of the ocean, forming layers of organic materials that accumulate over time. 2. Sedimentation: These layers of organic materials are covered by sediments, such as fine particles of sand, silt, and clay, which gradually accumulate on the ocean floor. Continuous deposition of sediments causes an increase in pressure and temperature within the buried organic matter. 3. Diagenesis: Under increasing temperature and pressure, the organic matter undergoes diagenesis, where it converts into kerogen, a waxy, insoluble organic substance that serves as a precursor to crude oil and natural gas. 4. Catagenesis: As pressure and temperature continue to rise due to deeper burial, kerogen undergoes catagenesis, which is a thermal decomposition process. During this stage, kerogen converts into hydrocarbons, including crude oil and natural gas. 5. Migration and accumulation: The generated hydrocarbons migrate through porous rocks and accumulate in reservoir rocks, such as sandstone or limestone, where they are trapped beneath impermeable layers called cap rocks. Now, let's examine the perturbation hypothesis. You suggest that more energy from the breaking process might lead to fewer layers of sediment forming above the decomposing organic matter. The breaking process could involve physical forces that influence the transportation and deposition of sediments in the ocean, such as waves, currents, and tides. More energy from the breaking process could potentially cause: 1. Redistribution of sediment: More energy from the breaking process might lead to stronger water movements, which could disperse sediments more widely or redistribute them within the water column. This could potentially lead to thinner layers of sediment forming above the organic matter, reducing the overall pressure and temperature experienced by the organic material. 2. Erosion: The higher energy in the breaking process could also cause increased erosion of the seafloor, preventing the consistent deposition of sediment layers and potentially even removing sediment from existing layers. If either of these possibilities occurs, the direct effect on the crude oil formation process would be a reduction in the pressure and temperature experienced by the organic matter. This could result in slower transformations of organic matter into kerogen and hydrocarbons, as both diagenesis and catagenesis are dependent on temperature and pressure. Less pressure due to fewer sediment layers might also hinder the migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons into reservoir rocks, reducing the chances of forming significant oil deposits. In essence, the perturbation hypothesis you've posited could indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of crude oil formation. A higher amount of energy in the breaking process could lead to fewer layers of sediment forming above organic matter, thereby slowing down or even hindering the transformation of organic matter into kerogen and ultimately crude oil, and potentially impacting the migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons in reservoir rocks. While the precise effects of this perturbation would depend on various factors, including the scale of the energy increase and geological conditions in specific locations, it's clear that the proposed perturbation could significantly alter the process of crude oil formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A wounded person is walked in on a wheelbarrow as Las Vegas police respond during an active shooter situation on the Las Vegas Stirp in Las Vegas Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. Multiple victims were being transported... (Associated Press) LAS VEGAS (AP) — A gunman on the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas Strip casino opened fire on an outdoor music festival, killing at least 20 people — including two off-duty police officers — and wounding more than 100, officials said early Monday. Country music star Jason Aldean was performing on stage when the shots began ringing out Sunday night at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Officers confronted the suspect on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino across the street from the concert and he was killed, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. Authorities did not release the suspect's name but said he is a local resident. Concert-goers reported hearing what they described as automatic gun fire during the shooting. Lombardo said they believe this was a \\"lone wolf\\" attack but said they were looking for a roommate of the dead suspect as a person of interest. The two slain off-duty officers were attending the concert, Lombardo said. Another off-duty officer was in critical condition and another was wounded, Lombardo said. Several officers from California were attending the music festival. A Bakersfield Police officer was shot and taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Hours after the shooting, Aldean posted on Instagram that he and his crew were safe and said the shooting was \\"beyond horrific.\\" Kodiak Yazzie, 36, said he and his girlfriend were watching Aldean's performance when he heard what sounded like fireworks. The music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage. Thousands fled as bursts of gunfire could be heard for more than five minutes, Yazzie said. Jose Baggett, 31, a Las Vegas resident, said he and a friend were in the lobby of the Luxor hotel-casino — directly north of the festival — when people began running. He said people were crying and as he and his friend walked away, they encountered police checkpoints where officers were carrying shotguns and assault rifles. \\"There were armored personnel vehicles, SWAT vehicles, ambulances, and at least a half-mile of police cars,\\" Baggett said. Witnesses said they saw multiple victims and dozens of ambulances near the concert venue. Some attendees later huddled in the basement of the nearby Tropicana hotel-casino. Officers carrying assault rifles ran into the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. Authorities shut down part of the Las Vegas Strip and Interstate 15. Flights were temporarily halted at McCarran International Airport because of the shooting, the airport said on its verified Twitter account. ___ An earlier version of this report had an incorrect spelling for the name of witness Kodiak Yazzie. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A lone gunman unleashed a rapid-fire barrage of bullets from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel late Sunday, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500 others attending a country music festival below, officials said.

President Donald Trump, who will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, called the shooting \\"an act of pure evil.\\" Police responded to reports of the shooting just after 10 p.m. (1 a.m. ET). Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Monday that authorities believe Paddock killed himself before police entered his room. Officials had said earlier that police fatally shot Paddock. Authorities were digging into Paddock's history. Other than a citation he received several years ago that was \\"handled as a normal practice\\" by the courts, he had no criminal background, Lombardo said.

Hotel employees had been in his room before the shooting and didn't notice anything unusual, according to Lombardo. Two broken windows could be seen from the 32nd floor of the hotel, curtains billowing out. Law enforcement officials said Paddock had connecting rooms or a suite and ran between the windows, firing out of both, either to get a different vantage point or to avoid return fire. They believe he smashed the windows with a something like a hammer before he started firing. The shooting started while performer Jason Aldean was onstage. Witnesses described a chaotic scene of back-to-back bullets raining down from above, lasting for up to 10 minutes. Fellow performer Jake Owen said he was standing about 50 feet from Aldean when the shots started. \\"It got faster and faster, almost like it was an automatic rifle,\\" Owen said. \\"At that point, everyone on stage started running everywhere.\\" Owen dashed by victims covered in blood and eventually found shelter in his bus. The gunfire still hadn't stopped by the time he got there, he said. \\"It wasn't something that was quick. It was chaos for a pure seven to 10 minutes,\\" he said.

Our goal is to find the value of \\"a.\\" 1. We have an equation: 93 = -293*a + 587 + 385 2. First, let's add the numbers on the right side of the equation: Right side = -293*a + 587 + 385 Right side = -293*a + 972 (since 587 + 385 = 972) 3. Now our equation looks like this: 93 = -293*a + 972 4. Next, we have to get \\"a\\" by itself. So, let's subtract 972 from both sides of the equation: Left side - 972 = 93 - 972 -879 = -293*a (since 93 - 972 = -879) 5. Finally, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by -293 to find the value of \\"a\\": -879 / -293 = -293*a / -293 3 = a (since -879 ÷ -293 = 3) So, the value of \\"a\\" is 3."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

Reasoning for choosing story 2: Option 1 mentions that the suitcase is flimsier, which would not be a reasonable choice to pack belongings, as it may result in damage or loss of items. In contrast, option 2 states that the box is flimsier, implying that the suitcase is more secure and sturdy. This option makes more sense as a practical choice to pack belongings. Continuing the story (Story 2): He packed his belongings in a suitcase instead of a box because the box was flimsier. The fragile items meant so much to him – photo frames, souvenirs he collected from his travels, and his grandmother's antique vase. He had heard one too many horror stories of valuable objects being ruined due to flimsy packaging during moves. This time, he wanted to make sure that everything would arrive at his new home safe and sound. The suitcase, once a reliable companion on countless trips, now served a new purpose. Its sturdy structure and secure clasps provided the perfect storage option for his precious belongings. He carefully wrapped each item in bubble wrap and soft cloth before arranging them snugly within the suitcase. The satisfaction he felt each time he heard the soft click of the suitcase shutting was proof that he had made the right decision.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Clark Griswold can forget about driving all the way to Walley World. If \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\" had been shot today, he just couldn't have taken the time off work. That's according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that Americans are taking fewer, shorter vacations. Workers pay a career penalty for vacation Nine million Americans took a week off in July 1976, the peak month each year for summer travel. Yet in July 2014, just seven million did. Keeping in mind that 60 million more Americans have jobs today than in 1976, that adds up to a huge decline in the share of workers taking vacations. Some rough calculations show, in fact, that about 80 percent of workers once took an annual weeklong vacation — and now, just 56 percent do. It's not as if Americans are cutting back on an excessive vacation habit, either. The United States is the only developed economy that doesn't guarantee its workers a paid vacation. Most of its peer nations promise about 20 days off a year, according to a report by Rebecca Ray, Milla Sanes, and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. About a quarter of the American workforce doesn't get paid vacation, according to data they cite from the National Compensation Survey. The no-vacationers usually work part-time or for small employers in low-wage jobs. The average American gets 14 days off from work, according to an annual survey by the travel company Expedia, but actually uses only 10 of those days each year. It's an open question why Americans don't use it all. They say their bosses are supportive and that scheduling got in the way. Others say they're are just stockpiling it for some future trip —but wouldn't someone, then, eventually take that trip? One possibility is that vacation suffers from a \\"Prisoner's Dilemma.\\" It's dangerous to be \\"that guy\\" who uses all the time off they get when everyone else is on the job, so workers limit their vacations. On balance, The Wall Street Journal says, the evidence does support that theory. Workers pay a career penalty for vacation. If Americans could establish a pro-vacation norm, those pressures would lessen. That seems to be happening in some workplaces, where bosses require workers to use their time off. That might be, for the most part, just a management fad. Yet it is surprisingly normal in one industry: finance. That's not out of kindness, however. Regulators have long recommended banks require vacations as a way of making it harder to conceal embezzlement. It's not clear what's driving the trend towards fewer, shorter vacations. Tourism tends to be very cyclical, but the decline of the great American vacation seems to have been a gradual affair. There aren't any shortage of possible explanations: lessened job security, stagnant median incomes, rising part-time employment, and an increasing share of households with more than one member employed could all be parts of the story. There's no obvious sign that any of this has hurt the travel industry, though. Hotel occupancy is back to pre-recession highs, and employment in the leisure and hospitality industry has been one of the bright spots of the recovery. It seems like they're carrying on, Griswolds or not. * Here's how the math works. The Current Population Survey surveys workers once a month about a specific \\"reference week.\\" If an employed person says they were absent that week — that is, they worked zero hours — and the reason why is \\"vacation,\\" they're counted here. There's no reason to think that workers are more likely to take off during the survey's reference week than any other, so we can divide the number of vacation absences by the number of workers, and raise that to the fourth power to get the percentage of workers who took a weeklong vacation in one month. Now we multiply the percentage of Americans who didn't across the last twelve months, since vacation is (obviously) seasonal. That gives you the share who haven't taken a vacation in the last year. The calculations assume that nobody takes more than one weeklong vacation each year. ||||| My wife and I returned Friday from two weeks of vacation in China, hanging out with one of our sons (posted there with the Peace Corps) and his girlfriend. We were mostly unplugged, wandered miles every day, traipsed the Great Wall and watched pandas, among other exotic (to us) exploits. And that’s what vacations are for – time away from the desk to, as an old friend once described it, get a chance to rub our fur in a different direction for a while. Who knew we were so rare? The folks at Vox report, based on recent federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data, that fewer Americans are taking weeklong vacations than in previous decades, for a range of reasons including fear of career repercussions to jobs that don’t offer accrued vacation days. According to Vox: “Nine million Americans took a week off in July 1976, the peak month each year for summer travel. Yet in July 2014, just seven million did. Keeping in mind that 60 million more Americans have jobs today than in 1976, that adds up to a huge decline in the share of workers taking vacations. “Some rough calculations show, in fact, that about 80 percent of workers once took an annual weeklong vacation — and now, just 56 percent do.” American workers receive an average of 14 vacation days a year, according to annual studies by Expedia. The average for the industrialized world is 20 days, led by generous time-off policies in many European countries. Yet Americans last year only used, on average, 10 of their 14 vacation. Many opted to leave the days in the bank, planning to use them later on, or hoping to cash them in at retirement. That's what vacations are for - time away from the desk to, as an old friend once described it, get a chance to rub our fur in a different direction for a while. But others cite difficulty in scheduling the time away (conflicts with fellow workers’ time off and synchronizing vacation time with working family members), lack of money to pay for trips, and job insecurity. When it comes time for layoffs, you don’t want to be the person deemed most expendable. Glassdoor conducted its own survey and found some different results: It says Americans took only about half of their allotted vacation time, though the reasons were similar to Expedia’s findings. When we’re on vacation, most of us still stay connected to work through email or other methods (guilty of that myself). Glassdoor found that those who reported working while on vacation cited the sense that no one could do their work while they were away (33%) and fear of falling behind (28%), among other reasons – including fear of getting fired. And that’s not healthy. When we work all the time and skip vacations, we often become burned out, resulting in reduced productivity and increased stress that can affect our physical health and personal relationships. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go check the office vacation calendar for next year. It’s never too early to plan.

But Chinese people appear to be even less willing to take time off. China — which is hosting the World Leisure Games in Qingdao this weekend — has a work culture even less vacation-friendly than the U.S. Over 72% of Chinese workers have not taken a paid vacation in the last three years, according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency, cited by the New York Times. Less than 14% of Chinese workers took a paid vacation in the last three years. Workers in China who have been employed continuously for one year are entitled to paid annual leave, according to the China Law Blog. The situation is better — if far from ideal — in the U.S. Employees only use 51% of their eligible paid vacation time and paid time off, according to another recent survey of 2,300 workers who receive paid vacation. The survey was carried out by research firm Harris Interactive for the careers website Glassdoor. What’s more, 61% of Americans work while they’re on vacation, despite complaints from family members; one-in-four report being contacted by a colleague about a work-related matter while taking time off, while one-in-five have been contacted by their boss. Workers appear to be getting more skittish when it comes to asking for time off. And employers too are clamping down: Summer Fridays are dead in the water, according to a 2015 survey of 15,723 Americans surveyed by Google Consumer Surveys in May 2015 for vacation site Priceline.com. Some 40% of Americans will leave vacation time on the table, a third study found, citing a post-recession “work martyr complex” among worker who feel tied to their desk. The study by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications and the U.S. Travel Association — which obviously has a vested interest in workers using up all their paid vacation time — found that one-third of the 1,000-plus respondents say they cannot afford to take their time, 40% fear returning to a mountain of work and 35% believe no one else can do their work. Also see: The Moneyologist: How many people should go on vacation together? This complex is reinforced by company culture and lack of encouragement from management to take time off, the GfK survey found. Even though senior business leaders overwhelmingly recognize the importance of using time off, two-thirds of American employees said their company says nothing about the need to take vacation days or discourages using them. In fact, one-third of senior business leaders state they never or rarely talk with employees about the benefits of taking time off. Most American workers receive around 10 paid work days a year and six federal holidays, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonprofit left-of-center think tank in Washington, D.C. So based on Bureau of Labor Statistics’ current average weekly earnings, they’re leaving more than 1,300 on the table by only taking half their paid time off. This amounts to more than 52 billion, according to economic researcher Oxford Economics, “All Work, No Pay: The Impact of Forfeited Time Off” — commissioned by the U.S. Travel Association and sponsored by American Express. Workers in the European Union are legally guaranteed at least 20 paid vacation days a year — and 25 or even 30 days a year in some European countries. Chinese workers who have been employed between one and 10 years are entitled to five days, and entitled to two weeks between 10 and 20 years’ service, the China Law Blog notes. People not used to taking time off may not understand that paid vacation is actually built into their compensation package. Under the The Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. is also one of the few developed countries that does not require employers to provide paid time off (see chart, below). Still, 91% of full-time U.S. workers receive paid vacation, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, but only 49% of low-wage workers — those in the bottom fourth of earners — get paid vacation. Why don’t they take what’s due? “Fear,” says Scott Dobroski, career trends analyst at Glassdoor. “That’s the underscoring theme.” Some 28% of workers told Glassdoor they fear getting behind while they’re sitting on a beach, another 17% actually say they fear losing their job, 19% don’t take all of their days in the hopes that it will give them an edge for a promotion, while 13% are competitive and wanting to outperform colleagues. As workers shoulder a heavier workload post-recession, he says others are afraid of not meeting goals. And that fear may not be misplaced, experts say. Citing cultural differences between Americans and Europeans is a “significant misreading” of the issue, says John Schmitt, senior economist at CEPR. “I don’t think that Americans love their families less than German or French workers who take all their vacation time,” he says. “Americans have less job security than European workers. That’s why they eat lunch at their desk and work late. And if you’re on vacation you are likely to miss important meetings.” Most U.S. companies have an “employment-at-will” doctrine, meaning they can be fired for any reason or no reason at all, unless they have a written contract, they’re in a labor union that has other rules relating to conditions of employment or they’re fired because of some kind of discrimination. “We have almost no job security in the U.S., no legal requirement for severance pay and, with very few exceptions, can be laid off without notice,” Schmitt says. (Of course, most employees can also leave without notice, although two weeks’ notice is standard when resigning.) “The inability to disconnect has led to a blurring of personal versus work life,” says Piera Palazzolo, senior vice president for marketing at Dale Carnegie Training. Since people take their work with them wherever they go, she says, they may simply decide to stay put. But what’s bad for the employee, she adds, is also bad for the employer. “Taking vacation is important for creativity and energy levels,” Palazzolo says. “They may be going through the motions at work, but not taking time off can lead to burnout.” In fact, more than half of American workers say just that — that they are burned out and overworked.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. As if there weren't enough of them in the world already, scientists have succeeded in cloning flies. The alike fruit flies are the first insects ever cloned, says the Canadian team that created them. The question everyone asks is why anyone would want to clone flies in the first place. She hopes that the insects , which are very easy to experiment with , will help to adjust the cloning process in other animals and even in humans, where the technique is being researched to aid production of therapeutic stem cells. In cloning, the DNA-containing nucleus of an adult cell is injected into an egg whose own nucleus has been removed. At the moment, the majority of cloned mice, sheep and other animals die before birth. It is thought this is because the adult DNA is not properly 'reprogrammed'. Using flies, researchers might discover genes that are important for this reprogramming, and that have matches in other animals. That is because it is relatively easy in flies to knock out the function of a single gene and then attempt cloning with these cells, which will test whether that gene is important. If such genes are confirmed, then in theory cloned mammalian embryos might be grown in selected solutions that change the activity of those genes to improve the technique's success rate. Although some groups have attempted to clone insects before, Lloyd says this is the first time it has been successful. The team used a slight difference on the standard cloning process: they transferred nuclei taken from embryos rather than fully-grown adult cells. They sucked several nuclei (pl)out of developing fly embryos, and injected them into a fertilized fly egg. From over 800 early attempts, they cloned five adult insects, the group reports in the journal Genetics. The scientists cloned flies because _ .

While it may be played by children, it is not specific to India and does not share the cultural context of Aksharit.

Suddenly he is swarmed by more children and other villagers who confront him of being a child-kidnapper. Using the event, Rekha cuts Arun's beard off, a symbol of piety. After a few more set up events, he renounces his sainthood. Later, Arun goes to work and is puzzled about why his father has been sending money to a lady named Sagaya Mary for over twenty years. The scene shifts to a parallel scenario, wherein a man informs Sagaya Mary (Kamala Kamesh) that someone has proposed to her nephew John (again Rajinikanth). When asked about John's parents, she opens up about her brother and John's father, Alex Pandian (also portrayed by Rajinikanth). A flashback ensues that explains Alex Pandian's story. Alex Pandian is a scrupulous police officer. He is ruthless on criminals and brings upon him the wrath of their mob boss, Egambaram (Senthamarai). After repeated confrontations, Egambaram kills him and as he exhales his last breadth, Alex Pandian vows that he will be born again to take revenge. When Alex Pandian dies so does his wife after giving birth to twins. Ramanathan's wife gives birth in the same hospital but the child dies, just like the other two times she had been pregnant. Sagaya Mary hands over one of Alex Pandian's twin children to them and he is christened Arun, while she raises the other child, John. On Arun's 25th birthday party he gets a divine epiphany that makes him realize he is the reincarnation of Alex Pandian. He is asked to meet a woman named Smitha at a hotel but it proves...

Which olympic cyclist was nicknamed The Flying Scotsman What is the answer?","completion":"The Olympic cyclist nicknamed \\"The Flying Scotsman\\" is Graeme Obree. Born on September 11, 1965, in Nuneaton, England, he grew up in Scotland and became a prominent track cyclist representing the country. Graeme Obree's claim to fame was his unconventional approach to cycling, which helped him achieve great success in the early 1990s. He innovated several unique cycling positions, including the \\"tuck\\" and \\"superman\\" positions, which gained attention for their aerodynamic advantages and improved his speed on the track. During his career, Obree set multiple world records: 1. On July 17, 1993, he broke the world hour record by covering 51.596 kilometers (32.034 miles) in one hour. This achievement took place at the Vikingskipet velodrome in Hamar, Norway. 2. In April 1994, he broke the world 4,000-meter individual pursuit record with a time of 4:22.668. This accomplishment took place at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Sicily, Italy. Obree also won several prestigious titles: 1. He won two gold medals at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships, claiming the individual pursuit title in 1993 and 1995. 2. He was a British national track champion in the individual pursuit for three years (1993, 1994, and 1995). In addition to his cycling career, Obree was known for building his bikes from scratch and using unconventional materials. His most famous bike, \\"Old Faithful,\\" was made using parts from a washing machine and scrap metal, showcasing his ingenuity and unique approach to cycling. Despite facing personal challenges, including struggles with mental health and a bipolar disorder diagnosis, Graeme Obree's determination and skills serve as an inspiration to many aspiring cyclists and sports enthusiasts.

Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit .

GRAPHIC IMAGES https://t.co/eq2B1N1Pn9 pic.twitter.com/wJZqYveSPr — The Siberian Times (@siberian_times) March 8, 2018 A fisherman in Siberia made a grim discovery yesterday (March 8) while walking near the icy Amur River: 27 pairs of human hands, severed at the wrist and stuffed into a bag. Russian authorities said the hands were likely disposed of by a local forensics lab, bucking proper protocol. According to the Siberian Times, the fisherman found the bag of hands on a small river island near the city of Khabarovsk, Russia, located in the country's far southeast about 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) from the Chinese border. The Amur River is a popular local fishing destination, the Times reported. Initially, the fisherman saw only one hand sticking up out of the snow there, and discovered the full bag soon after. Photos taken at the scene and shared anonymously to Russian media reveal the discovery in brutal detail. In one image, the 54 hands lie in a haphazard pile in the snow like leathery catcher's mitts, seemingly upended from the bag; in another photo, the hands have been lined up in neat rows. [27 Oddest Medical Case Reports] While many social media spectators (naturally) suspect foul play, officials from the Investigative Committee of The Russian Federation — a government agency responsible for criminal investigations — have said that the hands appear to have been improperly disposed of by a forensics lab in Khabarovsk. \\"The biological objects (hands) found are not of a criminal origin,\\" the Investigative Committee wrote in a post (as translated) on the messaging app Telegram, \\"but were disposed of in a manner not provided for by law.\\" Indeed, medical bandages and plastic hospital-style shoes were discovered near the hands. According to the Siberian Times, it's not unheard of for forensics labs in Russia to cut off the hands of unknown corpses in order to retain fingerprint information after the rest of the body has been discarded. Despite this possible explanation, investigators have been able to lift fingerprints from only one of the 27 pairs of hands. Little is known about the hands' previous owners. \\"Based on the [investigation] results, a legal assessment will be made of the actions of officials of the forensic medical institution in the city of Khabarovsk responsible for the disposal of these biological objects,\\" the Investigative Committee wrote.

Question 2: When rh+ fetal blood mixes with rh- mother's blood, there is a problem. Why doesn't this occur if the fetal blood group is different from the mother's? Possible answers: (i). no. (ii). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"No, the answers to the two questions are not the same as they address two different aspects of understanding and the consequences of blood types and Rh factors. Let's delve into this topic in detail: 1. Question 1: When and why did we evolve Rh negative blood? Rh negative blood type is a result of genetic variation and natural selection like most other human traits. The Rh stands for 'Rhesus', named after the Rhesus monkeys on which the initial tests were performed. The Rh factor is a protein that can be present on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh positive. If your blood cells don’t have it, you are Rh negative. The exact time of the 'evolution' of Rh negative blood is not known. However, the evolutionary mechanism of Rh negative blood has likely developed in geographically confined populations or could be linked to random mutation. In terms of why it evolved, like many genetic changes, it is believed to have possibly offered some sort of survival advantage to those with Rh negative blood in certain environments or situations. However, current understanding doesn't pin down a definitive evolutionary advantage of being Rh negative. It's important to acknowledge that the process of evolution involves a great deal of randomness and chance, and not all traits that evolve necessarily have a clear 'why' or purpose behind their evolution. 2. Question 2: When Rh+ fetal blood mixes with Rh- mother's blood, there is a problem. Why doesn't this occur if the fetal blood group is different from the mother's? This is due to the nature of the immune system response to Rh factors versus general blood types. In the case of a mother having Rh- blood and carrying an Rh+ baby, if fetal blood cells breach the placental barrier into the mother's circulation, her body might identify those Rh+ cells as foreign bodies. Her immune system might then produce antibodies against these cells, potentially leading to the removal and destruction of Rh+ red blood cells. This is a condition known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). It rarely occurs in first pregnancies but is more likely with subsequent pregnancies if the mother has been sensitized by the first pregnancy. On the contrary, ABO blood type differences between mother and child (e.g., a type A baby with a type O mother) could theoretically cause similar issues, but in practice, they usually don’t. This is because ABO antibodies (which people naturally produce against the A and/or B antigens if they don’t have them on their own cells) are of the IgM type, which don't cross the placenta. On the other hand, anti-Rh antibodies are IgG, which can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red cells. Overall, both questions delve into fascinating and varied aspects of human biology and genetics, each with their distinct explanations and reasons. Thus, their answers cannot be the same."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Of osage-orange and beech, which species has the same type of sapwood as black locust?\\" is in \\"The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree.

De Rust is also known for the meandering Meiringspoort pass . Meiringspoort is a gateway that connects the Klein Karoo ( little Karoo ) and the ( great ) Karoo through a gorge with a 25 km road crossing the same river 25 times in the span of the 25 km. This area is also well known for ostrich farming and most of the farmers in the area either farm exclusively with ostriches or as a sideline to their existing farming . - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - The Karoo (; from a Khoikhoi word, possibly \\"garo\\" \\"desert\\") is a semi-desert natural region of South Africa. There is no exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo, and therefore its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo is partly defined by its topography, geology, and climate above all, its low rainfall, arid air, cloudless skies, and extremes of heat and cold. The Karoo also hosted a well-preserved ecosystem hundreds of million years ago which is now represented by many fossils. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.

If you're trying to flirt with a guy who you're not romantic with yet, try to give him an opening to something romantic. That way, he'll get the idea, and if he's interested, try to steer the conversation that way. For instance, opening with \\"I had a dream about you last night!\\" is a subtle way to be flirtatious. It implies you maybe had a flirty or sexual dream about him, and if he takes it that way, you can get a more flirty conversation going. If he ignores the subtext, you'll know he's probably not that interested. Everyone likes to hear nice things about themselves, and compliments are a great way to flirt. If you're trying to start a flirty conversation, try including a flirty comment to help get the ball rolling. For instance, if you're going out with someone on the basketball team, you could write, \\"The gym sure heated up when you came on the court today!\\" Be genuine and specific. You don't have to stick to looks, but make it something specific. For instance, instead of saying, \\"You're cute,\\" you could say, \\"You have a beautiful smile.\\" Now, you probably don't want to start sending texts at 2 in the morning unless you know he's already up. Texting at night, though, can be more intimate and invite flirting. Something about the nighttime will invite you both to let loose a little. Try waiting until gets dark before you send a text. You could write, \\"I'm all snuggled up in my bed. What are you doing?\\" In a text, you may be tempted to present yourself as sillier, poutier, or more sexualized than you are in person. You really don't need to do that, especially since, if that's all he knows about you, he's going to expect a different person if you do meet. For example, you don't need to use a million exclamation marks to show how excited you are if you really aren't that excitable in real life. While you don't want to make yourself out to be something you're not, it is okay to play up your fun side in texts. Texting lends itself to shorter, lighter conversations, so bringing that side out will make him want to get to know you more. For instance, say you're spending the night home in your pajamas. Instead of texting about that, tell him about the fun night you had out last night, such as \\"Went out and had fun with the girls last night, but I kept wishing you were there.\\" Teasing can help create intimacy, as long as the guy has a sense of humor. One thing you can tease him about is a mistake he let through on one of his texts, such as a goofy autocorrect. For instance, if he sends a text that says, \\"I think your nets are sexy\\" when he probably meant \\"eyes,\\" you can tease him about it. You could say, \\"Oh, so you think my nets are sexy huh? What part of body is my nets?\\" Giving him a nickname may seem silly, but it does let him know that you like him. You stick to something more manly or go over the top with something cutesy and silly. Either way, try dropping it in a text to help him know how you feel. For instance, you could use \\"hunk\\" or \\"Thor\\" as more manly reference. For something more cutesy, you could use \\"sugar pie\\" or \\"babe.\\" Sending the same text every day at about the same time can get boring. Try breaking up your routine by sending texts at different times of day or by changing up the message so he'll stay interested. For instance, a friendly, \\"Good morning, babe!\\" is a nice way to say hello in the morning, but you wouldn't want to send that text every morning. Change it up little with texts like, \\"Wake up, sunshine!\\" or \\"Can't wait to see you at school!\\" If you see something that reminds you of him, snap a picture. Send it his way with a side note, telling him that the pic made you think about him, which will make him smile. Stick to pics of things he's interested in or inside jokes you have. Skip anything to serious, such as wedding rings or cakes. If you're texting back and forth, you need to hold up your end of the conversation. Just giving him one-word replies doesn't help out the conversation. Instead, contribute to what's being said, ask a question, or introduce a new topic if you have nothing to say. For instance, if he says, \\"So, do you like movies?\\" don't just say, \\"yes.\\" Instead, give him room to keep going, by saying something like, \\"Yes, especially when I'm seeing them with cuties like you! When are we going?\\" Alternatively, ask him a question about himself, such as \\"So what's your favorite type of food?\\" You may be tempted to start out with sexualized texts, but it's a good idea to wait a little while. In fact, it's probably a good idea to be in a relationship before you start sending sexy texts. Flirting is obviously fine, such as telling him you like his eyes. What you may want to avoid is overtly sexual texts where you start talking about genitalia and trying to engage him in sexual chat. Of course, how you text is up to you, but you may catch him off guard by sending these kinds of texts up front. Even when you're in a relationship, consider skipping the sexy pics. Once those pictures are out in the world, you can't take them back, and you have no guarantee that the other person won't release them. While sending flirtatious pictures is fine, such as blowing him a kiss, avoid anything that you wouldn't want your grandma to see if it got out on the internet--because it can get out and she could see it.","completion":"This article suggests various ways to flirt with a guy through texts, such as giving compliments, texting at night, being genuine, teasing, giving nicknames, changing up the message, sending pictures, holding up your end of the conversation, and avoiding overtly sexual texts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cash is the money we use to buy things we need or want, like toys, yummy snacks, or going to fun places. Here's a plan to get some cash: 1. Do chores at home: You can help mommy and daddy with small tasks like cleaning up your toys, making your bed, or helping to set the dinner table. They might give you some cash called \\"allowance\\" to thank you for your help. 2. Save your birthday or holiday money: When you get money as a gift on your birthday or during the holidays, you can save it in a piggy bank or a special place. This way, you can add up the cash you get and use it later when you really want to buy something. 3. Sell old toys or clothes: You can ask your parents to help you sell your old toys or clothes that you don't use anymore. You can have a yard sale or sell them online, and you'll get cash from the people who buy them. 4. Create crafts or homemade treats: With the help of your parents, you can make crafts like colorful bracelets or yummy cookies. Then, you can sell them to your friends, family, or neighbors to earn some cash. 5. Start a lemonade stand: On a sunny day, you can make a lemonade stand in front of your house with the help of your parents. You can sell cups of lemonade to the people passing by, and they will give you cash if they buy a cup of your tasty drink.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I first came across the concept of pay-what-you-can cafes last summer in Boone, N.C., where I ate at F.A.R.M (Feed All Regardless of Means) Cafe. You can volunteer to earn your meal, pay the suggested price(10) or less, or you can overpay--paying it forward for a future customer's meal. My only regret after eating there was not having a chance to give my time. So as soon as Healthy World Cafe opened in York in April, I signed up for a volunteer shift . F.A.R.M and healthy World are part of a growing trend of community cafes. In 2003, Denise Cerreta opened the first in Salt Lake City. Cerreta now runs the One World Everybody Eats Foundation, helping others copy her pay-what-you can model. \\"I think the community cafe is truly a hand up, not a handout,\\" Cerreta said. She acknowledged that soup kitchens have a place in society, but people typically don't feel good about going there. \\"One of the values of the community cafe is that we have another approach,\\" she said. \\"Everyone eats here, no one needs to know whether you volunteered, overpaid or underpaid.\\" The successful cafes not only address hunger and food insecurity but also become necessary parts of their neighborhood -- whether it's a place to learn skills or hear live music. Some teach cooking to seniors; some offer free used books. Eating or working there is a reminder that we are all in this world together. My 10 am-1pm shift at World-Healthy-Cafe began with the cafe manager -- one of the two paid staff members. Our volunteer crew wasn't the most orderly, but we managed to prepare and serve meals with a lot of laughs in between. At the end of my shift, I ordered my earned meal at the counter, together with other volunteers.

If \\"An elderly man swims with others.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person swimming.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A person is swimming\\" based on the given statement, \\"An elderly man swims with others.\\" Here's an explanation of why this is true: First, let's break down the given statement: \\"An elderly man swims with others.\\" 1. An elderly man: This phrase implies that there is, indeed, a man who is considered elderly. This man is the primary subject of the statement. 2. Swims: This verb signifies that the action taking place is swimming. The elderly man is engaging in the activity of swimming. By definition, swimming is an action typically performed by a person who moves through water by moving their limbs. 3. With others: This phrase means that the elderly man is not swimming alone; he is accompanied by other individuals. The word \\"others\\" implies that there could be multiple people involved, but it doesn't specify the exact number or nature of these individuals (whether they are also elderly, young, male, female, etc.). Now, let's consider the statement that we want to check for logical validity: \\"A person is swimming.\\" In order to determine whether this statement logically follows from the given statement, we can ask ourselves the following question: Is it true that at least one person is swimming based on the information provided in the given statement? The answer is yes. Since the given statement mentions that an elderly man is swimming with others, we already have the presence of at least one person involved in the activity of swimming – the elderly man himself is considered a person. When the statement also mentions \\"with others,\\" we can infer that there are additional people involved in the swimming activity. However, even without considering the \\"others,\\" the presence of the elderly man is enough to conclude that a person is swimming. In summary, based on the given statement (\\"An elderly man swims with others.\\"), it logically follows that \\"A person is swimming.\\" The key to this conclusion is understanding that an elderly man is considered a person, and the action of swimming confirms that a person is engaging in the swimming activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora? , can you please find it? Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

Question: This article: Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \\"Christianity will go,\\" Lennon had said. \\"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \\"Bible Belt\\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

Select the topic that this about: Marsh amp; McLennan Cos. #39; new boss Michael Cherkasky may be the prototype of the new CEO -- where the E stands for enforcement.","completion":"Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc.'s new CEO Michael Cherkasky is an embodiment of the growing trend towards businesses adopting a regulatory and enforcement-driven approach in their management strategies. Cherkasky, given his background in compliance and enforcement, is an excellent example of the type of leader companies are seeking to navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Cherkasky's career and leadership style provide valuable insights into the increasing importance of regulatory compliance and corporate governance in today's business world. His background as a prosecutor, coupled with his time spent working in the private sector in risk management and consulting roles, lends him a unique perspective on the challenges posed by the intersection of corporate strategy and regulatory enforcement. As a former prosecutor and chief of the investigations division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Cherkasky had a strong record in the realm of law enforcement. During his tenure, he prosecuted white collar crimes and organized crime, developing a keen understanding of the methods used by criminals to exploit weaknesses in corporate governance and compliance programs. This experience has likely informed his approach to corporate leadership, placing a strong emphasis on the importance of robust compliance and ethical conduct. After leaving the public sector, Cherkasky joined Kroll Inc., a global risk consulting company, as the president and CEO. His leadership at Kroll further solidified his credentials in the corporate world, where he led the company to significant growth and eventual acquisition by Marsh & McLennan Companies in 2004. This merger brought Cherkasky to Marsh & McLennan, eventually leading him to his current role as the CEO. Given the various challenges related to corporate governance and compliance, companies are now seeking leaders who possess both the knowledge and experience to navigate these complex issues. Cherkasky's background and experiences make him the prototype for the next generation of CEOs, where the \\"E\\" stands for enforcement. The following factors have contributed to the rise of CEOs like Michael Cherkasky: 1. Increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement: Government bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice, have ramped up enforcement actions on corporate compliance, emphasizing the importance of proactive and comprehensive risk management strategies. CEOs with enforcement experience are more likely to understand the importance of preempting potential risks and addressing them effectively. 2. Growing complexity of global operations: As businesses grow and operate in an increasingly connected global market, their exposure to varied regulatory environments increases. The need for a robust and sophisticated compliance infrastructure becomes paramount to mitigating risks and ensuring seamless operations. Leaders with experience in the realm of enforcement are better equipped to build and maintain such infrastructures. 3. Corporate scandals and greater demand for ethical leadership: High-profile corporate scandals have resulted in a loss of trust in business leaders. Stakeholders now demand greater transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct from corporations. CEOs with a strong background in enforcement and compliance are seen as more likely to prioritize ethical behavior and maintain a strong compliance culture within their organizations. In conclusion, the appointment of Michael Cherkasky as the CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies marks a significant development in the business world, as it highlights the increasing demand for executives with a strong background in regulatory enforcement. Company leadership now requires a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding corporate governance and compliance, and Cherkasky's background and experience make him an excellent example of the next generation of CEOs. Such leaders are better equipped to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of regulatory enforcement and maintain a strong culture of ethical conduct within their organizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sarcopenia is a natural physiological process that occurs as people age, and it can affect both their physical health and overall quality of life. The term sarcopenia is derived from the Greek words \\"sarx,\\" meaning flesh, and \\"penia,\\" meaning poverty or deficiency. This decline in muscle mass and strength typically begins around the age of 30 and progresses more rapidly after the age of 60. Sarcopenia can be attributed to several factors, including: 1. Hormonal changes: As people age, hormonal production declines, particularly the hormones testosterone and estrogen, which play a crucial role in maintaining muscle mass and strength. Additionally, the decrease in human growth hormone (HGH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) can lead to reduced muscle synthesis. 2. Neuromuscular changes: Aging is associated with a loss of motor neurons, which results in decreased neural stimulation of muscle fibers. This decline in neural input can contribute to muscle atrophy and reduced muscle strength. 3. Reduced physical activity: As people get older, their overall level of physical activity often decreases. This reduction in activity can lead to muscle disuse and, subsequently, further muscle loss. 4. Nutritional factors: Older adults may have reduced nutrient intake, especially protein, due to changes in appetite, taste perception, and digestion. Inadequate protein intake can hinder the body's ability to repair and build muscle tissues. 5. Chronic inflammation: Age-related inflammation can contribute to muscle breakdown and impair the body's ability to regenerate muscle tissues. The consequences of sarcopenia include: 1. Decreased functional capacity: With reduced muscle mass and strength, activities of daily living, such as climbing stairs, carrying groceries, and maintaining balance, can become increasingly difficult. 2. Increased risk of falls and injuries: Muscle weakness and poor balance are associated with a higher risk of falls, which can result in fractures and other injuries. 3. Loss of independence: As sarcopenia progresses, older adults may become more reliant on others for assistance with daily tasks, reducing their independence and overall quality of life. 4. Increased risk of chronic diseases: Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. To reduce the risk and progression of sarcopenia, it is essential to incorporate regular physical activity, particularly resistance training, into one's routine. Additionally, consuming adequate amounts of protein and maintaining a balanced diet can help support muscle health. Other strategies include managing chronic conditions to reduce inflammation and consulting healthcare providers regarding hormonal therapies or interventions if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the original name of the structure that Titus inaugurated the completion of? from the following article ? The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus. Answer:","completion":"The original name of the structure that Titus inaugurated the completion of was the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence fragment \\"from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal\\" seems to have a positive sentiment. Here's why: 1. The use of the term \\"charismatic\\". Charisma is universally viewed as an attractive trait, therefore the use of this term implies a positive sentiment. 2. \\"Rising star\\" is another term with positive connotations. It implies that Jake Gyllenhaal is gaining popularity and is well-regarded in his field. 3. The use of \\"Jake Gyllenhaal\\", in this context, is likely well-known or noteworthy, which again contributes to the positive sentiment. However, this is only a fragment of a sentence, and assessing the sentiment could be more accurate if we had the sentence in full. Because phrases and words can change value based upon their context, the full sentence might change the overall sentiment. Nonetheless, based on this fragment alone, it implies a positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

When one of the bottles begins to emit an eerie supernatural glow, Mears tells Petrie \\"They've found us again.\\" Knowing an evil presence is there, they decide to fight it. Two years earlier, in the small town of Salem's Lot (formally known as Jerusalem's Lot) in Maine in the United States, Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker (James Mason), has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller (Marie Windsor), and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton (Bonnie Bedelia). He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton (Ed Flanders), and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke (Lew Ayres). Mears tells Burke that he feels the Marsten House is somehow inherently evil, and recalls how he was once traumatized inside the house when he was a child. After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker's mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow (Reggie Nalder), an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival.

A:","completion":"\\"Feel comfortable\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the primary reason someone wants to get warm when they are cold. When our bodies are exposed to cold temperatures, various physiological responses occur, such as shivering or the constriction of blood vessels, in an attempt to maintain our core body temperature. These reactions can cause discomfort, making us feel uneasy, stiff, and generally uncomfortable. By getting warm, we can alleviate this discomfort and return our body to a more balanced state, which is commonly referred to as feeling comfortable. Humans naturally seek comfort, and maintaining an optimal body temperature falls within this pursuit. The other provided answers, such as \\"to do somersaults,\\" \\"you're cold,\\" \\"were cold,\\" and \\"more comfortable,\\" are either unrelated or partially related to the primary reason for seeking warmth.

Write an article that answers the following question: How did the revolutionaries think the battle would go?","completion":"Title: The Revolutionaries' Vision: How They Forecasted the Battle's Outcome Introduction: The revolutionary period was marked by an ardent desire for freedom, justice, and equality. The revolutionaries were bold and idealistic, fighting against inequality and tyranny. As battles and uprisings unfolded, these impassioned individuals had their unique perspectives on how the conflicts might unfold. In this article, we explore the thoughts of revolutionaries on the anticipated course of the battle and the factors that influenced their perspective. 1. Revolutionaries' optimism and belief in their cause: Revolutionaries often displayed unwavering confidence in the righteousness of their cause. They firmly believed that their actions would lead to a victorious outcome. Their optimism stemmed from the conviction that the masses' collective power would be enough to overthrow corrupt governments and usher in new, just societies. The revolutionaries’ optimism fueled their dedication and resilience in battle, enabling them to persevere and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. 2. The influence of revolutionary leaders: Charismatic leaders, such as George Washington in the American Revolution or Vladimir Lenin in the Russian Revolution, played a pivotal role in shaping the revolutionaries' mindset. These influential figures inspired their followers by presenting clear visions of future success and instilling a sense of purpose and unity. The revolutionaries trusted and admired their leaders, which bolstered their confidence in triumphing over their adversaries. 3. The impact of previous victories and setbacks: The outcomes of past battles often significantly influenced how the revolutionaries estimated the future course of the struggle. When revolutionary forces emerged victorious, such as the French Revolution’s storming of the Bastille, hope and determination surged among fighters and supporters. These moments of triumph reinforced the idea that their cause was destined to succeed. Conversely, when the tide turned against the revolutionaries, as it did during the American Revolution's initial stages where the Continental Army suffered significant losses, they were compelled to regroup, reevaluate their strategies, and bolster their resolve. Setbacks made the revolutionaries more pragmatic and forced them to adapt to new challenges. 4. The role of international alliances: The stance of foreign nations significantly influenced how revolutionaries perceived the battle's trajectory. For instance, the American revolutionaries recognized their dependence on assistance from France, which proved pivotal in securing their ultimate victory. Revolutionaries closely observed the international landscape, seeking alliances to bolster their chances for success. The promise of international support elevated their morale and enhanced their expectations for a favorable outcome. 5. Revolutionary propaganda: Revolutionaries were adept at using propaganda to garner support, rally the masses, and sustain morale. Dramatizations of revolutionary victories often emphasized the underdog's triumph over their oppressors and framed the struggle as a moral imperative. These narratives instilled a sense of inevitability in the revolution’s ultimate success, shaping the revolutionaries' thoughts about how the battle would progress. Conclusion: The revolutionaries in various historical uprisings held diverse perspectives on their battles' predicted outcomes. These viewpoints were shaped by the strength in their cause, leadership, past successes and failures, international alliances, and propaganda. Revolutionaries consistently displayed a determination to persist despite the odds, enabling them to emerge victorious in many instances. Their unwavering belief in the righteousness of their cause and the desire for a better future propelled them forward to forge new, more equitable societies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They contacted the property's engineering three times before receiving a response, however, the assistance provided was off-base as it pertained to an issue with the air conditioning unit rather than the key card - the real issue.

By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, Domenico Montanaro, and Brooke Brower Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images President Barack Obama speaks following a meeting with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in the Oval Office of the White House on May 31, 2013 in Washington, DC. *** Scattershot: Beginning the sixth month of his second term in office, President Obama today hosts -- along with Vice President Biden -- a daylong White House conference on mental health. This comes after Friday’s event on student loans, last Tuesday’s trip to New Jersey to talk about rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy, and the even earlier national-security speech at the National Defense University. And these different events raise this question: What is the White House’s overall message? Because right now it’s all over the place. The above events are all worthy, don’t get us wrong. But they seem disconnected from whatever larger narrative the president offered up in January during his inaugural and State of the Union. Team Obama seems like it’s doing plenty of one-day events, but it’s lacking a larger, well, vision thing. To be sure, the IRS/Benghazi/leak controversies have put the White House on the defensive over the last three weeks. But what is the larger message? That the economy is improving and the budget deficit is getting smaller? (The president hasn’t really leaned into those arguments, almost as if fearing he does, something bad will happen in the economy.) That immigration reform is necessary? (The White House is letting Congress work its will on the legislation, staying quiet so Republicans can deal with their internal politics without interference on this issue.) That Republicans and Democrats need to come together on the budget? (When is the last time we’ve heard the president speak on that topic? *** Why not go bold? The White House tells us that June will be about student loans and immigration (through the Senate), plus foreign affairs (meeting with China’s president in California, heading to the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, going to Africa later this month). But here’s a second question we have for the White House: As it finds itself playing defense on the IRS controversy, why isn’t it also playing offense -- to seem like is trying to fix dysfunctional Washington? Why nothing on civil-servant reform? Why nothing on tax reform? Why not go big and bold on something or multiple things? The White House seems to be acting as if it’s powerless to really change things in Washington, which is one way to act if you are in the seventh or eighth year of a presidency. Of course, the White House would dispute the idea it’s given up on going big. But as the summer kicks in, it will only put more pressure on the White House to get its mojo back in the fall. *** GOP’s message is all over the place, too: If the White House’s message has been all over the place the last few weeks, so has the Republican Party’s. On the Sunday shows yesterday, Republicans hit the Obama administration on the IRS and leak-investigation controversies, but there was barely a word about Benghazi -- which happened to be the subject that kicked off the trio of controversies. Regarding the IRS, Republicans are divided on their line of attack. Was the Obama White House responsible for the IRS targeting of conservative-sounding groups? Or was it asleep at the wheel? But it can’t be both of those things. And regarding the Justice Department’s seizure of reporters’ phone records to investigate national-security leaks, Republicans (and now even some Democrats) are calling for Attorney General Eric Holder to step down. Yet don’t forget that Republicans were the ones who complained about national-security leaks and demanded investigations into them. All of these various and sundry GOP complaints seem to validate the argument coming from many Democrats -- that Republicans are simply throwing whatever they can against the wall to see what sticks. And House Oversight and Government Reform Chair Darrell Issa (R-CA) calling White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a “paid liar” only furthers that impression. *** This is what you get during second terms: But given these scattershot messages, here’s an important reminder: This is normally what you get during second terms. Your authors have covered two previous second terms -- Clinton’s and Bush’s. Both presidents tried to push a big domestic priority (education/child care for Clinton, Social Security privatization for Bush), and both failed. During those second terms, the political opposition threw the kitchen sink at the White House (Lewinsky/impeachment for Clinton, Iraq/Katrina for Bush). And these former presidents found their second terms reduced to locking in their first-term accomplishments, building on their legacies, and getting their judicial nominations cleared through Congress. *** Unrest in Turkey: Here is the world’s biggest story today: “Anger and resentment boiled over onto the street over the past three days [in Istanbul, Turkey], as the police barraged demonstrators with tear gas and streams from water cannons — and as the protesters attacked bulldozers and construction trailers lined up next to the last park in the city’s center,” the New York Times says. “In full public view, a long struggle over urban spaces is erupting as a broader fight over Turkish identity, where difficult issues of religion, social class and politics intersect. And while most here acknowledge that every Turkish ruling class has sought to put its stamp on Istanbul, there is a growing sense that none has done so as insistently as the current government, led by [Prime Minister] Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, despite growing resistance.” *** Eric Holder on the hot seat, again: As we alluded to above, Attorney General Eric Holder is receiving political heat, which is nothing new. But this time, some of it is coming from Democrats. The Sunday Times: “Over the course of four and a half years, no other member of President Obama’s cabinet has been at the center of so many polarizing episodes or the target of so much criticism. While the White House publicly backed Mr. Holder as he tried to smooth over the latest uproar amid new speculation about his future, some in the West Wing privately tell associates they wish he would step down, viewing him as politically maladroit. But the latest attacks may stiffen the administration’s resistance in the near term to a change for fear of emboldening critics.” Holder’s tenure has always been divisive inside the West Wing and that fact is now breaking out into the open with more blind quotes about Holder circulating this week. At the end of the first term, Holder had told the White House he wanted to stay on for just one more year (or so), which the president agreed to even as some of his political aides hoped differently. Replacing an AG is never easy, and of all the cabinet agencies, Justice is the hardest to “force” someone out (just ask Bill Clinton who failed to push Janet Reno out for YEARS). *** IRS remains in the news: Meanwhile, the IRS’s troubles aren’t going away. “The Internal Revenue Service spent an estimated 49 million on at least 220 conferences for employees over a three-year span beginning in fiscal 2010, according to a forthcoming report that will prompt fresh scrutiny of the already embattled agency,” the Washington Post reported on Sunday. “The findings come as the Obama administration is overhauling the agency after officials said dozens of groups were inappropriately scrutinized as they sought tax-exempt status. The admission forced the resignation of the agency’s acting commissioner and has sparked criminal and congressional investigations.” More from the paper: “[A]cting IRS commissioner Daniel Werfel acknowledged the report in a statement late Friday, but he did not share any of the findings. He called the spending ‘an unfortunate vestige from a prior era’ and said the agency has significantly curtailed conference spending in recent years.” In addition, per NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell, Issa’s committee has released a partial transcript of interviews between GOP congressional investigators and Cincinnati IRS employers. According to the GOP-run committee, one Cincy employee pointed to Washington, DC as being responsible for the targeting effort. (But Washington doesn’t necessarily mean White House.) And at 3:00 pm ET, the House Appropriations Committee holds another hearing on the IRS. *** Immigration bill to reach Senate floor on June 10: On “Meet the Press” yesterday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said none of the controversies is affecting the immigration debate. “Well, first we're going to put immigration on the floor starting on June 10. I predict it will pass the Senate by July 4. We're hoping to get 70 votes, up to 70 votes, which means a lot of Republicans. And we're willing to entertain amendments that don't damage the core principles of the bill, but improve the bill, just as we did in committee.” Schumer went on to say, “These so-called scandals have not diverted us one iota. You have, on the Gang of Eight, three of the people who have been most critical of the president on some of these other issues. But I think the eight of us realize how important this is, more important probably than any of these scandals, to the future of America, for job growth, for the middle class.” *** GOP report: Republicans have challenge winning over younger votes: Politico reports on a post-election study by the College Republican National Committee -- being released today -- which is “sharply critical of the GOP on several fronts [when it comes to wooing young voters]. The study slams some Republicans’ almost singular focus on downsizing Big Government and cutting taxes; candidates’ use of offensive, polarizing rhetoric; and the party’s belly-flop efforts at messaging and outreach, even as the report presents a way forward and, at times, strikes an optimistic tone.” *** Don’t miss this story: If you have time today, be sure to read this fascinating -- and long -- look by Buzzfeed at the conflict inside one of the Republican Party’s top consulting firms. *** The GOP’s built-in midterm advantage: Lastly, the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman makes an important point about the upcoming 2014 midterms: The GOP is favored to make gains -- but it has little to do with the political environment or the so-called “six-year itch” that hits the party controlling the White House. Wasserman writes, “Midterm elections have always drawn older voters, and usually drawn white voters, to the polls in disproportionate numbers. Older voters are less transient, have grown deeper roots in their local communities, and pay much more attention to non-presidential elections than their younger counterparts. In the 1980s, that didn't hold partisan consequences. Today, that amounts to a built-in midterm turnout advantage for Republicans.” Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

President Obama's second term has seen a multitude of disconnected events, while the GOP has been divided on various issues. Both parties have also struggled with controversies, such as the IRS targeting scandal and leak-investigation. Amidst the scattershot messaging, significant global events continue to unfold, such as the unrest in Turkey, which has evolved into a broader fight on Turkish identity involving religion, social class, and politics. While immigration bills are set to appear on the Senate floor, the GOP faces challenges in winning over younger voters, as revealed in a post-election study by the College Republican National Committee. The study highlights the party's difficulties with messaging and outreach, as well as the offensive language used by some Republicans. In the upcoming midterm elections, the GOP is favored to make gains, not due to the political environment or the six-year itch, but rather due to the built-in turnout advantage for Republicans, as midterm elections disproportionately draw older and white voters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. Let us break down the sentence to determine the reasons for perceiving it negatively. 1. \\"All three descriptions suit Evelyn\\" - This statement implies that there are three qualities or characteristics that have been mentioned previously in the review, which are attributed to the movie. Although we don't have access to these descriptions, it is clear that these identified aspects are not positive since the following part of the sentence offers criticism. 2. \\"A besotted and obvious drama\\" - The term 'besotted' generally refers to being infatuated or obsessed with something, but in this context, it is likely meant to imply that the movie is overly sentimental, heavy-handed, or excessively focused on its dramatic elements, to the point where it becomes a drawback. The word 'obvious' further emphasizes that the movie is predictable and lacks subtlety in its storytelling, which are negative qualities in the eyes of the reviewer. 3. \\"That tells us nothing new\\" - This phrase clearly indicates that the movie fails to provide fresh or original content to the audience. The reviewer perceives the movie to be reiterating concepts, themes, or ideas that have been seen before, which adds to their negative view of the film. In summary, the reviewer sees the movie, Evelyn, in a negative light. This is mainly due to its overly-dramatic nature, predictability, and lack of originality. The critical tone of the statement in the review suggests that they did not enjoy the movie and would not recommend it to others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said.

Plot title: It Came from Beneath the Sea Movie plot: A nuclear submarine on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean, captained by Commander Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), comes into contact with a massive sonar return. The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify. Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for government officials, who then have the evidence they need. The U.S. government halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up on a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon.

The cytoskeleton, a network of various protein filaments and tubules, plays a crucial role in cell shape, organization, and movement. Motor proteins interact with the cytoskeleton to drive cell motility. These proteins use ATP to perform mechanical work, such as moving along the cytoskeleton's structure or causing its components to slide against each other. There are various types of motor proteins like myosin, kinesin and dynein, and they interact with different parts of the cytoskeleton. For example, myosin interacts with actin filaments, whereas kinesin and dynein move along microtubules. These proteins move along the cytoskeleton toward the positive or negative end, thereby creating generating force and movement. This interaction between motor proteins and the cytoskeleton is essential for cell movement, hence the correct answer to your question is 'interaction'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - John Henry Bonham (31 May 1948 25 September 1980) was an English drummer, musician and songwriter, best known as the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast bass-drumming, distinctive sound, and \\"feel\\" for the groove. He is considered by some publications to be one of the greatest drummers in rock. - The gittern was a relatively small gut strung round-backed instrument that first appears in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum, as we can see clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century. It was also called the guitarra in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and quintern in Germany. A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered ancestral to the modern guitar; possibly other instruments like the mandore and gallichon. - In Through the Out Door is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, and their final album of entirely new material. It was recorded over a three-week period in November and December 1978 at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and released by Swan Song Records on 15 August 1979. \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was the band's eighth and final studio release to reach the top of the charts in America, and was the last released by the band before the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980. - ABBA (stylised ) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to ever take part in the competition. - Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product. - Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\" - \`\` Carouselambra '' is the fifth track on Led Zeppelin 's 1979 album In Through the Out Door . The name Carouselambra is a reference to the first section of the song sounding similar to carousel music . It is the second - longest song the band recorded in the studio ( after \`\` In My Time of Dying '' ) , clocking in at more than 10 minutes in length . It 's also a very unusual song for the band , as Jimmy Page 's guitar work is pushed almost to the background , while John Paul Jones dominates with heavy use of synthesizers . - Polar Studios was a recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden, which operated from 1978 through 2004.

The \\"seats\\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, horseabout and flying horses. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Robert Anthony Plant, (born 20 August 1948) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin. A powerful and wide vocal range (particularly evident in his high-pitched vocals) has given him a successful solo career spanning over 30 years. Plant is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll; he has influenced fellow rock singers such as Freddie Mercury, Axl Rose and Chris Cornell. In 2006, Heavy Metal magazine \\"Hit Parader\\" named Plant the \\"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\\". In 2009, Plant was voted \\"the greatest voice in rock\\" in a poll conducted by \\"Planet Rock\\". In 2008, \\"Rolling Stone\\" editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time. In 2011, \\"Rolling Stone\\" readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers. - American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word \\"zeppelin\\" came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights.

We are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the American pilot. If you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. I truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this review is predominantly positive.

Die prekären Kulturproduzenten sind häufig in verschiedenen kreativen Bereichen tätig, wie zum Beispiel in den Bereichen Kunst, Musik, Film, Theater, Literatur oder Design.

This leads to Siddharth's childhood love interest Radha (Ameesha Patel), becoming jealous but she immediately recovers. Siddharth is crowned as the king, his right to the throne. The palace where Siddharth and Avni were staying was once occupied by Raja Vibhuti Narayan, who was Siddharth's ancestor. He had fallen in love with Manjulika, an Odissi dancer hailing from Bengal.

On the night of Durgashtami, when the king gets to know of the affair and their plan to elope, he calls them to perform a dance one last time in the court. In the end, the king beheads Shashidhar and imprisons Manjulika in her room. Then on the day of the king's marriage, Manjulika hangs herself and swore that her spirit would not leave any king who lived in that very palace. Various omens started taking place after that, presuming that the \\"evil eye\\" may have befallen on the king. The king too dies under unknown circumstances.

Manjulika's tragic story began when she fell in love with Shashidhar, another dancer, as they would often meet secretly behind the palace. Raja Vibhuti Narayan, an ancestor of Siddharth, was also in love with Manjulika. Upon discovering the affair between Manjulika and Shashidhar, Raja Vibhuti Narayan called them to perform a dance in the court. At the end of the performance, the king beheaded Shashidhar and imprisoned Manjulika in her room.

Options are: --send a letter to the police station; --file a police report.;","completion":"Option two, which is to file a police report, makes the most sense to accomplish the said task of reporting something being stolen to the police. Here's why: Reporting something stolen involves providing key information that is likely time-sensitive and could vary depending on the specific items stolen and the circumstances surrounding the theft. Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be different methods for reporting a stolen item, but they generally involve the following steps: 1. Determine Your Loss: First, you should ascertain what's been stolen. Look for other missing items, calculate their worth, and gather as much information as possible like serial numbers, brands, and any unique features they may have. 2. Contact the Police: Next, you should contact the local police department. You could call them or go there in person. Some jurisdictions even permit online filing of police reports for certain kinds of crimes. 3. Provide Detailed Information: You will need to provide a detailed account of the incident. This should include where and when it happened, descriptions of the stolen items, and any other details that could help identify the thief or recover the stolen goods. 4. Submit the Report: Once you've provided all the necessary information, you'll submit your report. It'll then be reviewed by officers who will decide the best course of action. Typically, a case number will be given to you after submission. 5. Follow-up: Keep in touch with the police department and provide any additional information or materials they may request. This could include pictures of the stolen items, for example. Sending a letter is another way you could potentially notify the police of the theft, but this is not the best method. First, it may take several days for the letter to reach its recipient. Even once it arrives, there may be additional delay before it's read and acted upon. In contrast, filing a police report, whether in person, over the phone, or online, allows for immediate notification and action. Moreover, the letter won't give the police a chance to ask you questions and obtain further details during the conversation. It might also lack crucial information, leading to ineffective investigation. If you're reporting a theft in progress or just occurred, speed is crucial, and a letter doesn't offer this. Lastly, the formality of a police report ensures your complaint is recorded properly in the system and tracked. A letter doesn't have the same degree of formality and criticality in terms of legal proceedings. Overall, reporting a stolen item involves much more than simply notifying the police. It requires an exchange of pertinent information that may play a crucial role in recovering the stolen property or prosecuting the perpetrator, and that's why filing a report is more beneficial and efficient than sending a letter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But in a recent league table, a European country, Finland, was top of the class. South Korea was still in second place, though. Britain was at number 6. In Korea the school day is long--typically 7 or 8 hours, followed by hours of private tutoring in the evenings. _ leaves Korean students so tired, they sometimes fall asleep in class next day. Worries about the effects of late night cramming led the government to force cramming schools to close by 10 p.m. Finnish children spend the least time in class in the developed world, often finishing just after lunch, with about one hour of homework a day. Private tuition is uncommon. The British and American school day is quite long in comparison, around 6 hours, and secondary school pupils do 2 or 3 hours of selfstudy a night. The Korean education system, like many in Asia, is intensely competitive, with students even competing to get into the best cramming schools, to help them get ahead. Finnish education is far less cutthroat. Classes are all mixed ability, and there are no league tables. British schools again occupy the middle ground, with quite high levels of competition for places at university, and schools and universities battling to come top of league tables for everything from exam results to student satisfaction. Korea and Finland both do well, yet their education systems are so different. However, there are some similarities between Korea and Finland. In those countries, teachers have high status in society, and education is very highly valued. Those attitudes can't change quickly. But it can be done. They might be the star pupils now, but until the 1970s, Finland's education system was poor. Their thoroughly different approach to schooling has taken them to the top in just a generation.

Dubuffet also traveled to Italy and Brazil, and upon returning to Le Havre in 1925, he married for the first time and went on to start a small wine business in Paris. He took up painting again in 1934 when he made a large series of portraits in which he emphasized the vogues in art history.

The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s. - Joseph Fernand Henri Léger (February 4, 1881 August 17, 1955) was a French painter, sculptor, and filmmaker. In his early works he created a personal form of cubism which he gradually modified into a more figurative, populist style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter has caused him to be regarded as a forerunner of pop art. - Abstract expressionism is a postWorld War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term \\"abstract expressionism\\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine \\"Der Sturm\\", regarding German Expressionism. In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.

A man whose teen step-daughter was allegedly shot dead by three soldiers to protect an anti-government militia group rushed and yelled at one of the suspects as he appeared in court on Thursday. Private Isaac Aguigui, Private Christopher Salmon and Sergeant Anthony Peden - all active-duty soldiers stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia - appeared separately in court as the District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for each suspect. Wesley Thomas, whose 17-year-old daughter Tiffany York was killed alongside her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, last year, bolted from his seat in the courtroom and rushed one of the suspects, Peden. 'You killed my kid!' he screamed before officers wrestled him to the floor, handcuffed him and led away, alongside Roark's father, Brett, who called one of the soldiers, 'Piece of (expletive).' Anger: Wesley Thomas, whose stepdaughter was shot dead by three soldiers last December, is tackled by courtroom security during the hearing of one of her murderers. Swipe: Thomas was wrestled to the ground and led out of court - but was not charged for the outburst. Both men were led out of the courtroom, but neither was charged for the outburst. Thomas, Salmon and Peden are each charged with 13 counts including malice murder, felony murder and illegal gang activity in the December 4 slayings. The victims were shot in the head in the woods of rural Long County near Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia. Fishermen found their bodies the day after they were killed. 'I want them gone. I want all of these individuals to disappear,' said Nicholas Lee York, Tiffany's brother, who applauded the decision to seek death for the soldiers. 'They took something irreplaceable from me.' Hate: As he tried to reach the defendant, Thomas yelled: 'You (expletive) killed my kid!' Victims: Tiffany York, 17, and her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, were shot dead by three soldiers who wanted to protect their anti-government militia and their plans to assassinate the president. The case took a stunning turn at an. earlier hearing Monday when prosecutors told a Superior Court judge the. accused soldiers belonged to an anti-government militia operating within. the U.S. military that had stockpiled at least 87,000 worth of guns. and bomb components. They. said the group had a range of plans - from bombing a park fountain in. nearby Savannah to poisoning apple crops in the state of Washington -. and its ultimate goal was to overthrow the U.S. government and. assassinate the president. President Barack Obama was not mentioned by name as their target. Atlantic. Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden cites domestic terrorism. as an aggravating factor that warrants the death penalty. But. all charges against the soldiers relate directly to the killings. No. charges have been filed in state or federal court accusing the three. suspects of terrorist plots or acts. Fight: Brett Roark, the father of Michael Roark, is escorted out by courtroom security during the hearing. Heartbreak: Brett Roark is escorted out by courtroom security during the hearing of a defendant. 'Sometimes some of these things don't. fit neatly into our state laws,' Durden said after court when asked. about the absence of terrorism-related charges. \\"We're going forward. with what we feel comfortable with.\\" Because. they now face capital charges, all three soldiers will need to have new. attorneys appointed with death penalty experience. They won't be. arraigned or asked to enter pleas until that happens. 'At. this point, there has been no evidence presented to prove anything,' said Keith Higgins, an attorney who represented Aguigui in court. Thursday. 'The fact that certain statements are being made does not. necessarily mean these allegations are true.' Salmon's. wife, Heather Salmon, has also been charged with murder and other. counts. She did not appear in court Thursday and Durden said he will not. seek the death penalty for her. Target: The ruckus took place as Sgt. Anthony Peden appeared at Long County Superior Court. Accused: Isaac Aguigui has also been accused of murder to cover up plans to bring down the government. In court: Christopher Salmon walks into court. The District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for all three. Authorities. took extra precautions Thursday as the accused soldiers, in shackles. and jailhouse jumpsuits, were brought before the judge for a preliminary. hearing. The defendants were brought to the courthouse one-at-a-time, with their hearings scheduled an hour apart. Deputies armed with assault rifles walked in front of and behind them. Relatives of both victims have been seething since Monday's hearing after a fourth soldier who says he witnessed both slayings testified about them in detail before pleading guilty to reduced charges. Pfc. Michael Burnett told the judge Roark, whom prosecutors say was helping the militia buy guns, had just left the Army and was considered 'a loose end' by Aguigui, the militia's leader. Burnett said Roark and his girlfriend were led to the woods. Peden shot York before she could get out of her car, Burnett testified, then paused to check her pulse and shot her again. Struggle: Wesley Thomas comforts his wife Brenda Thomas during the hearing of Pvt. Isaac Aguigui. Roark was forced to kneel on the ground before Salmon shot him twice in the head, Burnett said. The Army brought its own murder charges in the case in March, but dropped them earlier this month. Civilian federal prosecutors won't say if they're building a case. Durden, the state prosecutor, says he doesn't know how many other members belonged to the militia, which prosecutors say was called F.E.A.R. - Forever Enduring Always Ready. Army authorities have indicated they don't believe the suspects were part of a large group.

If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: how rare are cardiac issues with amitriptyline Suggestion: It is also known to reduce aggression and violent behavior.","completion":"False The suggested answer does not address the question about the rarity of cardiac issues associated with amitriptyline. Instead, it discusses the drug's effect on aggression and violent behavior. To provide a more appropriate answer to the question, one should talk about the potential side effects of amitriptyline on the cardiovascular system. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is used to treat various mental/mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Although it is generally considered safe when taken under a doctor's supervision, it can sometimes cause cardiac issues, particularly in individuals who have pre-existing heart conditions or risk factors. Some potential cardiac side effects of amitriptyline include irregular heartbeat, a change in heart rhythm (prolonged QT interval), or increased blood pressure. These side effects are relatively rare and are usually dose-dependent, meaning that they may be more likely to occur at higher doses of the drug. Doctors generally monitor patients taking amitriptyline to ensure that they are on the appropriate dosage and to detect any potential cardiac issues early on. In summary, the suggested answer does not properly address the question about cardiac issues associated with amitriptyline; therefore, the correct answer is \\"False\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[II] Adam is arty..","completion":"Derrick is arty. Being arty, Derrick displayed an innate inclination towards music and arts. This predisposition of his was a significant contributing factor in him finding the glockenspiel easy to pick up. A creative personality goes hand in hand with a distinct ability to grasp the rhythm and melody involved in musical instruments. An artsy individual like Derrick views the world through a lens of creativity, finding complexity unscrambled and patterns visible where others don't. His arty side gave him the ability to understand and appreciate the beauty of music intrinsically and naturally. As soon as Derrick laid his hands on the glockenspiel, he was instinctively drawn to the unique timbre and pitch that the instrument produces. Inspiring a mélange of creativity and curiosity within him, it opened a new door to artistic expression. He found the melody and rhythm resonating within the very core of his being, connecting deeply with his creative spirit. Each note on the glockenspiel was like an artist's palette for him - a means to create unique, creative blends of music. This ability to perceive, interpret, and bring to life the complex patterns and sounds of the glockenspiel is tied strongly to Derrick's arty nature. His love for art encompasses not just visual expression, but aural as well. This allowed him to intuitively understand the technical aspects of the instrument and use them to create emotionally resonant music. His instincts guided his fingers over the keys, telling him where to strike to create the desired note. He was able to grasp the technicalities, such as the importance of mallet selection and striking technique, quite effortlessly. The understanding of tempo, rhythm, and the ability to pour emotion into music, is often an instinctive trait found in those of artistic nature. Derrick's creative instincts guided him to materialize the music in his mind through the keys of the glockenspiel. Moreover, possessing an arty temperament made Derrick open-minded and receptive to exploring new sounds, emotions, and expressions through his music. He displayed a certain kind of flexibility and adaptability in the way he played the instrument. Now, when we look at Adam, he too, is arty but in a different way. However, this trait didn't help him much in learning to play the glockenspiel. There could be many reasons for this. Perhaps Adam's creative forte lies in a different domain of arts or his artistic ability may be of a different kind. Not all art forms are the same, and artistic skills don't necessarily translate across different mediums or instruments. Therefore, while Derrick, with his innate musical instincts and creative disposition, effortlessly learned the glockenspiel, Adam, on the other hand, despite being arty, didn't find it as accessible or instinctive. These cases serve to highlight the diverse range of skills and talents even within those who are artistically inclined."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At the police station, Cash forces the shooter to tell him about a deal scheduled to take place that night.However, the \\"deal\\" is really a plan by Perret to frame Tango and Cash for murder. Tango and Cash separately go to an empty building, preceded by a man who is revealed later in the film to be Requin (Brion James), Perret's lead henchman. After surprising each other, the two detectives find a dead man with audio equipment hidden under his clothing, and a team of FBI agents swarms in. Wyler, the agent in charge, finds Cash's pistol on the floor and arrests both Cash and Tango.At their murder trial, the detectives are incriminated by an audio tape, secretly given to Wyler by Requin and verified in court by an audio expert, which appears to reveal them shooting the FBI agent after discussing a drug purchase.

I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say. He said, “Lady, you're the smartest cop I ever saw, and I hope to God I never see you again.” I think that was the best compliment I ever got. I have other accomplishments.

Grown-ups made special rules called \\"children's rights\\" to help make sure children like you are taken care of and protected. One very important rule is that all children should be protected from any kind of harm or violence. To show that this rule is important, we have some big organizations like the United Nations (UN) that work with different countries to make sure children are safe. They created a special paper called the \\"Convention on the Rights of the Child\\". This paper has a list of many important rules, and one of them says that children should be protected from all kinds of violence. Now, we also have many people who study how children grow and learn, and they agree that living in a safe and loving environment is super important for kids like you. If children feel scared or hurt, it can make it really hard for them to be healthy, happy, and learn new things.

This is a dance competition TV show that has its subsequent concert series and has a large fan base. The user's mention of the tour likely indicates that they enjoy the show and its performances, adding to the positive sentiment. 3. Attending with Friends: The user then mentions \\"Ashleighhh\\" and \\"Izzayyy,\\" presumably referring to friends or acquaintances with whom they will be attending the event. The use of multiple 'h' and 'y' in their names could suggest a more casual, friendly relationship, indicating the user is excited to share this experience with them.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12.

He is of German, Irish, and Norwegian descent. His paternal grandmother, Luise Schalla, was a German immigrant from Osterholz-Scharmbeck, while one of his maternal great-grandfathers, Hans Hovelsen, was a Norwegian immigrant from Fredrikstad. Another set of great-great-grandparents were Thomas Fallon, an Irishman from County Galway, and Louisa Stickever, the daughter of an Irishman born in France and his Irish wife. Fallon married film producer Nancy Juvonen, co-owner of production company Flower Films, on December 22, 2007. After meeting on the set of Fever Pitch, the two began dating in May 2007. Fallon proposed in August 2007 with a Neil Lane-designed engagement ring, at sunset on the dock of Juvonen's family home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. They were married four months later. They have two daughters. They have a female English cream Golden Retriever named Gary Frick that has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On June 26, 2015, Fallon suffered a ring avulsion, an injury he suffered by tripping over a rug in his home and catching his wedding ring on a counter top which nearly tore off his finger. He was taken to the emergency room and then sent to a surgeon who performed microsurgery on his finger. Fallon spent 10 days in the ICU before going home.

It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road that reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi?

Harry, however, is somewhat jealous of the affection his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe) shows Peter. Norman, the head of weapons contractor Oscorp, appreciates Peter's scientific aptitude and can barely conceal his desire that Peter was his own son.Peter's science class takes a field trip to a genetics laboratory at Columbia University. The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of spiders through genetic manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the school newspaper, one of these new spiders lands on his hand and bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the venom injected by the spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter. Meanwhile, General Slocum (Stanley Anderson) visits Oscorp to see the results of their new super soldier formula. When one of Norman's top scientists, Dr. Stromm (Ron Perkins) warns him the formula is unstable, General Slocum threatens to pull all of the military's funding from Oscorp. Later that night, Norman exposes himself to the formula. He gains superhuman strength and agility but is driven insane. He kills Stromm and steals two other Oscorp inventions, an exoskeleton and jet glider.Peter wakes up the next morning feeling better than ever. He also learns his scrawny physique now ripples with muscles and his eyesight is perfect. At school that day, he learns he can shoot webs out of spinnerettes in his wrists.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville contacted Burke in November 1790 because he admired Burke's work, \\"Reflections,\\" and wanted to request more thought-provoking content that he could publish.

Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Question: According to the passage, noise is .

Emily and Rachel may have different perspectives when it comes to dressing up for parties, but their choices represent their unique tastes and personalities. Emily is of the view that parties are special occasions that warrant dressing up in elegant and eye-catching outfits. She thrives on the excitement of selecting the perfect ensemble, from the perfect dress to wonderfully matching accessories. This is not only a form of self-expression for Emily but also a way to boost her confidence and make a lasting impression on others. For her, fashion is an art form, and she truly enjoys being creative and experimenting with various looks, patterns, and styles. On the other hand, Rachel embraces an entirely different approach to dressing up for parties. For her, comfort is the ultimate priority when it comes to selecting clothes and accessories. She loves to wear attire that is casual and allows her to move, dance, or simply chill effortlessly throughout the party. Rachel cherishes these gatherings as opportunities to let loose and enjoy the company of her friends and family, and she feels that wearing comfortable clothes helps her focus on the experience rather than constantly worrying about her appearance. In fact, Rachel has a penchant for picking clothes that are not only comfortable but also stylish in their own right. She believes in simplicity and minimalism, opting for chic but effortless outfits that reflect her laid-back and modest personality. Both Emily and Rachel differ significantly when it comes to their fashion choices for parties. While Emily enthusiastically indulges in the latest fashion trends, exploring various colors, fabrics, and textures, Rachel opts for a more understated approach. She chooses neutral and earth-toned palettes, focusing on simplicity and wearability rather than ostentatious display. In a way, Emily's dressing style can be seen as a form of socializing, as her outfits often spark conversations and compliment from other party guests. She genuinely enjoys discussing fashion and sharing style tips, and her dressing choices open up opportunities for connection and camaraderie. Conversely, Rachel sees parties as a time to let her hair down and catch up with friends, without the added pressure of dressing up and adhering to specific party attire norms. Her comfortable outfits radiate a sense of ease that ultimately translates into her attitudes towards partying and mingling with others, as well. Despite their contrasting outlooks on dressing up for parties, both Emily and Rachel are confident in their clothing choices and respect each other's preferences. They understand that the way they dress is a reflection of their personalities and lifestyles, and it is essential for each of them to be true to themselves. Just like Emily and Rachel, it is important for everyone to recognize that different people have different tastes when it comes to fashion. What truly matters is finding the style that makes you feel content, confident, and, most importantly, comfortable in your own skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Empiricism: Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit. According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist — hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the \\"permanent possibility of sensation\\". Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for all meaningful knowledge including mathematics. As summarized by D.W. Hamlin: What is subjective idealism closely related to?","completion":"Subjective idealism is closely related to phenomenalism. Both of them believe that only mental objects, properties, and events exist. Phenomenalism says that physical things, like objects and events, can be reduced to mental experiences. So, both ideas tell us that our world is made up of our thoughts and feelings, rather than just physical objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Get an ice cube tray - Fill the tray with cool water - Place the tray in the freezer - Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - Take they tray out of the freezer - Pop the ice cubes out of tray. Question: suppose a person needs ice for a barbecue happens, how will it affect Less trays are filled. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less If a person needs ice for a barbecue, the amount of ice produced will directly depend on the number of ice trays filled with water and subsequently frozen. If fewer trays are filled with water, there will be a smaller quantity of ice cubes produced. In this situation, the outcome results in less ice rather than more or no effect. To better understand this, let's break down the process and examine the consequences of filling fewer trays. 1. Get an ice cube tray - This step establishes the need for an ice cube tray and suggests that the more trays used, the more ice that can be produced. 2. Fill the tray with cool water - Depending on the number of trays being filled, the amount of cool water used will vary. More trays filled translates to a greater quantity of cool water used in the process. 3. Place the tray in the freezer - In this step, the trays filled with water are placed in the freezer to solidify into ice cubes. Space availability in the freezer will usually dictate the maximum number of trays that can be placed there simultaneously. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - The trays need to be left undisturbed while the water freezes into ice cubes. This can take a few hours, depending on the tray's material, the freezer temperature, and water temperature. Fewer trays filled with water would mean that the freezer works on a smaller volume of water. This, in turn, could potentially lead to the ice freezing slightly faster; however, this is not a significant factor in the overall ice production quantity. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer - This step involves removing the frozen trays from the freezer. If fewer trays were filled initially, then fewer trays can be taken out, resulting in a lesser quantity of ice. 6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray - Finally, the ice cubes are removed from the trays and made available for use. The overall quantity of ice produced for the barbecue will be less if fewer trays were filled with water beforehand. In conclusion, the answer is B: less. Filling fewer trays will result in producing less ice for a given event, such as a barbecue. If an individual needs more ice for such an occasion, it is essential to consider filling more trays or planning ahead to use additional means to produce the desired quantity of ice."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in the Bulgarian language and corresponding English translation of this sentence.

During the campaign in Egypt, Napoleon showed much tolerance towards religion for a revolutionary general, holding discussions with Muslim scholars and ordering religious celebrations, but General Dupuy, who accompanied Napoleon, revealed, shortly after Pope Pius VI's death, the political reasons for such behaviour: \\"We are fooling Egyptians with our pretended interest for their religion; neither Bonaparte nor we believe in this religion more than we did in Pius the Defunct's one\\".[note 8] In his memoirs, Bonaparte's secretary Bourienne wrote about Napoleon's religious interests in the same vein.

Simplify the equation: Firstly, let's move all variables (l) to one side of the equation, in this case, to the right side. Doing so will involve adding 35*l to both sides of the equation. -35*l + 35*l = -36*l + 35*l On the left side, -35*l and 35*l will cancel each other out, leaving 0: 0 = -36*l + 35*l 3. Combine the terms with the variable (l): -36*l and 35*l share the same variable \\"l\\", so we can combine them: 0 = (-36 + 35)*l This simplifies to: 0 = -1*l 4. Solve for \\"l\\": Now we have a simple equation to solve for the variable \\"l\\". To find \\"l\\", we need to isolate it. Since the coefficient of \\"l\\" is -1, we simply divide both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for \\"l\\". 0 / -1 = (-1*l) / -1 Dividing by -1 results in: 0 = 1*l This can also be expressed simply as: 0 = l So, the solution to the given equation -35*l = -36*l is l=0.

Article: How can you help kids cope with stress? Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions. For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home. Question: Why do some parents feel it difficult to spare quality time for their kids? Answer: Pick your answer from: [a]. Their kids are growing so fast. [b]. They have too much housework. [c].

Background: Sevendust is an American alternative metal band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 1994 by bassist Vince Hornsby, drummer Morgan Rose and guitarist John Connolly. After their first demo, lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and guitarist Clint Lowery joined the group. Following a few name changes, the members settled on the name Sevendust and released their self-titled debut album on April 15, 1997. They have attained success with three consecutive RIAA gold certified albums, a Grammy nomination, and have sold millions of albums worldwide. Context: On August 24, 1999, they released their second album, Home. The album peaked at 19 on the Billboard 200 and featured Skin from Skunk Anansie and Chino Moreno from Deftones as guest vocalists. The two singles from the album, \\"Denial\\" and \\"Waffle\\", gave the band moderate chart success, and the latter of which was played on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien show. They appeared in Woodstock 1999 and have toured with many bands such as Korn, Staind, Nonpoint, Reveille, Godsmack, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Powerman 5000, Creed, Kid Rock, Machine Head, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and Metallica. In 1999, they gained European exposure by opening for Skunk Anansie at various shows in Germany. Skin from Skunk Anansie provided guest vocals on the track Licking Cream off Home. They also opened with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent for Metallica on New Year's Eve in 1999 at the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, Michigan. They also joined Slipknot, Coal Chamber and other bands on the Tattoo the Earth Tour in June 2000. Also in 2000, the song \\"Fall\\" was recorded by producer Sylvia Massy in 1998 at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. \\"Fall\\" appears on the soundtrack to the film Scream 3. In November 2001, the band released their third album, Animosity. This album went gold and gained the band commercial success thanks to the success of singles \\"Praise\\" and \\"Angel's Son\\", which peaked at 15 and 11, respectively, on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. In 2002 they covered the theme song of Chris Jericho for WWF Forceable Entry. The song was never used as an official entry theme for him though. \\"Angel's Son\\" was a tribute to Lynn Strait, the lead singer of the band Snot, whom the members of Sevendust were friends with. Strait had died in a car accident in 1998. In addition to being included on Animosity, the song was included on the compilation album Strait Up. The band made an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman playing an acoustic version of \\"Angel's Son\\" featuring Paul Shaffer on keyboards. In the same year Sevendust was seen in the Chris Rock movie Down to Earth as a partial clip of \\"Waffle\\" is played. Another friend of the band, Dave Williams, the lead singer of Drowning Pool, died in 2002. Tragedy would strike again when Lajon Witherspoon's younger brother was shot and killed later that year. Due to his death, Sevendust went on hiatus in 2002. Question: Did they tour?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Sevendust toured extensively during their career.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Question: In the context of the passage, what was the significance of the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case for state prisoners under sentence of death, and how has the subsequent decision in Baze v. Rees impacted the opportunities for relief through Section 1983? Answer: The 2006 Hill v. McDonough case was significant for state prisoners under sentence of death because it opened up an alternative legal avenue for them to challenge their method of execution. Prior to this case, the Supreme Court had held that habeas corpus was the only legal mechanism available for state prisoners to contest their death sentences. However, in Hill v. McDonough, the Court approved the use of Section 1983 to challenge a state's method of execution on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment as a violation of the Eighth Amendment. This decision was based on the rationale that a prisoner raising such a challenge is not directly attacking their judgment of death, but rather the means by which that judgment will be carried out. As a result, the Supreme Court held that prisoners could use Section 1983 instead of habeas corpus to bring such lawsuits. However, the passage also notes that since the Hill v. McDonough case, there have been limitations on the practical application of Section 1983 for challenging methods of execution. Lower federal courts have frequently refused to hear suits on the grounds that prisoners brought their claims too late and only for purposes of delay. Furthermore, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, which upheld a lethal injection method used by several states, has significantly narrowed the opportunities for relief through Section 1983. In summary, while the Hill v. McDonough case initially provided state prisoners with an alternative means of challenging their execution method under Section 1983, the subsequent ruling in Baze v. Rees and the reluctance of lower federal courts to entertain such suits have considerably limited the potential for relief through this legal avenue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Q: What is the number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction? A: Answer:","completion":"A: The number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction is called a coefficient. In a balanced chemical equation, coefficients are used to ensure that the principle of mass conservation is satisfied, which states that the total mass of substances entering a chemical reaction (reactants) must equal the total mass of substances formed through the reaction (products). This principle is based on the conservation of matter, which suggests that matter can neither be created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction. The use of coefficients helps illustrate the stoichiometry of a chemical reaction, which is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced equation. By showing the ratio of molecules involved in a reaction, coefficients enable chemists to determine the amounts of substances required for the reaction to occur, as well as the amounts produced as a result. Consider the following example of a balanced chemical equation representing the combustion of methane: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O In this equation, we can observe the following coefficients: 1. A \\"1\\" is placed in front of \\"CH₄\\" (methane). The \\"1\\" is generally not written in the equation, but it is implied. This means that there is 1 molecule of methane reacting. 2. A \\"2\\" is placed in front of \\"O₂\\" (oxygen), indicating that 2 molecules of oxygen are reacting. 3. A \\"1\\" is implied in front of \\"CO₂\\" (carbon dioxide), meaning that the reaction produces 1 molecule of carbon dioxide. 4.

Option 1: feelings - This is a general term and doesn't relate specifically to a machine shop or flirting, so it doesn't seem to be the best fit. Option 2: sexual excitement - This term refers to a feeling that may be associated with flirting, but it doesn't relate to a machine shop context. Option 3: sparks fly - This term is used in both the context of flirting and as a metaphor for sexual attraction. Additionally, when one thinks of a machine shop, it involves metalwork and machines, where literal sparks can fly due to the friction between materials. This option seems to be the most relevant. Option 4: problems - This term is too general and doesn't specifically relate to flirting or a machine shop context. Option 5: unwanted pregnancy - This is a potential consequence of engaging in sexual activity, but it doesn't relate directly to flirting or the context of a machine shop.

Additionally, their behavior is described as \\"conspicuously,\\" meaning they are easily noticeable or visible due to their actions when facing predators and human observers. In Sentence 2, the lemmings' coloration is described as \\"conspicuously colored,\\" which suggests that their coloration makes them easily noticeable or visible in their environment.

Answer the following question: Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, and ozone is represented chemically as O3. Given these facts, the depletion of what results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth among the following options: - O3 - O2 - oil - pan - h2o - CO2 - DNA - DDT Answer:","completion":"The depletion of O3, or ozone, results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. Ozone is a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms, represented by the chemical formula O3. This gas is mainly found in the Earth's stratosphere a few miles above the Earth's surface and is crucial for life, as it serves as a protective shield by absorbing and filtering harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation can have adverse effects on the environment and living organisms, including humans. Prolonged exposure to increased levels of UV radiation can lead to skin cancer, cataracts, and immune system suppression in humans. Higher levels of UV radiation can also negatively impact agricultural crops, marine ecosystems, and terrestrial habitats. Ozone depletion is primarily caused by human-produced chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, which were once widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, foam insulation, and firefighting. When these chemicals make their way up into the stratosphere and break down, they release chlorine and bromine atoms, which initiate chemical reactions destroying ozone molecules. This process is accelerated in the cold conditions of the polar regions, leading to the formation of the \\"ozone hole.\\" None of the other options, Oil, O2 (oxygen), Pan, H2O (water), CO2 (carbon dioxide), DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), directly deplete the ozone layer or cause higher levels of UV radiation to reach the Earth. Some of these, like CO2, are related to other environmental issues such as climate change and the greenhouse effect, while others, like DDT, do not contribute to ozone depletion or UV radiation in the same manner. In summary, the depletion of O3 (ozone) is the primary culprit behind higher levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth, among the options provided. Addressing the release of ozone-depleting substances and implementing international agreements, such as the Montreal Protocol, are essential to safeguarding the ozone layer and mitigating the harmful effects of excessive UV radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife.

Given the context: What will happen to Others? a). excited about the kill. b). be proud. c). help him with the kill. Answer:","completion":"In the given context where Austin killed another deer while out hunting with the others, various emotions and reactions can be anticipated from the Others. Here's a detailed breakdown of the potential outcomes: a). Excited about the kill: It is quite likely that the Others would feel excitement upon witnessing the successful hunt since it would indicate a productive outcome from the hunting expedition. This excitement may arise from several factors, such as the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of hunting prowess, or the simple knowledge that the group now has a valuable source of meat to sustain them. b). Be proud: Pride is another potential emotion that the Others may experience upon seeing Austin's successful kill. This pride could stem from the fact that one of their group members has demonstrated skill and expertise in bringing down a deer, which displays a valuable contribution to their collective well-being. Furthermore, the pride could extend to their association with Austin, as they may view themselves as part of a competent and capable hunting party. c). Help him with the kill: After the initial emotions of excitement and pride have subsided, it is expected that the Others would offer their assistance to Austin in dealing with the aftermath of the kill. This could involve several tasks, such as: 1. Field dressing: The Others could help Austin in removing the internal organs of the deer, which is an important step in preserving the meat and ensuring it remains safe for consumption. 2. Transporting the carcass: The group might collectively carry the deer back to their camp or dwelling, where they can process it further and distribute the meat among themselves. 3. Skinning and butchering: Once the deer has been transported to a suitable location, the Others can assist Austin in skinning the animal, separating the meat from the bones, and portioning it out for storage or cooking. 4. Sharing the spoils: As part of a hunting group, the Others would likely participate in the consumption and enjoyment of the deer meat together. This shared experience can reinforce bonds within the group, as well as offering a sense of communal reward for their collective efforts. In conclusion, given the context that Austin killed another deer while out hunting with the Others, it is expected that the group would feel a mixture of excitement and pride, and would subsequently assist Austin in handling and processing the kill. Moreover, this shared experience would likely contribute to a greater sense of unity and camaraderie within the group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered.

Movie title: Family Plot Context: A fake psychic, Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris), and her boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), attempt to locate the nephew of a wealthy and guilt-ridden elderly woman, Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt). Julia's deceased sister gave the baby boy up for adoption, but Julia now wants to make him her heir, and will pay Blanche 10,000 if the man, Edward Shoebridge, can be found. George Lumley discovers that Shoebridge is thought to be dead, but he tracks down another criminal, Joseph Maloney (Ed Lauter), who paid for the tombstone over an empty grave. Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents, faked his own death and is now a successful jeweler in San Francisco known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane). He and his live-in girlfriend, Fran (Karen Black), kidnap millionaires and dignitaries, returning them in exchange for ransoms in the form of valuable gemstones. Arthur conceals an enormous diamond in plain sight in their crystal chandelier. Arthur enlists Maloney, who had helped murder his adoptive parents, to kill Blanche and George. Maloney initially refuses to help, but then contacts Blanche and George, telling them to meet him at a cafÃ© atop a mountain. He cuts the brake line of Blanche's car, but the couple manage to survive a dangerous high-speed descent. Maloney then tries to run them over, but dies in a fiery explosion when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car and tumbles down the mountain. At Maloney's funeral, his mother (Katherine Helmond) tearfully confesses to George that Shoebridge's name is now Arthur Adamson. George has to go to work, so Blanche tracks down various A. Adamsons in San Francisco, eventually reaching the jewelry store as it closes for the day. Arthur's assistant Mrs. Clay (Edith Atwater) offers to let Blanche leave a note, but Blanche says she is Arthur's friend and asks for his address.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow will respond to a new set of U.S. sanctions by expanding its “black list” of Americans, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday, according to RIA news agency. The U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on 19 Russian citizens and five entities on Thursday in the most significant steps the United States has taken against Russia since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. “From the very beginning, we use the principle of parity on the number of people included in sanction lists. So we will expand our ‘black list’ with another group of Americans,” Ryabkov was cited as saying. He added that Moscow did not rule out extra measures in response to new sanctions for alleged interfering in U.S. elections and cyber attacks, which Russia denies. Moscow still wants to maintain a dialogue with Washington and takes counter-measures due to “American political stubbornness”, RIA cited the diplomat as saying. “Those (American) politicians are playing with fire by destroying Russian-American relationship because simultaneously they shake global stability,” Ryabkov said, according to RIA.

Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A characteristic feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that do both feet leave the ground when running? OPT: A). no B). yes The answer is:","completion":"B). yes When running, both feet leave the ground at the same time, which makes it different from walking. When you walk, one foot is always touching the ground. But in running, there is a moment, called the aerial phase, when no feet are touching the ground, and you're sort of like flying for a little bit. This makes you go faster than just walking. So, the answer is yes, both feet leave the ground when running."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these mean the same?

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of Tchaikovsky's former teacher? As The Five's campaign against Rubinstein continued in the press, Tchaikovsky found himself almost as much a target as his former teacher. Cui reviewed the performance of Tchaikovsky's graduation cantata and lambasted the composer as \\"utterly feeble.... If he had any talent at all ... it would surely at some point in the piece have broken free of the chains imposed by the Conservatory.\\" The review's effect on the sensitive composer was devastating. Eventually, an uneasy truce developed as Tchaikovsky became friendly with Balakirev and eventually with the other four composers of the group. A working relationship between Balakirev and Tchaikovsky resulted in Romeo and Juliet. The Five's approval of this work was further followed by their enthusiasm for Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony. Subtitled the Little Russian (Little Russia was the term at that time for what is now called the Ukraine) for its use of Ukrainian folk songs, the symphony in its initial version also used several compositional devices similar to those used by the Five in their work. Stasov suggested the subject of Shakespeare's The Tempest to Tchaikovsky, who wrote a tone poem based on this subject. After a lapse of several years, Balakirev reentered Tchaikovsky's creative life; the result was Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony, composed to a program after Lord Byron originally written by Stasov and supplied by Balakirev. Overall, however, Tchaikovsky continued down an independent creative path, traveling a middle course between those of his nationalistic peers and the traditionalists.

To ensure that vacationers have an exceptional experience and to meet the diverse needs of different tourists, private investors have decided to collaborate with the local authorities of Samokov to develop and construct new ski slopes and a lift. This partnership aims to create new opportunities for both tourists and businesses within the area, benefiting all stakeholders involved. The private investors and local authorities will likely conduct a thorough analysis of the current tourism infrastructure in Samokov to identify areas that require improvement, focusing on the ski slopes and access to them. This may involve examining existing ski resorts, accommodation options, activity offerings, and transportation services. By identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the existing infrastructure, a comprehensive development plan can be created, which will include the construction of new ski slopes and a well-integrated lift system. One potential approach to constructing the new ski slopes is to engage with professional ski resort developers who have extensive knowledge of designing and building ski facilities that appeal to tourists' diverse preferences. This may include creating slopes suitable for beginners, intermediate, and advanced skiers and snowboarders. Ensuring that the slopes cater to a wide range of skill levels will maximize the potential for a successful resort, attracting more tourists to the area. In addition to designing and constructing the slopes, the investors and local authorities may also need to consider the environmental impact of such a development. This would involve conducting environmental assessments to ensure that any new infrastructure is sustainable and does not negatively impact the surrounding natural environment. This is particularly relevant considering the increasing focus on eco-tourism and the need for sustainable tourism practices across the industry. The lift system, which is an integral part of any successful ski resort, will require careful planning and development as well. The investors and local authorities must consider factors such as the layout of the ski slopes, potential visitor capacity, and the overall efficiency of the system when designing and constructing the lift. Additionally, accessibility for disabled individuals and family-friendly design should not be overlooked when developing this key infrastructure. Overall, through their collaboration with the local authorities of Samokov, private investors aim to create a comprehensive development plan that incorporates new ski slopes and a lift, catering to various skill levels and contributing to the growth of the local tourism industry.

Here are possible answers to this question: - working ground - quarry - desert - work area - under ground I believe the correct choice is \\"work area\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Work area An excavation site is a location where archaeologists, geologists, or construction workers dig into the ground to uncover artifacts, fossils, minerals, or to prepare the area for construction. Let us examine each of the given options and justify why \\"work area\\" is the appropriate choice: 1. Working ground: This is a term used to describe an area where work is being done. While an excavation site is a type of working ground, this term is not specific enough to describe the particular characteristics of an excavation site. 2. Quarry: A quarry is a place where stone, sand, or minerals are extracted from the ground. While excavation can occur in a quarry, not all excavation sites are quarries. Quarries focus on extracting specific materials, while excavation sites may have varied objectives. 3. Desert: A desert is a large, dry area with little or no precipitation and limited vegetation. Excavation sites can be found in deserts, but the term \\"desert\\" does not describe the nature of an excavation site. 4. Work area: This term best describes an excavation site as it highlights the purpose of the location – to conduct work. The work conducted at excavation sites, like digging into the ground and analyzing uncovered materials, is unique and distinct from other types of work areas. 5. Underground: An underground location is a subsurface area, such as a cave or a mine. While excavation sometimes involves digging underground, not all excavation sites are located underground. Thus, the correct choice is \\"work area\\" as it accurately describes the purpose and activities conducted at an excavation site, without being too vague or specific to other, unrelated types of locations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

His call comes after Justice Ginsburg, 83, moved beyond her usual candour to disparage Mr Trump in a series of interviews. Critics say the liberal judge has risked her legacy to lambast Mr Trump. \\"He is a faker,\\" Justice Ginsburg told CNN on Monday. \\"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.\\" In a recent New York Times interview, Justice Ginsburg also said a Trump presidency would be unimaginable. \\"I can't imagine what this place would be - I can't imagine what the country would be - with Donald Trump as our president,\\" she said. \\"For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be - I don't even want to contemplate that.\\" Justice Ginsburg also quipped that she would move to New Zealand if he should win the White House. On Tuesday, Mr Trump fired back, telling the New York Times it was \\"highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly\\". The likely Republican nominee said her remarks were a \\"disgrace to the court\\" and insisted she should apologise. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan also weighed in, saying the Justice's remarks revealed \\"bias\\" during a CNN town hall interview on Wednesday. \\"For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon what the next president and Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm\\", he said. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest brushed off the idea that the comments were inappropriate and said \\"she didn't earn the nickname 'The Notorious RBG' for nothing\\". Justice Ginsburg also recently told the Associated Press that \\"it's likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make\\". She is the oldest justice on the court and will be one of three judges over the age of 78 on Election Day. Justice Anthony Kennedy will turn 80 in July and Justice Stephen Breyer will turn 78 in August. The court has taken a central role in the US presidential election over the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.

The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery. Yes, said Richard Brilla, director of the new facility, \\"but the donuts are a lot more costly here.\\" Each wafer, holding hundreds of chips, is worth 6,000 to 10,000 apiece, depending on what insulation, circuitry and materials are used.

The wafers that are not touched by human hands are 300 millimeters big. Imagine them being almost the same size as a standard pizza."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. Paragraph: Two geology students had an exam on plate tectonics. Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Answer:","completion":"Bobby knew more about seafloor spreading, as he learned more about divergent tectonic plates. Seafloor spreading occurs at divergent plate boundaries, where oceanic plates diverge and create new oceanic crust through volcanic activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: While the elements of the routine stay the same (eat, play, sleep, in that order), the length of the elements and the strategies you might use will vary as your child becomes more aware, interactive, and alert during the day and more conscious of your absence at night. At 6 months old, most babies should not need a nighttime feeding, especially if he/she is eating solid food during the day. When your baby begins to sleep through the night, you can stretch the period of activity to 2 to 2.5 hours of playtime between naps. There will also be times when you may need to be flexible with the schedule, such as vacations or when you need to run errands that take longer than 2 hours. During nap or bedtime, babies of this age often \\"talk\\" to themselves or babble, or cry out of tiredness to help themselves fall asleep. It's important that you don't rush to her before she has had a chance to settle in for sleep. Listen to the sound of the cry. The most common signal that she wants to be comforted is your child holding out her hands to you. When you pick her up, hold her in a horizontal position and say soothing words before placing her back in the crib. If she gets more upset, walk away from her crib and avoid eye contact. You may be a distraction. At this age, your baby has become more aware of your absence and may benefit from an item that can help comfort and sooth her to sleep, such as a small, soft blanket or favorite sleep-safe toy. If possible, try to use the same object at every nap and bedtime, and try to keep the toy or blanket in the bed only. This way, the baby will learn to associate the transitional item with sleep and not with playtime, and will be more likely to use it to sooth herself to sleep rather than playing in the bed. Summary:","completion":"As your baby grows, the routine elements of eating, playing, and sleeping remain the same, but their duration and strategies may change. By six months, babies usually don't need nighttime feeding and can have 2-2.5 hours of playtime between naps. Be flexible with the schedule during vacations or long errands. Babies may babble or cry during bedtime, but listen for signals they need comforting before intervening. If needed, provide a consistent sleep-safe object to comfort and soothe them during sleep, helping with the separation process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As he explores the mystical world, Danny unlocks transformational powers that aid him in overcoming various obstacles in both the real and magical worlds, leading him to solve a mystery that threatens to upend both worlds. Act One: The movie begins by introducing Danny Winters as he joins a new school after his family moves to the quaint town of Greenfield. While Danny struggles to make friends and settle in his new environment, he finds solace in the digital diary on his phone, where he frequently documents his thoughts and wishes. One day, while wandering in the woods behind his house, Danny unknowingly stumbles upon an ancient magical portal that transports him to the hidden world of Wayward – a place that exists parallel to the human world. There, Danny befriends an array of colorful and otherworldly characters like Zephyr, a shape-shifting faerie; Leo, a courageous talking fox; and Luna, the ethereal guardian of the portal. Act Two: As Danny becomes more engrossed in Wayward's enchanting atmosphere, he learns that the magical world is protected by the mysterious Council of Wayward, an ancient group made up of elders from each magical species. Danny's curiosity leads him to Luna, the guardian of the portal, who reveals that a dangerous villain, Mortimer Blackwood, plans to exploit Wayward's supernatural powers to create chaos and destruction in the human world. Luna informs Danny that his unique connection to both worlds and his pure heart qualify him to become the prophesized hero, destined to protect and restore the balance between the two realms. As Danny embarks on a journey to develop his newfound powers and fulfill his destiny, a growing bond and camaraderie develop among his newfound friends. With their help, Danny learns to manipulate the elements and harness the transformative power of his emotions to overcome obstacles and confront Blackwood's minions. Act Three: As Danny's powers continue to develop, so does his connection to the magical creatures and the people of Greenfield. Unbeknownst to Danny, his powers also make him visible to Mortimer Blackwood, who orchestrates a series of calamities in the human world, shifting the blame onto Danny and his magical companions. This causes a rift between the inhabitants of Greenfield and Wayward, weakening the connection between the two worlds. As Danny and his friends race against time to gather the final artifacts required to stop Blackwood's plan, they discover that Danny's digital diary has recorded their adventures and Blackwood's schemes. Using the diary's evidence, Danny manages to unite the people of both worlds against the nefarious villain. In an epic climax, Danny confronts Mortimer Blackwood in a thrilling showdown. Danny combines the power of the artifacts with his own transformative abilities, ultimately defeating the villain and restoring harmony to both worlds. As the movie ends, Danny, Zephyr, Leo, and Luna are hailed as heroes in both the human and magical realms.

Carson wants to protect himself from this noise, but he also needs to be able to hear the orders given to him by his boss on the site. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would electronic ear protectors be appropriate for Carson, yes or no? Hint: Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds.","completion":"Yes, electronic ear protectors would be appropriate for Carson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

AVenture’s Mr Sysoyev told Mr Satell, as a result of such startups, he expects Ukraine's tech industry to soon be worth about 5 billion (£3.1 billion). He added that that ‘homegrown software firms’ that design, build and market products internationally are the sector most likely to disrupt the US dominance. 'If Sysoyev is right about the possibility of Ukrainian tech companies achieving major valuations in the near future, then Ukraine really does have a chance to break out and become a true technology hub,' explained Mr Satell. 'Even one billion dollar Ukrainian company could attract enough capital to catalyse the entire tech sector.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Ukraine has a thriving startup industry despite ongoing political conflicts in the region. With 19 Ukrainian startups recently receiving top honours at an investor conference and venture capital firms heavily investing in the region, Ukraine has strong potential to become a major player in the tech industry.

With an estimated value of 5 billion for Ukraine's tech industry in the near future, homegrown software firms designing, building, and marketing products globally could pose a significant challenge to US tech dominance. The emergence of a billion-dollar Ukrainian company could potentially catalyse the entire tech sector in the region, creating a true technology hub rivaling giants like Silicon Valley."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Steer clear of hot peppers, ginger, garlic, chili, paprika and other spices that raise your body's temperature. Eat bland foods for the weeks leading up to your period. Some women claim that this can help postpone your period because your body temperature isn't being elevated by the food, but there is no medical research to back this up. A traditional home remedy, it's not clear why it might work — but many women say that it does. You should eat it on an empty stomach, at least once a day for a week prior to when your cycle would normally begin. Boil a bunch of parsley in 16 oz of water for 20 minutes. Strain the liquid and add honey. Consume it two to three times per day, 15 days before your period is set to begin. Add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to an 8-oz glass of water. Start drinking three times a day at least three days before your period is set to begin. Again, remember that none of these remedies are backed up with scientific evidence. When you are habitually exercising, your levels of progesterone, a hormone known to inhibit menstrual bleeding, are elevated. Do strenuous activities like running, swimming, weight-lifting, or aerobics. If you are already engaged in some form of exercise, increase the intensity. If you are physically inactive, try a progressive exercise program to safely ease yourself into an exercise routine. This is not a suggestion to seek out more stress in your life — it is an observation that often one traumatic event will postpone or even prevent a normal menstrual cycle. Mental and emotional stress tend to put our bodies on alert, and your body will deal with the stress rather than creating your normal menstrual period. Summary:","completion":"Avoid spicy foods and try home remedies such as consuming parsley, apple cider vinegar, and exercising regularly to possibly postpone your period, although there is no scientific evidence to support these methods. Be aware that mental and emotional stress can also impact your menstrual cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Almost every time I come to Vegas I stay here because its perfect for what I'm looking for in my Vegas adventure. I come here to get outside and enjoy myself or go gambling until 9am without having to sell a kidney and I get all of that here. Now let me also say, I'm a bit boogie when it comes to my hotel preferences so I'm not all about cost. I have realistic standards and understand the concept of \\"you get what you pay for\\" but I have NEVER gone wrong with LVH. I'm not a big gambler so I love being here where the tables are hot but not incredibly expensive to join. There are a lot of options on the machines which is great for me because I love the penny machines, lol. Its right off the strip and not on a street that is too hectic or in the hub of all the traffic, I don't care for any of that. I had bad customer service at the check in counter once but I attribute that to the lady who had a bad attitude and not the overall service at the hotel. When I requested toothpaste they had it to me very quickly which lets be honest, is kind of a big deal because no one goes out of their room with a hot mouth (let's hope not!) The room itself was very comfortable and didn't make me feel cheap. Now I understand this place isn't flashy like other hotels but I don't spend most of my time in my room, that's not why you come to Vegas! But when I am done with my daily adventure or need to rejuvenate I want to feel that I'm lying on clean sheets, the room is comfortable and I can relax. Each and every time it I was completely satisfied. Soooooo, try it out! It's very inexpensive and there are all kinds of ways to get deals on this place. Hotwire, Hotels.com, sign up on their email list and immediately get 30% off, sign up on their mobile line and get another deal. I've even seen offers on Hotel Tonight.

What are some good hardware oriented projects to do in the final year of engineering for IT students? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: (i). no; (ii). yes;","completion":"(i). No. The first question addresses the best type of United States Clinical Experience (USCE) for an international undergraduate medical student in the USA who is not in their final year, while the second question deals with suitable hardware-oriented projects for final year Information Technology (IT) engineering students. These questions are inquiring about the different information as they pertain to separate fields of study and distinct situations. I will now address each question individually. 1. Best type of USCE for international undergraduate medical students (not in their final year): United States Clinical Experience (USCE) usually entails gaining hands-on clinical experience in the US healthcare system. For international undergraduate (not in their final year) medical students, obtaining USCE is crucial for becoming a competitive candidate when applying for residency programs in the USA. The ideal USCE for an undergraduate medical student who has not yet entered their final year would include: a. Elective clerkships: Participate in elective rotations at US medical schools or affiliated hospitals, which provides an opportunity to get hands-on experience in your chosen specialty. These clerkships may also offer letter of recommendations (LORs) that can be beneficial when applying to residency programs. b. Research experience: If possible, engage in research projects related to your area of interest in a US medical school, hospital, or research institution. This experience can enhance your CV and provide valuable networking opportunities. c. Observerships or externships: These hands-on experiences allow medical students to shadow physicians in hospitals or clinics to understand patient care and gain insight into the US medical culture. While these do not often allow direct patient contact, they still provide students with the opportunity to familiarize themselves with different specialties and healthcare environments. 2. Good hardware-oriented final year projects for IT engineering students: For Information Technology students with an interest in hardware, here are some project ideas to consider for your final year: a. Raspberry Pi or Arduino-based projects: Utilize devices like Raspberry Pi or Arduino to create innovative systems like home automation, surveillance, or smart gardening solutions. b. IoT (Internet of Things) projects: Develop IoT-based systems that can collect, transmit, and process data from various devices and sensors. Typical applications include smart cities, wearable health monitoring devices, or intelligent transportation systems. c. Robotics and automation projects: Explore the world of robotics by developing robots capable of performing various tasks or interacting with their environment. Examples include drones, robotic arms, or autonomous vehicles. d. Embedded systems development: Design and develop an embedded system for a specific application, such as energy management, healthcare monitoring, or navigation. e. Hardware design and simulation: Use tools like VHDL or Verilog to design custom digital circuits or processors. Simulate and test your designs with hardware description languages and FPGA boards. Whichever project you choose, make sure to focus on creating innovative solutions while also demonstrating your understanding of hardware concepts and engineering principles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mortal Kombat Context: The film is centered on Mortal Kombat, a fighting tournament between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the Elder Gods amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is Sub-Zero, whose defense seems untouched because of his freezing abilities, until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero. Prince Goro enters the tournament and mercilessly crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Sonya worries that they may not win against Goro, but Raiden disagrees. He reveals their own fears and egos are preventing them from winning the tournament. Despite Sonya's warning, Cage comes to Tsung to request a fight with Goro. The sorcerer...

Premise: \\"what do you all have aspen you all have mostly aspen or\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Some of you have aspen and some of you have something else.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"what do you all have aspen you all have mostly aspen or,\\" we can work to understand its context, grammar, and intended meaning to evaluate the hypothesis \\"Some of you have aspen and some of you have something else.\\" First, let's analyze the given premise, according to its individual components: 1. \\"what do you all have aspen you all have\\" 2. \\"mostly aspen\\" 3. \\"or\\" It appears that the original premise could be interpreted as follows: \\"What do you all have? Aspen? You all have mostly Aspen or...?\\" In this case, the speaker is asking about the composition of a group, their possession or characteristics related to Aspen trees. The question seems to be asking if: (1) the entire group has Aspen, (2) the group has mostly Aspen, or (3) there are other alternatives. Now let's examine the hypothesis: \\"Some of you have aspen and some of you have something else.\\" This statement suggests that the group being referred to has a mix of individuals with Aspen and individuals without Aspen (who possess or are characterized by something else). Considering the interpretations of the premise and the hypothesis, we can tentatively agree that the hypothesis could be true. If the speaker is inquiring about the composition of the group and allows for additional alternatives other than \\"mostly aspen,\\" then it is possible that the group could indeed be composed of some individuals with Aspen and others without Aspen. However, it is important to note that the premise carries a degree of ambiguity, making it difficult to ascertain its exact meaning. Consequently, our conclusion about the hypothesis is subject to the interpretations made on the premise. Additionally, the premise itself does not provide factual information about the group's composition; it is merely a question. Therefore, the truth of the hypothesis cannot be definitively established based on the premise alone. More context or information would be needed to validate or refute the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

Question: Which election year does the passage mention leading to Rahmon's second term in office? Context: The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.

Write an article based on this \\"Do not let the half-halt last longer than one stride. Do not overdo the reins. Do not wait too long for the half-halt. Communicate clearly to the horse with your aids.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Half-Halt: A Key Skill for Effective Communication with Your Horse Introduction Equestrian communication is a critical aspect of horsemanship, and among various techniques, the half-halt stands out as an essential tool for riders of all levels. A well-executed half-halt helps to maintain balance, regulate pace, and prepare the horse for upcoming movements. Mastering the half-halt promotes a harmonious relationship between rider and horse, ensuring a more enjoyable experience for both. In this article, we will discuss the importance of not letting the half-halt last longer than one stride, avoiding overusing the reins, timely execution, and effectively using your aids to communicate with your horse. 1. Keep the half-halt short and concise The half-halt should be a brief correction, lasting no more than one stride. By keeping the half-halt short, you ensure that your horse remains responsive and attentive without becoming confused or overwhelmed. A prolonged half-halt hinders the horse's forward movement and disrupts its rhythm, leading to a loss of momentum and balance. By executing a quick and concise half-halt, you send a clear signal to your horse that enables better communication and improved performance. 2. Be mindful of rein usage Reins serve as a vital communication tool for horse and rider, but it is essential to avoid relying on them excessively during the execution of a half-halt. Overuse of the reins can lead to a dull or unresponsive horse that is less likely to understand your cues. Instead, focus on utilizing your seat, legs, and body weight to transmit your message effectively, using the reins only when necessary as a supporting aid. Striking a balance between rein usage and other aids ensures clearer communication and a more responsive horse. 3. Do not wait too long to initiate the half-halt Timing is crucial when executing a half-halt. It is essential to give the cue promptly, as waiting too long may cause the horse to lose balance or rhythm and make it challenging to execute the desired movement. Developing a keen sense of timing is a skill that improves with practice and experience. By understanding your horse's natural rhythm and being mindful of the appropriate moment to apply a half-halt, you will enhance your horse's responsiveness and overall performance. 4. Communicate clearly using your aids To be successful in executing a half-halt, it is crucial to communicate effectively with your horse using your aids. Practicing clear communication will help your horse understand your intentions and give you better control during your rides. Ensure consistent contact with your horse through your seat, legs, and hands. Maintain a steady connection and engage your core muscles, while also being conscious of your position and posture. These efforts will make it easier for your horse to comprehend your cues and respond accordingly. Conclusion Incorporating mindful execution, precise timing, and effective use of aids in your half-halts significantly enhances communication with your horse, leading to improved performance and a stronger bond between horse and rider. As you continue to practice and refine your half-halts, you will find this essential skill invaluable in successfully navigating your equestrian journey. Remember, it takes time, commitment, and patience to develop this crucial skill, but the reward is a harmonious partnership that lasts a lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.

Process: - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less mycelium and buds happens, how will it affect MORE erosion by the ocean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves less mycelium and buds. Mycelium refers to the vegetative part of a fungus, while buds typically refer to young shoots or undeveloped flowers in plants. Neither of these elements has a significant direct influence on the process of ocean erosion on rocks and beaches. Ocean erosion primarily results from the force of waves, tides, currents, and wind. However, it's worth considering the indirect effects of the perturbation. Less mycelium could potentially result in reduced fungal activity and decomposition of organic matter in the soil. Likewise, fewer buds imply that there might be less vegetation growth in the area. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased plant root structure and overall plant cover, which could in turn weaken the soil structure and stability in beach or coastal areas. When the soil structure is weakened, and there's less vegetation to help keep it together, it might exacerbate the erosion process caused by ocean waves, winds, and currents. In this case, the beach or coastal area may experience more rapid erosion, making the landscape more vulnerable to the ocean's forces. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis involving less mycelium and buds doesn't have a direct effect on ocean erosion, it could potentially have indirect effects on the process by influencing soil structure and stability.

Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 - June 8, 1845) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the seventh president of the United States from 1829 to 1837. Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of Congress. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the \\"common man\\" against a \\"corrupt aristocracy\\" and to preserve the Union. Born in the colonial Carolinas to a Scotch-Irish family in the decade before the American Revolutionary War, Jackson became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region of the Carolinas. His parents were Scots-Irish colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, Presbyterians who had emigrated from present day Northern Ireland two years earlier. Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738. Jackson's parents lived in the village of Boneybefore, also in County Antrim. His paternal family line originated in Killingswold Grove, Yorkshire, England. When they immigrated to North America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Philadelphia. Most likely they traveled overland through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the Waxhaws, straddling the border between North and South Carolina. They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764). Jackson's father died in a logging accident while clearing land in February 1767 at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born. Jackson, his mother, and his brothers lived with Jackson's aunt and uncle in the Waxhaws region, and Jackson received schooling from two nearby priests. Jackson's exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mother's actions immediately following her husband's funeral. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed. In 1824 Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born on the plantation of his uncle James Crawford in Lancaster County, South Carolina. Jackson may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina. In 1794, Jackson formed a partnership with fellow lawyer John Overton, dealing in claims for land reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw. Like many of their contemporaries, they dealt in such claims although the land was in Indian country. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened Indian lands west of the Appalachians within North Carolina to claim by that state's residents. He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis, Tennessee, in 1819. After moving to Nashville, Jackson became a protege of William Blount, a friend of the Donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the territory. Jackson became attorney general in 1791, and he won election as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected its only U.S. Representative. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, the dominant party in Tennessee. Jackson soon became associated with the more radical, pro-French and anti-British wing. He strongly opposed the Jay Treaty and criticized George Washington for allegedly removing Republicans from public office. Jackson joined several other Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington, a vote that would later haunt him when he sought the presidency. In 1797, the state legislature elected him as U.S. Senator. Jackson seldom participated in debate and found the job dissatisfying. He pronounced himself \\"disgusted with the administration\\" of President John Adams and resigned the following year without explanation. Upon returning home, with strong support from western Tennessee, he was elected to serve as a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court at an annual salary of 600. Jackson's service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making. Jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804. His official reason for resigning was ill health. He had been suffering financially from poor land ventures, and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-time to his business interests. After arriving in Tennessee, Jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the Tennessee militia. In 1802, while serving on the Tennessee Supreme Court, he declared his candidacy for major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position voted on by the officers. At that time, most free men were members of the militia. The organizations, intended to be called up in case of conflict with Europeans or Indians, resembled large social clubs. Jackson saw it as a way to advance his stature. With strong support from western Tennessee, he tied with John Sevier with seventeen votes. Sevier was a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, the recognized leader of politics in eastern Tennessee. On February 5, Governor Archibald Roane broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson had also presented Roane with evidence of land fraud against Sevier. Subsequently, in 1803, when Sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship, Roane released the evidence. Sevier insulted Jackson in public, and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter. Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane, and continued to serve as governor until 1809. After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814, Jackson instituted martial law in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary. These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral Alexander Cochrane and later General Edward Pakenham, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars. Jackson only had about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained. The British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the morning of December 23. That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back. On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster. For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured. After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the \\"Second American Revolution\\" against the British. By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal. Alexis de Tocqueville (\\"underwhelmed\\" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in Democracy in America that Jackson \\"was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.\\" Did they win the battle","completion":"Yes, Andrew Jackson and his troops won the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson's forces successfully defended the city against the British attack on January 8, 1815. The victory made Jackson a national hero, and it was a significant moment for the United States as it marked the end of the War of 1812 against the British."},{"prompt":"Question: Process: - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body.

Burges played an important role in the renaissance of High Victorian stained glass. The provision of glass of appropriate colour and richness was central to many of his decorative themes, and he invested effort in working with the best cartoonists and manufacturers to achieve this. He also studied the history of glass production, writing in his second Art Applied to Industry lecture, \\"[a] use of antiquarian studies is to restore disused arts, and to get all the good we can out of them for our own improvement.\\" In the catalogue to the exhibition of stained glass cartoons from Cardiff Castle, Sargent pays tribute to \\"his deep knowledge of the history and techniques of glass manufacture\\" and Lawrence considers him a pioneer who, by his \\"painstaking studies, re-established the principles of medieval decoration and used this to make [his] own bold and original statements.\\" The results were outstanding; Lawrence wrote that Burges designed with \\"a vibrancy, an intensity and a brilliance which no other glass maker could match.\\" He acknowledges Burges's debt to the manufacturers and craftsmen with whom he worked, in particular, Gualbert Saunders, whose \\"technique [gave] Burges's glass its most distinctive characteristic, namely the flesh colour. This is unique, had no precedents and has had no imitators.\\" As well as at Saint Fin Barre's, Burges designed stained glass for all of his own significant churches, for reconstructions of medieval churches undertaken by others, and for his secular buildings.

U.S., in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison, seeking a legal definition for the word religion. Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that \\"Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.\\" Considering this, the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional. What was the topic of Reynolds v. U.S.?","completion":"Reynolds v. U.S. was a landmark Supreme Court case that took place in 1878, addressing the topic of polygamy and the extent to which religious freedom is protected under the Constitution. The issue at hand was whether the federal government had the authority to outlaw polygamy, even when practiced as a part of an individual's religious beliefs. The case involved George Reynolds, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church. Reynolds was charged with bigamy, the act of marrying one person while still being legally married to another, which was a violation of the federal Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862. He defended his actions by arguing that his religious beliefs required him to practice polygamy, and thus the federal law infringed on his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion. In its decision, the Supreme Court sought to establish a clear distinction between the protection of religious beliefs and the regulation of actions resulting from those beliefs. As you mentioned, the court cited Thomas Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists and James Madison's writings to argue that the First Amendment was intended to safeguard individual's religious opinions, but not necessarily their actions based on those opinions. Justice Stephen Johnson Field, writing for the majority, found that the government was allowed to take action against behaviors that it deemed to be \\"in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.\\" The Court held that while religious beliefs were protected, the actions that stemmed from them, such as the practice of polygamy, could be restricted by the government if they were found to be a threat to the welfare of society. Consequently, the Supreme Court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional, upholding Reynolds' conviction, and setting a precedent for the government's ability to regulate certain actions, even when they are grounded in religious beliefs. This decision has continued to shape the discourse surrounding religious freedom and the limitations of governmental power in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement suggests the opposite – that the town appears more visually pleasing or charming when observed from a distance. Camara de Lobos is a beautiful town on the southern coast of Madeira, Portugal, with a stunning natural bay and a rich history. It has a picturesque appearance from afar due to several factors, such as its colorful buildings, the dramatic cliffs and the green mountain backdrop, the reflection of the town on the calm waters of the bay, and the overall harmony of nature and humanity living side by side. However, when viewed up close, some aspects of the town might not be as appealing as they appear from a distance. One might encounter worn-out building exteriors, narrow streets, and perhaps some untidy areas. Despite these imperfections, the local culture, vibrant fishing community, and history still have a unique charm that draws tourists. In conclusion, since the statement posits that \\"Camara de Lobos is more picturesque from afar than it is up close,\\" we cannot then conclude that it is more picturesque up close than from a distance. Instead, the observation suggests that while the town's overall beauty and charm are evident, details that may not be as visually pleasing become apparent upon closer inspection. However, appreciating Camara de Lobos's charm might involve embracing not only the observable beauty from afar but also the authenticity and cultural richness up close."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information about both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf step by step: Step 1: Identify who Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf are. Pauline Kael was an American film critic who wrote for The New Yorker magazine from 1968 to 1991. She was known for her in-depth and witty reviews of films. Christa Wolf was a German literary critic, novelist, and essayist who focused on contemporary issues and the difficulties of East Germans in adapting to their new surroundings after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Step 2: Determine if they were critics of artistic works. Pauline Kael was a film critic, which means she critiqued artistic works, specifically films. This makes her a critic of artistic works. Christa Wolf was primarily a novelist and essayist, but she also engaged in literary criticism, which is the evaluation and interpretation of literary works. This makes her a critic of artistic works as well, although her focus was more on literature. Step 3: Combine the facts and create the answer. Based on our analysis, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf were critics of artistic works, although their areas of focus were different, with Kael specializing in film and Wolf in literature. Thus, the answer to the question is: Yes, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf were critics of artistic works."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They spent time discussing actors Jason Statham and Sylvester Stallone, who are both well-known for their roles in many action movies. Indeed, Fisher mentions that they would watch any movie with these actors, regardless of the film’s ratings or reviews—a clear indicator of their strong preference for these actors. Their conversation revolves around movies in which either Jason Statham or Sylvester Stallone has acted. First, Zuri asked Fisher if they have seen the Transporter and the Expendables. The Transporter is a popular action movie series starring Jason Statham, while the Expendables is an ensemble action film series featuring Sylvester Stallone among other high-profile action stars. Fisher confirmed that they have watched these movies several times to the point of losing count. This not only re-emphasizes their affection for the actors but also their preference for action movies. Next, they discuss the possibility of watching High Voltage. Although the specific movie is not clear from the context, it's likely they are referring to \\"Crank: High Voltage\\", an action movie featuring Jason Statham. The latter part of the conversation transitions from discussing movie preferences to making real-life arrangements. Fisher invites Zuri to come to their place, implying to watch High Voltage—a movie Zuri expressed interest in but has not yet seen. Zuri accepts the invitation, affirming that they will come alone as Fisher specified. Therefore, in summary, their conversation is about their mutual interest in films made by particular actors and the plan of watching one of them at Fisher's place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Vantage Point Context: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

News article: A map of the world's countries by most and least emotional. Click to enlarge. (Max Fisher) Since 2009, the Gallup polling firm has surveyed people in 150 countries and territories on, among other things, their daily emotional experience. Their survey asks five questions, meant to gauge whether the respondent felt significant positive or negative emotions the day prior to the survey. The more times that people answer \\"yes\\" to questions such as \\"Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?\\", the more emotional they're deemed to be. Gallup has tallied up the average \\"yes\\" responses from respondents in almost every country on Earth. The results, which I've mapped out above, are as fascinating as they are indecipherable. The color-coded key in the map indicates the average percentage of people who answered \\"yes.\\" Dark purple countries are the most emotional, yellow the least. Here are a few takeaways. Singapore is the least emotional country in the world. \\"Singaporeans recognize they have a problem,\\" Bloomberg Businessweek writes of the country's \\"emotional deficit,\\" citing a culture in which schools \\"discourage students from thinking of themselves as individuals.\\" They also point to low work satisfaction, competitiveness, and the urban experience: \\"Staying emotionally neutral could be a way of coping with the stress of urban life in a place where 82 percent of the population lives in government-built housing.\\" The Philippines is the world's most emotional country. It's not even close; the heavily Catholic, Southeast Asian nation, a former colony of Spain and the U.S., scores well above second-ranked El Salvador. Post-Soviet countries are consistently among the most stoic. Other than Singapore (and, for some reason, Madagascar and Nepal), the least emotional countries in the world are all former members of the Soviet Union. They are also the greatest consumers of cigarettes and alcohol. This could be what you call and chicken-or-egg problem: if the two trends are related, which one came first? Europe appears almost like a gradient here, with emotions increasing as you move West. People in the Americas are just exuberant. Every nation on the North and South American continents ranked highly on the survey. Americans and Canadians are both among the 15 most emotional countries in the world, as well as ten Latin countries. The only non-American countries in the top 15, other than the Philippines, are the Arab nations of Oman and Bahrain, both of which rank very highly. English- and Spanish-speaking societies tend to be highly emotional and happy. Though the Anglophone nations of the world retain deep cultural links, it's not clear if Spain's emotional depth has anything to do with Latin America's. According to Gallup, \\"Latin America leads the world when it comes to positive emotions, with Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela at the top of that list.\\" Yes, even Hugo Chavez's Venezuela is apparently filled with happy people. Africans are generally stoic, with some significant exceptions. The continent is among the world's least emotional, though there is wide variation, which serves as a non-definitive but interesting reminder of Africa's cultural diversity. Each could be its own captivating case study. It's possible that South Africa's high rating has to do with its cultural ties to Western Europe, for example, and Nigeria's may have to do with the recent protest movement in the south and sectarian violence in the north. The Middle East is not happy. Gallup notes, \\"Negative emotions are highest in the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraq, Bahrain, and the Palestinian Territories leading the world in negative daily experiences.\\" Still, that doesn't quite fully explain the high emotions in the Levant and on the Arabian peninsula, compared to the lower emotions in Libya, Algeria, and Morocco. Perhaps this hints at how people in these countries are being affected by the still-ongoing political turmoil of the Arab Spring. What am I missing? Every color-coded national boundary here tells a story. Why is Haiti so bereft of emotion compared to its neighbors? Why is Angola so heavy with feeling? Leave your thoughts in the comments or reach me on social media. ||||| WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Singaporeans are the least likely in the world to report experiencing emotions of any kind on a daily basis. The 36% who report feeling either positive or negative emotions is the lowest in the world. Filipinos, on the other hand, are the most emotional, with six in 10 saying they experience a lot of these feelings daily. See the full list of countries on page 2. Gallup measures daily emotions in more than 150 countries and areas by asking residents whether they experienced five positive and five negative emotions a lot the previous day. Negative experiences include anger, stress, sadness, physical pain, and worry. Positive emotions include feeling well-rested, being treated with respect, enjoyment, smiling and laughing a lot, and learning or doing something interesting. To measure the presence or absence of emotions, Gallup averaged together the percentage of residents in each country who said they experienced each of the 10 positive and negative emotions. Negative emotions are highest in the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraq, Bahrain, and the Palestinian Territories leading the world in negative daily experiences. Latin America leads the world when it comes to positive emotions, with Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela at the top of that list. Implications Behavioral indicators such as positive and negative emotions are a vital measure of a society's wellbeing. Leaders worldwide are starting to incorporate such behavioral-based indicators into the metrics they use to evaluate their countries because they realize that traditional economic indicators such as GDP and 40-hour workweeks alone do not, and cannot, quantify the human condition. While higher incomes may improve people's emotional wellbeing, they can only do so to a certain extent. In the United States, for example, Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman and Princeton economist Angus Deaton found that after individuals make 75,000 annually, additional income will have little meaningful effect on how they experience their lives. Consider this finding in the context of Singapore, a country with one of the lowest unemployment rates and highest GDP per capita rates in the world, but a place where residents barely experience any positive emotions. This research shows that it will take more than higher incomes to increase positive emotions or decrease negative emotions. Singapore leadership needs to consider strategies that lie outside of the traditional confines of classic economics and would be well-advised to include wellbeing in its overall strategies if it is going to further improve the lives of its citizenry. Read more about Singapore's emotion deficit in Bloomberg Businessweek. For complete data sets or custom research from the more than 150 countries Gallup continually surveys, please contact us. Survey Methods Results are based on telephone and face-to-face interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, aged 15 and older, in each country each year between 2009 and 2011. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error ranges from ±0.4 percentage points to ±3.8 percentage points. The margin of error reflects the influence of data weighting. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album?, using the article: Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album is Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". The reasoning behind this is simple: the information given in the article specifies that the David Live album \\"spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's 'Knock on Wood'\\".

Use a putty knife to scrape off any raised fragments around the holes. Smooth down the nail holes with fine-grit sandpaper.\\"","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Repairing and Refinishing Wood Trim Introduction: Maintaining the appearance and functionality of wood trim is essential for preserving the beauty and value of your home. Once in a while, you may find protruding nails or cracks in your trim that can be unsightly and even lead to further damage if left unattended. In this article, we will discuss in detail how to hammer in protruding nails, remove raised fragments, and smooth down nail holes in your wood trim using a nail set, a putty knife, and fine-grit sandpaper. Step 1: Inspect the Trim The first step is to thoroughly inspect the trim to identify areas where nails may be protruding or where there are any raised fragments around the nail holes. Pay attention to corners and joints where movement or shifting is more likely to occur. Step 2: Gather Your Tools To repair the trim, you will need a few essential tools. These include: 1. A nail set 2. A hammer 3. A putty knife 4. Fine-grit sandpaper 5. Wood filler or putty, if necessary 6. Safety goggles and gloves for protection Make sure you have these tools ready before you start the repair process. Step 3: Hammer in Protruding Nails Put on your safety goggles and gloves, as small fragments or debris may become airborne during this process. Once you have identified a protruding nail, place the narrow end of the nail set on the nailhead. Hold the nail set securely with one hand and gently tap the other end of the nail set with the hammer. This will push the nail back into the trim and below the wood surface. Make sure to hammer the nail gently to avoid causing damage to the trim or to the surrounding wall. Step 4: Scrape off Raised Fragments Next, take your putty knife and gently scrape away any raised fragments around the nail holes. Be careful not to gouge the wood or scratch the surrounding surfaces. The goal is only to remove loose or splintered wood that may have been forced up by the protruding nail. Step 5: Sand Down Nail Holes Using the fine-grit sandpaper, gently sand down the nail holes and the area around them to create a smooth, even finish. Sanding will remove any remaining raised fragments and will prepare the surface for any additional touch-ups or refinishing if required. Step 6: Apply Wood Filler (Optional) If desired, you can use wood filler or putty to fill in the nail holes and gaps in the trim. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to apply and allow it to dry according to the recommended drying time. After the filler has dried, you can use fine-grit sandpaper to sand it down to ensure a seamless finish. Step 7: Refinish the Trim (Optional) If necessary, apply a fresh coat of paint or stain to the trim that matches the existing finish. Be sure to follow proper application techniques and use a high-quality paintbrush or sponge for an even, professional-looking result. Once the paint or stain is dry, your trim will look freshly installed and seamlessly integrated into your home. Conclusion: Maintaining and repairing your wood trim is essential for preserving the beauty and value of your home. By following these steps, you can effectively hammer in any protruding nails, remove raised fragments, and sand down nail holes in your trim to ensure it remains in top-tier condition. With a few essential tools, a little time, and attention to detail, you can transform and maintain the appearance of your trim and give your home a polished, well-cared-for appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Once I find relevant information about \\"Freedom+\\", I would then summarize the findings to provide a concise definition. --- Task 2: Determine the freedoms women have. Step 1: Understand the context. Recognize that women's freedoms vary widely depending on the cultural, political, economic, and social context. The inquiry is broad, as it does not specify a particular location or time period. Step 2: Provide a general overview. Given the broad nature of the question, I would provide an overview of some key freedoms that women have generally fought for and achieved throughout history, such as voting rights, property ownership, reproductive rights, equal pay, etc. Note that these freedoms may not be universally enjoyed by all women. --- Task 3: Determine whether the two questions have the same meaning. Step 1: Analyze the message of both questions. Upon reviewing the questions, I can see that they are asking different things. The first question is related to the term \\"Freedom+\\", which is likely about enhanced freedom in a particular context, without any specific mention of women. The second question is focused on the freedoms women have. Step 2: Compare the subject matter. The primary subjects in these questions differ—the first is focused on defining a term or concept, while the second centers around specific freedoms for women. Step 3: Provide a conclusion. Based on the analysis and comparison, I can conclude that the two questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different subjects and seek different information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who suffered heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971?, using the article: In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer is Shostakovich. The person who suffered from heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971, as mentioned in the given text, is named Dmitri Shostakovich. Therefore, Shostakovich is his last name. The text provides information about Shostakovich's health challenges, including suffering from multiple heart attacks in the mentioned years.

Because they are American tourists and therefore \\"above suspicion,\\" they find themselves commissioned by the British secret service to find an apparently missing scientist who has developed a countermeasure against a new Nazi secret weapon, a magnetic sea mine.[3] Without knowing his name, what he looks like, or where to find him, the couple look upon the search as adventurous and cross Europe seeking clues from clandestine contacts. In Paris, Frances is given a hat decorated with a rose as a signal for their first contact, who silently instructs them to go to a cafÃ© in Montmartre, where an unseen contact plants a tourist guidebook to southern Germany in Richard's coat.

Apple's iPhone 6 saves the day for Best Buy Best Buy BBY gave investors’ another pleasant surprise on Thursday, this time in part courtesy of Apple’s AAPL iPhone 6. The retailer, which many analysts for years had written off as a relic destined to disappear, keeps coming back with strong results, defying conventional wisdom and maintaining its appeal with shoppers who could easily buy its electronics on line. Best Buy on Thursday reported U.S. comparable sales unexpectedly rose 0.6% in the quarter ended May 3, easily beating Wall Street forecasts for a 0.4% decline, according to Consensus Metrix, and helping it post a stronger than expected profit. It’s not the first time that electronics retailer benefit from a runaway hit, of course, but Best Buy has in the last few years positioned itself to benefit better than most from such blockbuster products. “We continued to take advantage of strong product cycles in large screen televisions and iconic mobile phones,” said CEO Hubert Joly said. Those iconic mobile phones would of course largely be the iPhone 6, launched last winter, as well as Samsung’s Galaxy 6. Best Buy also got some help from large TVs and its growing big appliance business (that it appears to be taking in part from Sears SHLD ). The retailer has been fighting back using the very thing people thought condemned it to obsolescence: its stores. The chain’s growth plan is anchored on focusing on top brands in electronics and giving them a lot more prominence in stores. In 2014, it opened showrooms within its stores to showcase case products by Sony and Samsung. It has also previously had shop-in-shops for products by Microsoft MSFT and Beats headphones. And it has done a stellar job of integrating its e-commerce and stores for services like in-store pickup for online orders. These are some of reasons hit products like the iPhone have helped Best Buy but not RadioShack or hhgregg. This “is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market,” Joly said. The strong quarter follows a big rise in U.S. sales over the holiday season, belying the long held notion that Best Buy can’t keep up with the aggressive pricing of Amazon.com, AMZN Walmart WMT and Target TGT . There was more good news from Best Buy: total company sales for the current quarter are set to decline less than Wall Street analysts expected (Best Buy is in the process of exiting China, and closing dozens of Canadian stores) because of what Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam called “a strengthening domestic consumer-electronics market.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Best Buy reported an unexpected rise in U.S. comparable sales, largely due to the strong sales of Apple's iPhone 6, large TVs, and its growing big appliance business.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Santa Clara gets a sweeter offer from 49ers Santa Clara residents are now facing a much sweeter offer to build a 68,500-seat stadium for the San Francisco 49ers in the South Bay city than the team had suggested almost two years ago. The parameters of a complex deal hashed out between the city and team, released late Friday, call for Santa Clara to contribute 79 million toward the 937 million project, a major reduction from the 222 million in public contributions the team had sought in 2007. There would be no new taxes or money taken from the city's general fund. Instead, the bulk of the city's contribution would come from 42 million in redevelopment funds, which can be spent only on specific types of projects. \\"I think it's a great deal,\\" Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan said. \\"This is an investment to get repaid. I do believe this is absolutely the best deal the city could have possibly negotiated.\\" City officials have touted the potential economic benefit of the stadium, including a projected 41 million annual injection into Santa Clara's economy and the creation of about 500 jobs, which critics have said would be largely low-paying. Whether the deal is good enough will be decided by Santa Clara voters, who will have the ultimate say on whether the project should go forward. If they do, it could mark the death knell for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's efforts to keep the team in the city with a new stadium as the centerpiece of a revitalized Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. Team officials are optimistic they will have a new game-day home next to their Santa Clara headquarters in time for the 2014 football season. \\"We're committed to making this work,\\" Niners Chief Financial Officer Larry MacNeil said. \\"We want to make this work, and we think we can make it work.\\" The proposal to relocate the five-time Super Bowl champions from the city where they've played their games since 1946 calls for public funds to subsidize about 8 percent of the project's costs, while having the team pay the city at least 1 million in rent a year on average for 40 years, plus millions more based on a cut of stadium revenue. Over the course of the 40-year lease, the team projects it will pay the city 196 million in rent. The team also would cover the cost of game-day law enforcement, any construction cost overruns, operating cost loses and front the city 12 million for the redevelopment fund if needed. The plan calls for the city to contribute 42 million from redevelopment funds, plus 20 million to move an electricity station at the proposed stadium site - one of two city-owned parking lots currently leased to the Great America theme park. The city portion also includes 17 million as part of the cost of building a parking garage at the site, although that money had already been raised because the garage was originally designed to serve the Santa Clara Convention Center across the street. An additional 35 million would come from a 2 percent tax on hotel guests, with the remaining 823 million coming from the team, the NFL, ticket fees and selling naming and concession rights. Skeptics of the plan have questioned whether the league, whose stadium fund was depleted last year, will pony up for a Santa Clara project. The league said Friday in a brief statement that it is pleased by they agreement and will \\"continue to facilitate support for new construction.\\" Some critics are concerned about an increase in traffic, while others oppose any public subsidy for a stadium. If approved, the deal would also trigger 141 million in funding for the Santa Clara Unified School District, team officials said, due to a provision in the use of redevelopment funds. It also calls for a 35-cent per-ticket surcharge that would generate about 250,000 annually for youth athletics, libraries and a senior center. \\"What I'm really excited about this deal is it takes redevelopment money and turns it into general fund money,\\" said City Councilman Kevin Moore, a leading proponent of trying to get the stadium. The next step comes Tuesday, when the Santa Clara City Council is set to take up the proposal at its meeting and potentially vote on whether to back it. City Manager Jennifer Sparacino and staff, who negotiated the deal, have recommended the package be approved. If it is, it would probably go before voters in March, by which time an environmental impact study is projected to be completed.","completion":"Santa Clara is thinking about building a big stadium for the San Francisco 49ers football team. They talked about a plan to spend 79 million on the project, which will cost 937 million in total. This is much better than the 222 million they talked about two years ago. The money will come from special funds and not from new taxes. Some people think the stadium will be good for the city because it will bring more money and create jobs. The people of Santa Clara will vote if they want the stadium or not. If they say yes, the stadium might be finished by 2014."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: \\"In Cold Blood\\", adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on. Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the editing. Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations. Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in the review of \\"In Cold Blood\\" is primarily positive, with some minor critiques. The reviewer praises the film for its character study of the killers, particularly Perry Smith played by Robert Blake. The cast, despite not having many recognizable names, is commended for bringing the story to life. Both Robert Blake and Scott Wilson's performances are specifically applauded for their on-screen chemistry and dynamic portrayal of their characters. The reviewer also compliments Richard Brooks' script and direction, although mentioning a minor issue with some ill-advised narration in the later stages of the film. The cinematography by Conrad Hall, editing, and Quincy Jones' jazzy score are highly appreciated as well. One notable aspect of the review is the mention that the film does not glamorize violence, instead providing an alternative view on the killers, making them pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. While this might spark some disagreements, the reviewer appreciates that the movie presents a different approach from the typical Hollywood crime films. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is predominantly positive, as the reviewer appreciates the character development, performances, and technical aspects of the film. The reviewer recommends the film, despite some minor issues mentioned, for its unique approach to crime and the excellence with which it is executed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPAL is a high-level interface for low-level physics engines used in games , robotics simulations , and other 3D applications .","completion":"While these two sentences appear to be very similar at first glance, they convey slightly different meanings due to the placement of hyphens and commas. 1. OPAL is a high-level interface for low - level - physics engines used in games, robotics simulations and other 3D applications. In this sentence, the placement of hyphens suggests that OPAL is a high-level interface designed for \\"low-level-physics\\" engines, which implies that the physics engines handle low-level physics specifically. The lack of an Oxford comma before \\"and other 3D applications\\" may lead to some ambiguity, as it could be interpreted as the \\"other 3D applications\\" being part of the \\"robotics simulations\\" category. However, this is a minor difference and might not have much impact on the overall interpretation of the sentence. 2. OPAL is a high-level interface for low-level physics engines used in games, robotics simulations, and other 3D applications. In this sentence, the absence of hyphens in \\"low-level physics\\" suggests that OPAL is a high-level interface for physics engines that are low-level, referring to the engines' abstraction level rather than the specific type of physics they handle. The inclusion of the Oxford comma before \\"and other 3D applications\\" clearly delineates the three different categories of applications where OPAL can be used: games, robotics simulations, and other 3D applications. So, although both sentences convey the general idea that OPAL is a high-level interface for certain types of physics engines used in various applications, the subtle differences in punctuation result in slightly different interpretations of the exact nature of these physics engines and the specific application categories they are used in."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.

Write an article based on this summary: The number of first-time buyers relying on the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" for financial help has hit a record high, according to new research.","completion":"Title: First-time Home Buyers Turn to 'Bank of Mum and Dad' in Record Numbers Introduction The path to homeownership has become increasingly difficult for first-time buyers, with soaring property prices and an increasingly competitive housing market. In recent years, more and more aspiring homebuyers have turned to their families for financial assistance. According to new research, this trend has reached a record high, with an unprecedented number of first-time buyers relying on the so-called \\"bank of mum and dad\\" for help getting onto the property ladder. Soaring property prices The rise in the number of first-time buyers seeking help from family members is in large part due to skyrocketing property prices in the country. Over the last decade, the average price of a home has risen considerably, making it harder for many first-time buyers to save up for a deposit to secure a mortgage. The high cost of living, combined with the challenge of saving money while paying rent, has further compounded the problem. Housing market competition Another reason for the increased need for financial help from parents and other family members is the intense competition in the housing market. The demand for affordable and suitable properties far outstrips the supply, which has inevitably led to bidding wars and inflated prices. Prospective homeowners, particularly first-time buyers, often find it challenging to compete with those who have more financial resources at their disposal, such as property investors and second-home buyers. The role of the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" In light of these challenges, the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" has become an essential source of financial support for many aspiring homeowners. Parents and other family members are increasingly stepping in to help cover the costs of deposits and to provide financial guarantees, allowing first-time buyers to secure a mortgage and ultimately purchase a property. This trend has significant implications for both families and the wider property market. On the one hand, helping a family member onto the property ladder can be seen as a wise long-term investment that benefits both parties; the first-time buyer gains a valuable asset and the assisting family member can potentially see a return on investment in the form of increased property values. On the other hand, the reliance on family assistance can have its drawbacks. It can exacerbate socioeconomic inequality by benefiting those who already have access to financial support, perpetuating a cycle of wealth inequality. Additionally, the increasing dependence on the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" has raised concerns about the financial sustainability of such arrangements, particularly in cases where the helping family member may also be facing financial insecurity. Government measures to support first-time buyers Recognizing the challenges faced by first-time buyers, governments have introduced various measures to provide support, such as affordable housing schemes and mortgage guarantee programs. While these measures have helped some first-time buyers enter the property market, the high demand for assistance and the limited availability of such programs mean that many aspiring homeowners continue to rely on the \\"bank of mum and dad.\\" Conclusion The record-high reliance on the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" highlights the significant obstacles facing first-time homebuyers in today's competitive and expensive property market. While family assistance can be a valuable lifeline, it is essential to consider the broader implications of this trend, such as the potential impact on wealth inequality and financial sustainability. Efforts to reduce the reliance on the family assistance and create a fair and accessible property market should be ongoing. This can be achieved by implementing policies that address housing supply issues, encourage affordable housing development, and provide targeted support for those who struggle to save for a deposit or compete in the property market. By doing so, homeownership may become a more attainable goal for the many first-time buyers still striving to get on the property ladder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless. Q: Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to what is the likely cause? A: Answer:","completion":"When higher amounts of protein are found in urine, the likely cause of this finding is damage to the glomeruli. The glomeruli are a crucial part of the nephrons in the kidneys, responsible for filtering blood to remove waste products and excess substances while retaining important elements, such as proteins, to be reabsorbed by the body. When the glomeruli are damaged, they can become less effective at selectively filtering the blood, which allows more protein to pass through into the urine. This increase in protein levels in the urine can be indicative of renal disease or an underlying issue within the kidneys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Recognizing the severity of the situation, management announced a sweeping plan to cut costs by reducing their workforce by 40%. This significant reduction is expected to streamline the company's operations and refocus its efforts on a smaller, more targeted product line. The acquisition by the largest shareholder reinforces the belief that BlackBerry can weather this storm and eventually emerge stronger. The new owner's financial support, coupled with the aggressive cost-cutting measures, is expected to provide sufficient resources for the company to innovate and revamp its product lineup to better compete in today's rapidly evolving smartphone market. Conclusion: In summary, BlackBerry's acquisition by its biggest shareholder, following the announcement of near-1 billion losses and severe workforce reductions, represents a pivotal moment for the company. This change of ownership, alongside its cost-cutting measures, is anticipated to breathe new life into the struggling brand. As BlackBerry embarks on this new chapter, it remains to be seen whether these actions will be enough to secure the company's future in the ever-competitive smartphone industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article in one sentence. You should never go to class on an empty stomach. Hunger pangs can easily distract you from the curriculum. Always have something to eat before a class. In a morning class especially, make sure to get up in time for breakfast. If you don't have time for a big meal, grab something small. A piece of toast or a bowl of yogurt can really help you focus during class. Prior to class, make a list of reasons you sometimes have trouble concentrating. This can include things like checking your phone, a noisy classroom, and a tendency to daydream. Then, write down ways you can combat these problems. For example, you can write down something like, \\"I can't resist the temptation to check my phone when I hear it buzz in my pocket.\\" Think of a way to eliminate this distraction. For example, \\"I should turn my phone off before class.\\" Unless a laptop is required for class, leave yours behind. You'll be able to focus more when you take notes by hand as you're less likely to be distracted by a lingering internet browser. Install a program on your computer to block out your favorite social media sites during the specific times you’re in class or open a new window so you aren’t distracted. It's okay to bring your phone, as you may need it for directions immediately after class. However, be sure to power it down before class begins. Exercise can help you focus. If you have time, get a workout in before class in the morning. If you don't have time for a full workout, some light exercise can help. Go for a short walk before class or do some light cardio in your apartment. If you typically drive to class, try walking or biking instead.

Article: My son has poliomyelitis and he suffered from it a lot. When he was young, my wife and I took him to see so many doctors and got different kinds of treatments. But still, he couldn't walk like a normal kid. So he was laughed at by his peers for his walking style. His tears burnt our eyes like sulphuric acid . Then, he became afraid of going to school. He wouldn't go anymore. One night, my wife had a breakdown and shouted at him, \\"I tell you, my kid, you might be like this forever. You are a freak in other people's eyes, and perhaps it would never change. But in my eyes, in your dad's eyes, you are not a freak! You are not! Even if you are, we love you and we will love you forever!\\" My son spoke nothing for two days. He didn't eat or sleep. We could read he was hurt.

Write an article based on this summary: Spray the stink bugs you see with a soap, water, and lavender oil solution. Use a neem oil spray to prevent stink bugs from laying new eggs. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth (DE) around your property to kill bugs when they try to enter.","completion":"Title: Sustainable Stink Bug Control: A Natural Approach to Save Your Garden Introduction Gardeners and homeowners alike dread the invasion of stink bugs. These pesky insects not only emit a foul smell when disturbed, but also cause major damage to fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. With their growing populations and resistance to traditional pesticides, it is crucial that we find natural and eco-friendly ways to tackle these bothersome pests. In this article, we highlight three non-toxic methods to manage stink bugs: using a soap, water, and lavender oil solution to kill them; applying neem oil to deter them from laying eggs; and sprinkling diatomaceous earth to eliminate any remaining stragglers. 1. Soap, Water, and Lavender Oil Solution: A Potent Spray for Stink Bugs The first line of defense against stink bugs is a simple homemade solution consisting of soap, water, and lavender oil. Not only is this spray effective at eliminating stink bugs, but it is also safe for the environment, pets, and humans. To create this bug-fighting spray, fill a spray bottle with one part dish soap, fifteen parts water, and a few drops of lavender essential oil. Shake well to combine all the ingredients. When you spot stink bugs on your plants or around your home, simply spritz them generously with this mixture. The soap suffocates the bugs by creating a layer over their respiratory systems, while lavender oil repels other stink bugs with its strong scent. By using this solution regularly, you can significantly reduce the number of stink bugs residing in your garden or home. 2. Neem Oil: A Natural Insecticide to Deter Egg Laying Neem oil is a powerful, organic insecticide derived from the seeds of the neem tree. With its ability to disrupt the reproductive cycle of insects, it can effectively discourage stink bugs from laying eggs on your plants. Additionally, neem oil is safe for beneficial insects like bees and butterflies, so you can maintain a balanced garden ecosystem. To make a neem oil spray, mix two tablespoons of neem oil, one tablespoon of mild liquid soap, and one gallon of water in a large container. Fill a spray bottle with this mixture, and apply it to your plants, paying particular attention to the undersides of leaves where stink bugs are likely to lay eggs. Neem oil has a strong odor, which dissipates quickly, but can still be an effective deterrent. Regular applications of neem oil every one to two weeks can significantly decrease the number of new stink bugs invading your garden. 3. Diatomaceous Earth: A Deadly Barrier Against Stink Bug Invaders Sprinkling diatomaceous earth (DE) around your property is another effective method to eliminate stink bugs. Diatomaceous earth is made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. This abrasive powder is highly effective at killing insects by damaging their exoskeletons and causing dehydration. To use diatomaceous earth, simply sprinkle it around the perimeter of your garden, around windows, doors, and any other entry points for stink bugs. Make sure to use food-grade DE, which is safe for humans, pets, and plants. When stink bugs come into contact with the DE, their exoskeletons will be damaged, and they will eventually die of dehydration. This method provides a long-lasting barrier against stink bugs, as long as the DE remains dry. Reapply after heavy rain or if you notice an increase in stink bug activity. Conclusion By employing these three natural methods, gardeners and homeowners can effectively combat stink bug infestations without resorting to chemical pesticides. These solutions not only protect your plants, but also maintain the ecological balance in your garden by preserving beneficial insects. In the fight against these invasive pests, eco-friendly options such as a soap, water, and lavender oil solution, neem oil, and diatomaceous earth help create a sustainable approach to garden management. With consistent use and diligent observation, you can enjoy a stink bug-free environment while protecting the environment and the creatures that share it with you."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up Answer:","completion":"The final step of this process is weathering and breaking down of rocks into smaller fragments, which may eventually form new sediments or contribute to soil formation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence and your task is to identify whether the sentence contains motion or not, by classifying the sentence into Yes or No. The sentence belongs to the 'Yes' category if there is an occurrence of a motion of a physical entity otherwise the sentence belongs to the 'No' category. The sentence contains motion if it (i) involves the movement of a physical object. (ii) contains verb in present tense indicating the action performed. Sometimes there can be verb which indicates a motion but the motion might have happened in the past and the answers to such sentences is 'No' Input: When he opened the door it seemed to his fancy that the wax tapers burned but dimly amid the shadows of the great room, and that the pictured faces hanging on the walls looked white and gazed as if aghast. Output:","completion":"Yes Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the presence of physical objects and verbs. In the sentence, we have physical objects such as door, wax tapers, great room, and pictured faces on the walls. We also have verbs like \\"opened\\", \\"seemed\\", \\"burned\\", and \\"gazed\\". Step 2: Analyze the verbs to see if they indicate motion in the present tense. \\"Opened\\" indicates motion (opening door) in the past tense, \\"seemed\\" is not associated with motion, \\"burned\\" is in the past tense and not indicating motion, and \\"gazed\\" doesn't indicate motion either. Step 3: Determine if there is any verb that indicates motion in the present tense. There are no verbs in the sentence indicating motion in the present tense. However, the sentence describes the scene as it appears in the present, with dimly burning wax tapers and pictured faces gazing in a particular way. Step 4: Make a decision. The sentence involves the movement of a physical object (opening the door); however, the verb \\"opened\\" is in the past tense. Even though the motion happened in the past, it triggered the scene that is described as being perceived in the present moment. Therefore, the sentence is classified as \\"Yes\\" because it contains motion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines will likely help reduce ear infections. You and every member of your family should also get a flu vaccination every year. Vaccinating yourself will help keep both you and your family safer from infection. Experts recommend that you use the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children. Ask your pediatrician for advice. Wash your child's hands, toys and play surfaces frequently to reduce the likelihood of infection. Pacifiers can be vectors for bacteria, including bacteria that causes ear infections. Leakage is more likely to occur in bottle-feeding than it is in breastfeeding, making the transmission of bacteria higher. Breastfeeding also boosts your child’s immune system, helping him or her to fight off infections easier. If bottle-feeding is necessary, place the child in an upright seat so that liquids drip down instead of possibly into their ear. Never give a baby a bottle while s/he is going down for a nap or to sleep at night. Do this both for the sake of preventing ear infections and for general health and safety. Prolonged usage of antibiotics can leave certain bacteria in your body or your child's body resistant to the effects of certain drugs. Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor, or when other options aren't available. These facilities put your child at a 50% greater chance of developing an ear infection due to the common transmission of infections both bacterial and viral. If you cannot avoid sending your child to daycare, teach him or her a few tactics to help avoid the spread of infections such as colds, which can cause ear infections. Teach your child not to put toys or fingers in his or her mouth. S/he should avoid touching the face with his or her hands, especially mucous membrane areas such as the mouth, eyes, and nose. S/he should wash hands after eating and after using the bathroom. Eating a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins helps your body stay strong and healthy. Some research also suggests that \\"good\\" bacteria such as probiotics may help protect your body from infection. Acidophilus is a commonly studied strain of probiotic. You can find it in many yogurts. Summary:","completion":"Immunizations can help prevent serious bacterial infections, and seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines may reduce ear infections. Annual flu vaccinations are recommended for everyone in the family to promote overall health and safety. For children, the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is suggested, and frequent hand washing and cleaning of toys and surfaces can lower infection risks. Pacifiers and bottle-feeding may contribute to the spread of bacteria, so breastfeeding is encouraged for its immune-boosting benefits. When bottle-feeding, ensure the child is upright and avoid giving a bottle during naps or bedtime. Use antibiotics only when prescribed and necessary to avoid resistance. If daycare is unavoidable, teach children good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of infections. A healthy diet and intake of probiotics, such as acidophilus found in yogurt, can strengthen the immune system and protect against infections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Personal money-management website Mint.com suggests recently that responsible parents should give their kids credit cards--possibly starting as young as middle school. The website says a credit card will help children master responsible spending habits and give parents the chance to teach them some valuable lessons. It's absolutely true that kids should learn about how a credit card works and how to use it responsibly. But the idea that they need a card of their own to practise this is questionable. Yes, credit cards are a teaching tool, but it's the time you spend educating them about money management that does the teaching, not the piece of plastic. Sit down with your child--here we are referring to teens and walk them through your credit card statements. Point out important things like the due date, late fee warning, and APR . If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment. Since the card is still in your name, you can take them off it at any point and cut off their access if they're not able to handle the responsibility. Another option is to set them up with an account at a local bank that offers free use of a debit card . Unlike credit card, the debit card has no overdraft function. Children can only use the card to pay for things and the money is taken directly from their bank account. If the account is empty, the worst that will happen is the card being declined at a cash register. Options: A To avoid extremely high overdraft fees. B To encourage them to share household expenses.

Amy, an experienced gardener, noticed the difference and decided to take some action. Step 1: Analyze the situation Amy observed her garden and saw that the flowers in the pots were thriving, while the ones in the ground were struggling. She suspected that the fertilizer in the store-bought potting soil was making a significant difference. Step 2: Research Before making any changes, Amy decided to research the fertilizer used in the potting soil. She visited the store where she had bought her supplies and learned that the soil in the pots had a mix of essential nutrients, specifically designed to support flower growth. She took note of the ingredients to look for a suitable alternative for her other plants. Step 3: Create a plan With her new knowledge, Amy decided to create a plan to improve the growth of the flowers in the ground. She would apply a similar fertilizer mix to the earth, while also taking care of other factors like water, sunlight, and positioning. She sketched out a plan and set goals for each task, committing to follow it for the next few weeks. Step 4: Prepare and apply fertilizer Amy went shopping for an appropriate fertilizer that matched the mix she learned about earlier. Once she found the right product, she prepared the ground by loosening the soil around the flowers and mixed the fertilizer with earth as per the product's instructions. She made sure not to over-apply, as too much fertilizer can be harmful to the plants. Step 5: Monitor progress and adjust the approach Over the following weeks, Amy monitored the progress of her flowers, paying close attention to their growth and overall health. She took note of any changes and made adjustments to her care routine as needed, such as watering more or less, depending on the weather conditions and specific needs of each plant species. Step 6: Share knowledge Seeing the positive results in her garden, she decided to share her knowledge with other gardening enthusiasts in her community. She posted before-and-after pictures of her flowers on social media, along with a detailed explanation of the steps she took to achieve these results. Her friends and neighbors appreciated her tips and started implementing some of these practices in their own gardens. As a result, the community gardens flourished, filling the neighborhood with color and beauty. By following these steps, Amy was able to bridge the gap between the growth of the potted flowers and those planted in the ground. The process not only improved the overall appearance of her garden but also allowed her to help others in her community to create vibrant, healthy gardens as well."},{"prompt":"If I tell you that If food is not immediately used for energy then that food will be converted into fat, and ask you the question \\"if food is not immediately used for energy then that food will be converted into what\\", is the correct answer \\"glucose\\"?

Question: suppose the climate changes dramatically happens, how will it affect less affected rain to fall. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The climate change could have an effect on the rate at which less affected rain falls. To determine whether this effect will be more, less, or have no effect on the phenomenon, we will consider the following steps: Step 1: Analyze the reasons for dramatic climate change Dramatic climate change could be due to factors like increased greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and other human activities. These factors can have various impacts on weather patterns, temperature, and precipitation. Step 2: Examine the link between climate change and rain patterns The altered climate can cause changes in the formation of clouds, the frequency of rain, and the intensity of rainfall events. These changes can lead to either an increase or decrease of precipitation in different regions, affecting the rate at which less affected rain falls. Step 3: Calculate the implications of climate change on chemical compounds The release of chemical compounds into the air due to human industry might also be affected by climate change. Changes in temperature, air currents, and other atmospheric factors may alter the distribution of these pollutants and their reactions within clouds. Step 4: Evaluate the impact of climate change on the second effect The second effect mentioned is the harm caused to natural and man-made objects due to the acidic content of the affected rain. If climate change leads to a situation where less affected rain falls more frequently, the overall harm to objects should decrease. However, if climate change results in less frequent, less affected rain, the damages caused by the remaining acidic rain might be more concentrated. Conclusion: In this case, it is challenging to conclusively state if the effect of the supposed perturbation on the less affected rain will be more, less, or have no effect on the overall harm caused by the affected rain to natural and man-made objects. The overall impact will depend on the specific changes in climate patterns and how they directly influence regional precipitation and chemical compounds distribution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

Question: Question: \\"In what year did Espartero's rule end?\\" Context: \\"During the regency of Maria Cristina, Espartero ruled Spain for two years as its 18th Prime Minister from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. Under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies. During this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders were national property—though in Valencia, most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie. City life in Valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate, with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans, and the constant threat of reprisals by the Carlist troops of General Cabrera.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Baldomero Espartero, a prominent figure in Spanish history, took the reins of power as the 18th Prime Minister during a turbulent time in the country's past. Born on October 27, 1793, in Granátula de Calatrava, Spain, Espartero emerged as a skilled military leader who played a key role in the Carlist Wars, which spanned from 1833 to 1839. His military prowess elevated him to political prominence, culminating in his appointment as the regent during the minority of Queen Isabella II. Espartero's rule commenced on September 16, 1840, following the regency of Maria Cristina, the queen mother. His tenure as Prime Minister saw the efforts to reconcile the conservative factions with the progressive forces in Spain, as divisions had arisen between the liberals and republicans. Amid this tumultuous backdrop, Espartero enacted several bold policies, one of which involved the declaration of Church estates, congregations, and religious orders as national property. This move had significant ramifications, particularly in Valencia, where most of the Church's property was eventually acquired by the region's bourgeoisie. As Spain continued to experience unrest and social upheaval, Espartero's time in power ultimately came to an end on May 21, 1841. His two-year rule saw a number of both progressive and reconciliatory measures being implemented in order to mitigate the tension that had become pervasive throughout the nation. Despite these measures, conflicts persisted among the various factions, both before and after Espartero's term, contributing to the instability of the Spanish political landscape during that period. In conclusion, Espartero's rule as the 18th Prime Minister of Spain ended on May 21, 1841, after nearly two years in office. His tenure was characterized by efforts to quell the mounting discord between different groups within the country, while at the same time enacting policies that promoted progressive change. Although Espartero's rule was ultimately short-lived, his impact on the nation—particularly in the area of Church property—would endure for years to come."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on charlotte link 's: - residence - birth name - birth date - name - birth place - occupation Bio: charlotte link -lrb- born 5 october 1963 in frankfurt am main -rrb- is a german writer . she is among the most successful contemporary authors writing in german .

Which of these examples involving heat transfer occurs mainly by conduction? - OPT: (I). The sun warms the ground.; (II). A hot oven warms a cold kitchen.; (III). A campfire warms a person's hands.; (IV). Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle.;","completion":"Among the four examples provided, the one that mainly involves heat transfer by conduction is: (IV). Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle. To better understand why this is the case, let's first take a brief look at the three primary modes of heat transfer and then analyze each example. 1. Conduction: This is the process of heat transfer through a solid material, with molecules transferring energy to neighboring molecules via direct contact. Materials with high thermal conductivity, such as metals, transfer heat more readily than materials with low thermal conductivity, such as wood or plastic. 2. Convection: This process involves the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid, such as air or water, with warmer fluid rising and cooler fluid sinking. Convection can occur due to natural processes (such as warm air rising) or forced processes (such as a fan blowing air). 3. Radiation: This is the transfer of heat via electromagnetic waves, such as infrared, without the need for any physical medium to carry the energy. All objects emit some amount of thermal radiation, with the intensity increasing with the object's temperature. Now, let's analyze each example: (I). The sun warms the ground: This mainly involves heat transfer by radiation. The sun emits heat in the form of electromagnetic waves, which travel through the vacuum of space and are absorbed by the earth's surface, warming it up. (II). A hot oven warms a cold kitchen: This involves a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation. The walls of the oven are heated by conduction from the heating element. The oven then emits heat through radiation, warming the surrounding area. Additionally, the air around the oven is heated, and natural convection currents are created as warm air rises and cooler air sinks, distributing heat throughout the kitchen. (III). A campfire warms a person's hands: This primarily involves heat transfer by radiation and convection. The flames emit heat in the form of infrared radiation, which is absorbed by the person's hands and other nearby objects. Moreover, the air around the fire is heated, and natural convection currents help distribute the heat to the surroundings, including the person's hands. (IV). Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle: In this example, the main mode of heat transfer is conduction. When the metal spoon is placed in the hot soup, the molecules at the base of the spoon gain energy from the soup and begin to vibrate more rapidly. This energy is then transferred along the length of the handle through the spoon's metal structure via conduction, ultimately warming the handle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Embedded Systems: Which Freescale Kinetis MCU is a good drop-in replacement for an LPC4330? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from the following. [+] no; [+] yes;","completion":"Golang, also known as Go, is a programming language developed by Google with a focus on simplicity, safety, and performance. It is designed to handle and manage concurrent processing efficiently. Although Go is excellent for writing back-end services, web applications, and API servers, it is not traditionally known for its use in embedded systems. In the world of embedded systems, programming languages such as C and C++ are the most commonly used due to their efficiency, reliability, and toolchain support. These languages are widely favored in embedded systems since they offer low-level hardware control crucial for optimizing battery life, memory usage, and processing time for resource-constrained devices. However, Golang can still be used in certain embedded systems under specific conditions. In 2020, support for Go on the TinyGo compiler was announced by Google, allowing developers to use Golang on microcontrollers and other limited-capacity hardware. This step has opened up new possibilities for Golang in the world of embedded systems, especially on microcontrollers and IoT devices. Still, even though Golang has shown promise in expanding its presence in the embedded systems domain, it's important to recognize that the support and ecosystem are relatively limited compared to the established C and C++ languages. Depending on your project constraints and requirements, it's essential to weigh the language options carefully and choose the one that best fits your needs. As for the second question, if you are looking for a good drop-in replacement for the LPC4330 microcontroller (MCU) from NXP, you might want to consider the various alternatives within the Freescale (now a part of NXP) Kinetis MCU family. The LPC4330 is a dual-core MCU with an ARM Cortex-M4 processor paired with an ARM Cortex-M0 coprocessor. Identifying an exact drop-in replacement will depend on your specific use case and requirements from an MCU. It's essential to examine aspects such as processing speed, memory size, peripheral set, power consumption, and package size. One possible alternative is the Kinetis K6x series or Kinetis KV5x series of MCUs, both featuring ARM Cortex-M4 cores. These microcontrollers are designed to offer similar performance levels and feature sets, like the LPC4330, including high-speed USB On-The-Go (OTG), advanced PWM modules, and multiple GPIOs (general-purpose input/output pins). You may want to compare their specifications and chipsets to determine which one is the best match based on your needs. In conclusion, the two questions discussed are not the same. The first question evaluates if Golang is a suitable programming language for embedded systems, while the second question asks for a drop-in replacement for the LPC4330 MCU within the Freescale Kinetis family. Therefore, the correct choice of response is [+] no."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Movie title: Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Movie plot: Following the events of The New Blood, two graduating high school students are aboard on a houseboat. Jim tells his girlfriend Suzy the legend of Jason Voorhees, before playing a prank on her with a hockey mask and a fake knife. The boat sails over some underwater cables, which electrocute Jason's corpse and cause his resurrection. He sneaks on board and kills Jim with a harpoon gun before impaling Suzy, who tries to hide from him, with a barb. The next morning, the SS Lazarus is ready to set sail for New York City with a graduating senior class from Lakeview High School and chaperoned by biology teacher Charles McCulloch and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen. Van Deusen brings McCulloch's niece Rennie along for the trip despite her aquaphobia much to his chagrin. Jason sneaks on board and kills rock star wannabe J.J. with her guitar before hiding in the bowels of the ship. That night, after a boxing match, a young boxer who lost to champion Julius Gaw is killed when Jason slams a hot sauna rock into his abdomen while Rennie, searching for her pet Border Collie Toby, discovers prom queen Tamara and Eva doing drugs. McCulloch nearly catches them moments later and Tamara pushes Rennie overboard, suspecting she told on them. She then uses video student Wayne to record McCulloch in a compromising situation with her, but rejects Wayne's advances afterward. Tamara is killed by Jason with a shard of broken mirror when she goes to take a shower. Rennie begins seeing visions of a young Jason throughout the ship, but the others ignore the deckhand's warnings that Jason is aboard. Jason kills Captain Robertson and his first mate. Rennie's boyfriend, Sean, discovers them and tells the others before calling for an emergency stop. Eva is strangled as she tries to flee from Jason. The students agree to search for Jason while McCulloch decides that the deckhand is responsible; however, the deckhand is discovered with an axe in his back. One of the students, Miles, is killed by Jason and Julius is knocked overboard....
