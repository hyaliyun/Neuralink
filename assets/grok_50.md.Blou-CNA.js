It's April, Time to Do Some Spring Cleaning on Your Finances This bright, new season of the year is a great time to make a fresh start and spruce up your finances. Taking some time this spring to clean up your finances could help you save time and money for the rest of the year—and for years to come. Adjusting your payroll withholding, boosting your retirement contributions and automating savings and bill paying are three ways to get started on your financial \\"clean up.\\" Your 2014 taxes are in the process of being filed-or are already done! Now is the time to adjust your payroll withholding for this year. Payroll withholding is something you want to get just right because if you have too little in taxes taken out of your pay, you'll owe money when you file your return. If too much tax is withheld, you'll get a refund. That may seem like a good thing. But a refund really means you've given Uncle Sam free use of your money, which you probably could have made better use of yourself throughout the year. The goal is to become neither a borrower nor a lender. To make the change, file a new W-4 with your employer. This will change the amount that comes out of your paycheck. The IRS offers an interactive withholding allowance calculator to help you figure out just what changes you need to make to your withholding amount. Contribute as much as you can to your workplace retirement plan. If you're 50 or older, you can also put in an additional \\"catch up\\" contribution. The good news is that the IRS made a cost-of-living adjustment to 401(k) plans so, as of this year, you can put away 500 more than you were able to in the past. Contribute the maximum 18,000 to your 401(k) or 403(b) for the year if you can. And if you're 50 years or older, you can make an additional \\"catch-up\\" contribution of 6,000 for the year. IRA contributions limits are 5,500 and investors age 50 and older can contribute an additional 1,000 to their IRA. And don't forget that you have until the tax filing deadline of April 15 to make a contribution for 2014. There's still time! If you haven't set up an automatic savings plan, do it! Just as your income taxes are automatically deducted from your paycheck, you can do the same and pay yourself first. How? Have your bank set up an automatic transfer from your checking account each month into a savings account. If it's difficult to save a predetermined amount each month, sign up for various programs offered by banks to help you save small amounts. Bank of America has a \\"Keep the Change\\" program, which rounds up every dollar you spend and puts it away into a savings account. Wells Fargo has a similar program called \\"Way2Save.\\" It's hardly noticeable when you save a dollar here, a penny there, but it can add up quickly. Streamline your accounts by asking for online statements instead of paper bills. Pay your bills online too. Contact your bank to pay recurring bills automatically from your checking account. Fewer paper bills and statements will help keep your finances clutter-free… just in time for spring.

Two die after tornado strikes campground near Cape Charles, Va. A fierce storm packing powerful winds and rain toppled trees and flipped campers Thursday at a campground near Cape Charles, Va., east of Richmond, killing at least two people and sending at least 20 more to hospitals. (AP) The Chesapeake Bay went black and lightning became blinding as a lethal tornado whipped through a large campground near Cape Charles, Va., on Thursday morning. Amid the violent storm, a Jersey City couple were killed and their 13-year-old son gravely injured when a tree toppled on their tents, state police said. Campers, including vacationing emergency medical technicians, rushed into the rain and pounding hail when they heard cries for help and saw a wounded and dazed teen, said Julie Gallagher, 21, an EMT from Frank­linville, N.J. The teen, Gallagher said, “had a blank stare and said, ‘My parents are dead. I just watched my mommy die.’ My heart broke. I’ll never forget those words. Never.” State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller identified the couple as Lord N. Balatbat and Lolibeth E. Ortega, both 38. Their son, whom police did not identify, was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, Geller said during a news conference at the entrance to the Cherrystone Family Camping Resort, which is on the bay about 110 miles east of Richmond. State police said that about 1,300 campers and 40 employees were on the 300-acre waterfront site, which has become an annual summer getaway for families like Gallagher’s. In all, 36 people were injured and transported from the campground as a result of the tornado, state police said. Gallagher said she used a kayak as a flatboard to carry another young wounded child — who was near the New Jersey couple — to arriving ambulances. The storm tossed camping vehicles onto their roofs, state police said. One caught fire, recalled Gallagher, who said she passed others assisting at that scene as she ran toward voices calling for help. The storms struck the camping site about 8:30 a.m., said David Watson, a Virginia Department of Emergency Management spokesman. Pine cones were hurled against sliding doors in her cottage and hail “like baseballs” hit during the fiercest point, said Gallagher’s sister, Victoria Thomas, 27 of Monroeville, N.J. “It went on like that for 10 minutes but felt like five hours. You couldn’t see six inches in front of you.” The storm, which state police said was an EF-1 tornado, was brutish enough that it also overturned a tractor-trailer. Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital in Nassawadox, Va., treated 26 people injured in the storm, “most if not all from the campground,” said Peter Glagola, a hospital spokesman. He said most were treated and released. The son of the couple killed was transported to Children’s Hospital of the Kings Daughters in Norfolk, state police said. Mike Rusnak, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office, said a tornado warning went out 10 minutes before the storm touched land in Northampton County. “The bay got black and the lightning was so bright,” said Linda Wager, a 52-year-old from Pleasant Valley, N.Y. Wager, a former EMT, was watching a movie in her RV when an alert popped up on her phone. Wager’s family — including her 6-month-old grandson — and friends from North Carolina ran to a nearby bathhouse to take cover. But as she waited for a few moments, she wondered whether anything was going to happen. “I was hoping that it was something that we just had to be prepared about,” she said. “But once I saw the sky . . . I knew.” The tornado formed over the bay, producing a waterspout that moved onshore as a tornado, Rusnak said. “Generally it would get weaker when it hits land — but this was more unique,” Rusnak said. “It lasted longer and was stronger.” State police said the tornado entered the campground from the southwest shore, moved northwest through the campground, and then turned south and continued southeast through the remainder of the campground. According to a Northampton County news release, populated neighborhoods also were impacted. Wager said the tornado aimed directly over a pine forest section of campground where a tree fell on a tent and a camper unit “opened up like an unrolled tin can,” she said. “All their belongings were strewn all over the place,” Wager added. Maria Annunziata, an 18-year-old daughter of Wager’s friend from Apex, N.C., who also hid in a bathhouse, said the tornado didn’t seem real. “The campers were all upside down, and that’s when it hit me,” she said. The National Weather Service dispatched a storm survey team Thursday morning to assess damage, weather officials said. Authorities closed the campgrounds and were allowing groups of 20 to return to pack up. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said in a statement that Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran, Virginia Department of Emergency Management Coordinator Jeff Stern and regional state emergency management officials were also en route to the Eastern Shore. “We are all saddened by the reports of injuries and lives lost in this storm and will continue to offer our thoughts and prayers to the Virginia families who were affected, along with whatever support is necessary to help these communities move forward,” McAuliffe said in the statement.

When I entered the restaurant my girlfriend and I were immediately greeted by our server. This was the ONLY pleasant part of our experience. It took our server literally 10 minutes to show up with menus and ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered our pizza and it popped out 15 minutes later (which is fast, we're not complaining about that). We asked for two sides of ranch when the pizza came to the table and our waitress seemed very annoyed by our request. We did not start eating our pizza until the ranch arrived. So the pizza sat on our table for LITERALLY 20 minutes while waiting for TWO SIDES OF RANCH. When the ranch finally showed up, we both needed refills at this time, which also annoyed the waitress. We waited literally another 10 minutes to get refilled and finally got to eat our pizza. The pizza sat on the table for half an hour before the waitress could make two SMALL accommodations that would allow us to enjoy our meal. After finishing our meal, this server still didn't bring us our check for a good 20 minutes. No part of this experience was enjoyable and I will NEVER go back to an Angelina's.

Write an article based on this summary: – Health experts are calling for warning labels on booze, like those on tobacco products, based on a new study that finds alcohol is a direct cause of at least seven forms of cancer. Drink only a little? You're still at risk, scientists write in the journal Addiction. After reviewing 10 years' worth of data from agencies including the World Cancer Research Fund, researchers conclude drinking is a direct cause of not just liver cancer, but also cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, reports the Guardian. \\"The highest risks are associated with the heaviest drinking but a considerable burden is experienced by drinkers with low to moderate consumption,\\" says study author Jennie Connor. She tells the Telegraph there's actually no safe level of drinking in reference to cancer. As CNET puts it, \\"you booze, you lose.\\" Drinking 50 grams of alcohol per day—about 2.6 beers or roughly three 6-ounce glasses of wine—results in a four to seven times greater risk of cancer in the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, and a 1.5 times greater risk of the others, compared to consuming no alcohol at all, reports Live Science. Alcohol may also cause skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, says Connor, adding the purported benefits of alcohol are \\"seen increasingly as ... irrelevant in comparison to the increase in risk of a range of cancers.\\" Scientists aren't sure how alcohol causes cancer, but acetaldehyde—the compound formed when alcohol breaks down—damages the DNA of cells in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and liver. The good news: Those who stopped drinking reduced their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to fall the longer they steered clear of booze. (Good thing we're drinking less.)","completion":"Title: Health Experts Call for Warning Labels on Alcohol as New Study Links Its Consumption to Cancer Introduction Health experts are advocating for the implementation of warning labels on alcoholic beverages, similar to those found on tobacco products, due to a new study that has established a direct connection between alcohol consumption and at least seven forms of cancer. The study, published in the journal Addiction, cautions that even light drinkers are at a heightened risk. Findings After analyzing data from a 10-year span provided by organizations like the World Cancer Research Fund, researchers have concluded that alcohol consumption directly causes not only liver cancer, but also cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, as reported by the Guardian. Study author Jennie Connor notes that heavier drinkers face the highest risks, but even those with low to moderate consumption experience a significant burden. According to Connor, there is actually no safe level of alcohol consumption when considering the risk of cancer. As CNET puts it, \\"you booze, you lose.\\" Consuming 50 grams of alcohol per day (approximately 2.6 beers or about three 6-ounce glasses of wine) results in a four to seven times greater risk of cancer in the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus and a 1.5 times greater risk of the other cancers mentioned, compared to not consuming alcohol at all, as stated by Live Science. Connor also suggests that alcohol may cause skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the supposed benefits of alcohol consumption are now seen by experts as less relevant compared to the increased risk of developing various forms of cancer. Mechanism While scientists remain uncertain of the exact mechanism by which alcohol leads to cancer, one possible explanation is the damage caused by acetaldehyde, a compound formed when alcohol breaks down. Acetaldehyde damages the DNA of cells in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and liver. Silver Lining Fortunately, research has shown that individuals who quit drinking can reduce their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to decrease the longer they abstain from alcohol consumption. Conclusion As evidence of the direct link between alcohol and various forms of cancer continues to mount, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of the potential risks associated with drinking, regardless of the amount. The introduction of warning labels on alcoholic beverages could serve as a vital step in promoting public health and informing individuals about the potential dangers related to alcohol consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Current Supreme Court precedent, in Texas v. White, holds that the states cannot secede from the union by an act of the state. More recently, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stated, \`\`If there was any constitutional issue resolved by the Civil War, it is that there is no right to secede.'' Can we conclude that does texas still have the right to secede?","completion":"To address this question, let's go through the necessary steps to analyze the given context and determine whether Texas still has the right to secede. Step 1: Analyze the Texas v. White precedent Texas v. White is a Supreme Court case from 1869 that concluded that states cannot unilaterally secede from the United States. The Court ruled that the Constitution did not provide for the secession of states, and that any such attempt to secede would be considered void. This means that according to the precedent set by Texas v. White, Texas does not have the right to secede. Step 2: Consider Justice Antonin Scalia's statement Justice Scalia's statement reinforces the ruling in Texas v. White, emphasizing that the Civil War resolved any questions regarding the constitutionality of secession. His statement further supports the notion that there is no constitutional right for a state to secede from the union. Step 3: Evaluate any changes in legal or political context While it is important to recognize that the legal and political context may change over time, there has been no significant development, case law, or amendment to the Constitution that would indicate a shift in the Supreme Court's stance on secession since Texas v. White and Scalia's statement. Step 4: Check for any potential legal loopholes or exceptions It is also essential to consider whether there could be any legal loopholes or exceptions that might grant Texas the right to secede. However, based on the current legal framework and constitutional interpretation, no such loopholes or exceptions are apparent. Step 5: Conclusion Taking into account the precedent set by Texas v. White, the statement made by Justice Scalia, the lack of significant legal or political changes, and the absence of any identified legal loopholes or exceptions, we can conclude that, at present, Texas does not have the right to secede from the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones survived multiple feuds and have gone on to release 30 studio albums, 13 live albums and 109 singles. According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time, with their top single being \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", regarded by many at the time as \\"the classic example of rock and roll.\\" The Stones have also contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own \\"codewords\\" and slang, which they have used throughout their catalog of songs, including some of their more popular songs. The band has been viewed as the musical \\"vanguard of a major transfusion\\" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in both America and Britain. Muddy Waters was quoted as stating that the Rolling Stones and other English bands enhanced the interest of American youth into blues musicians; after they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums - and those of other blues musicians - increased with public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music. The Rolling Stones have sold over 240 million albums worldwide and have held over 48 tours of varying length. The Stones have also held three of the highest grossing tours of all time, Bridges to Babylon, Voodoo Lounge, and A Bigger Bang. In May 2013, Rolling Stone declared them the \\"most definitional band that rock & roll has produced,\\" with the Telegraph stating that Mick Jagger was \\"the Rolling Stone who changed music\\". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the \\"whole business model of popular music.\\" The band has received - and been nominated for - multiple awards during their 55 years as a band; including three Grammy awards (and 12 nominations), the Juno award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, U.K.'s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album Blue & Lonesome, and NME awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary Crossfire Hurricane.

Fighting in northern Mali has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced people, the human rights organization said. Many have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions or sexual violence, the report found. Since the beginning of 2012, the report found, Mali has faced a situation that has \\"questioned both the integrity of its territory as well as almost 20 years of political stability.\\" Fighters arriving from Libya in early 2012 fueled a Tuareg rebellion that included attacks against Malian outposts in the north of the country, the report said. The rebels are accused of violating international humanitarian law because they executed soldiers they caught in combat. According to Amnesty, the Malian army responded by bombing indiscriminately to civilian areas. Disaster looms for people of Mali as country is split by revolt. Adding to the country's woes, in March, a group of noncommissioned officers took power after a military coup. The new government suspended the constitution and arrested political leaders, Amnesty reported. While the military leaders sought legitimacy for their government, the armed groups took over northern Mali. \\"After two decades of relative stability and peace, Mali is now facing its worst crisis since independence in 1960,\\" Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's West Africa researcher, said in a statement. \\"The entire north of the country has been taken over by armed groups who are running riot. Tens of thousands of people have fled the region, creating a humanitarian crisis in Mali and in neighboring countries.\\" As of May, there were about 130,000 internally displaced people in Mali and an additional 190,000 who fled to neighboring countries as refugees, the report states.

Meanwhile, Malian security forces are accused of killing unarmed people. According to the organization, all parties in the conflict have committed human rights violations.","completion":"Amnesty International's new report highlights that the crisis in Mali, worsened by violence and displaced people, is the worst the country has faced in its recent history. The fighting in northern Mali has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, many of whom have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions, or sexual violence. The situation has challenged Mali's territorial integrity and political stability that lasted for almost 20 years. The crisis began in 2012, when armed fighters from Libya fueled a Tuareg rebellion which included attacks against Malian outposts in the north. The rebels have been accused of violating international humanitarian law by executing captured soldiers. The Malian army retaliated by indiscriminately bombing civilian areas. Adding to the turmoil, the country underwent a military coup, suspending the constitution and arresting political leaders. As armed groups took control of northern Mali, the country faced its worst crisis since gaining independence in 1960. Amnesty International's West Africa researcher, Gaetan Mootoo, stated that the entire northern region was overrun by armed groups, causing tens of thousands to flee and resulting in a humanitarian crisis within Mali and neighboring countries. By May, around 130,000 internally displaced people remained in Mali, with an additional 190,000 seeking refuge in neighboring nations.

We got back a few days ago , long enough for them to have my flat now resembling the boat . Right down to the holes in the wall .

The narrator appears to value their space and the cleanliness, and they seem to be experiencing discomfort due to the contrasting behavior of their guests. Firstly, the narrator's self-description as 'not a sociable person' suggests their introverted nature. Introverts usually prefer solitude and less stimulating environments, which is in stark contrast to the chaotic atmosphere created by their guests. Secondly, their guests' behavior and description as 'very loud' and 'never seem to sleep' emphasize the narrator's preference for quiet and calm surroundings. The disturbance caused by the guests' noise level and constant activity appears to be taking a toll on the introverted narrator. Lastly, by noting that the guest's stay has caused their flat to resemble the boat filled with holes in the wall, the narrator showcases their preference for orderliness and tidiness. The negative impact on their flat indicates their agitation and concern for maintaining their personal space. In conclusion, the narrator comes across as an introverted, private, and orderly person who is struggling to cope with the presence of their tall, loud, and disruptive guests.

What is the answer??","completion":"The equation you've given is: 238l - 249l + 77 = 0 The first step is to simplify the equation and solve for l. Subtract the term -249l from 238l: 238l - 249l = 11l. So your equation is now: -11l + 77 = 0 To solve for l, you need to isolate l. You can do this by first subtracting 77 from both sides of the equation to get: -11l = -77 Now, to get l on its own, divide both sides of the equation by -11: l = -77 / -11 Hence, l = 7 So the solution to the equation 238l - 249l + 77 = 0 is l = 7.

Answer the following question: This article: After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes. When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront.

Last few times I have ordered they either took a ridiculous amount of time to fill the order and deliver it (I literally live a block away), or they forget one of my items. I just ordered again, and wrote in the notes not to put any ice in my TWO pepsis that I ordered. I wanted to see if they actually read the notes. Well, my husband answers the door while I'm in the other room, and when I come out... sure enough they read the notes. No ice, but they only brought one drink. SO ANNOYING.

That's a good 30-60 a week you just lost from my orders. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? Choose from: +negative; +positive;","completion":"This review was clearly given negatively. The reasons for the negative evaluation are based on the consistently poor service experienced by the reviewer. Firstly, the reviewer criticized the food delivery time, which was claimed to be ridiculously long despite the close proximity between the reviewer's location and the restaurant. Secondly, they expressed discontentment about the oversight on the items ordered. This was repetitively mentioned, indicating a persistent problem and also showing lack of attention to detail or perhaps inefficient management on the restaurant's part. This could lead to dissatisfaction among patrons who count on home deliveries, especially when the missed items are something they paid for. Finally, the reviewer conducted a test to see if the restaurant pays heed to particular details or special instructions enclosed in the order - again a reference to the instructions about the Pepsi drinks served without ice. While the instruction was followed, the restaurant failed in delivering the correct number of drinks, thereby missing the mark again and consequently making the reviewer more annoyed. Furthermore, the review concludes with the disappointment felt by the reviewer and they even disclose they would have to find an alternative restaurant for Chinese food. The mention of the loss of frequent orders (to the amount of 30-60 per week) from this particular customer can be construed as a significant negative impact on the restaurant business from a customer's perspective. So, overall, the tone of the review, the issues raised, and the final decision of stopping to order from 'Golden Egg Roll', implies a negative review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Keep up your communication.","completion":"Title: \\"Spark, Connect, Communicate: A Guide to a Healthy and Pleasurable Friends with Benefits Relationship\\" Introduction Navigating the complex world of no-strings-attached relationships can be both exciting and challenging. Whether you've decided to embark on this unique connection due to a busy lifestyle, fear of commitment, or just the thrill of it, maintaining a healthy friends-with-benefits (FWB) relationship requires effective communication and trust. This article will guide you step-by-step through the process to ensure a positive experience for both you and your partner. Step 1: Flirt and Set the Mood Lay the foundation for your FWB relationship with some light-hearted flirting. This step is vital as it helps establish chemistry and shows mutual interest. Engage in playful banter, tease your partner, and build anticipation for what's to come. Be thoughtful in your approach, making it clear that you're interested in more than just platonic friendship, while also being respectful of boundaries and consent. Step 2: Make Your Move Once you've built a connection and feel there's mutual understanding, it's time to take things to the next level. Initiate physical touch by maintaining eye contact and giving subtle hints, like leaning in or brushing your hand against their arm. If the signals are well-received, gradually escalate the intimacy, moving from holding hands to kissing, and eventually, hooking up. Remember, consent is essential at every point, and it's crucial to make sure both parties are comfortable with the pace. Step 3: Set Ground Rules After the initial spark, outline the framework of your FWB arrangement, specifying the boundaries that make both of you comfortable. Discuss your expectations regarding exclusivity and commitment, and whether the relationship is strictly sexual or open to emotional involvement. These conversations can be difficult, but setting ground rules will prevent future misunderstandings and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for both of you. Step 4: Enjoy the Moments Now that the foundation is set, it's time to indulge in the fun part: the sex. Explore each other's desires, fantasies, and preferences in a consensual and non-judgmental environment. Be open to trying new things, but also respect your partner's boundaries and communicate any discomfort. Listen to your partner's body language and vocal cues to gauge their likes and dislikes. Step 5: Maintain Open Lines of Communication Communication is the cornerstone of any relationship, including FWB arrangements. Keep the conversation flowing, share your feelings, and address any concerns as they arise. By regularly checking in with your partner and recalibrating the expectations as needed, you'll ensure a positive and mutually enriching experience. If either partner decides to end the arrangement, or if feelings develop beyond the agreed-upon boundaries, prioritize honesty and respect as you sort out those emotions together. Conclusion A friends-with-benefits relationship can be a thrilling and fulfilling venture, provided both parties actively engage in clear communication and maintain mutual respect. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll be equipped with the necessary tools to forge a healthy, enjoyable FWB experience, leading to countless memorable moments and a strengthened connection with your partner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The last name \\"Filchner\\" is also German, and it is pronounced /fɪlχnɐr/. I'll use this pronunciation for transliteration as well. Now, I'll transliterate the name letter by letter to the corresponding Russian letters: Wilhelm Filchner 1.

Article: Having a child may improve a woman's memory, a new study suggests. In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said. Question: It can be inferred that Santiago believe the findings of the study _ . - may cause a heated discussion among parents - may cause an increase in the birth rate - are tested by previous similar studies - are encouraging news for mothers Answer:","completion":"It can be inferred that Santiago believes the findings of the study are encouraging news for mothers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce... Question: The author gives the example of Mr. Negroponte's cheap computers _ .

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: human tooth for the following movie plot: Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside.

If \\"A shirtless man in gray shirts is getting ready to hit a volleyball coming towards him while on a beach playing volleyball.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man is running around his house.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"The man is running around his house.\\" based on the initial statement, \\"A shirtless man in gray shorts is getting ready to hit a volleyball coming towards him while on a beach playing volleyball.\\" Let us analyze both statements for a better understanding: Statement 1: A shirtless man in gray shorts is getting ready to hit a volleyball coming towards him while on a beach playing volleyball. This statement describes a man who is not wearing a shirt and is wearing gray shorts. The setting is on a beach, where the man is engaged in a game of volleyball. The statement clearly conveys an outdoor scene where the man is actively participating in a sport. Statement 2: The man is running around his house. This statement depicts an entirely different scenario. It suggests that the man is now within the vicinity of his house and is involved in an activity, specifically running around the house. There is no mention of the beach or playing volleyball. In logical reasoning, one statement does not necessarily lead to another if there is no clear connection between the two. In this case, since the first statement is about a man playing volleyball on the beach, there is no logical basis for implying that the man is running around his house. In conclusion, there is no logical connection between the two statements, and thus the second statement \\"The man is running around his house.\\" does not logically follow from the first statement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If Investing Social Security surpluses in the stock market affects the government's asset holdings but does not directly increase national saving., can we conclude that \\"Most members of the public feel that increasing national saving is the more desirable outcome.\\"?","completion":"Alright buddy, imagine you have a piggy bank where you save your extra coins. Social Security is kind of like a big piggy bank for the country where people save money for when they're older. Sometimes, there is extra money in that big piggy bank, which is called a surplus. Now, the people who take care of that big piggy bank can decide to invest some of that extra money in the stock market, like buying small parts of different companies to get some extra profit. But investing this money doesn't mean people in the country will save more money - it's more about managing the extra money in the piggy bank. Some people think it's better to encourage everyone in the country to save more money, which is called \\"increasing national saving\\". But just because they invest the piggy bank's extra money in the stock market, we can't be sure that most people also want to increase national saving. Some people might want it, while others may have different opinions on what's best for the country.

The group itself had opposed the release of the collection, because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as Uncle Sam), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by Epic Records, not Motown. Boyz II Men's third studio album, Evolution, was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of II's (12 million copies) and Cooleyhighharmony (9 million). Only one of Evolution's singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned \\"Four Seasons of Loneliness\\", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed \\"A Song for Mama\\" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film Soul Food) was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up \\"Can't Let Her Go\\" underperformed. The global tour began in 1997 to promote Evolution was very successful in terms of ticket sales, but behind the scenes, Boyz II Men was wracked by conflicts with their record label and internal conflicts among the members of the group. Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group as well.

Article: Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines. Question: According to the writer, the artists love street art because _ .

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir.

Article: As a result of the confusion in Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, the Seleucid Empire also became entangled with the Romans. The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192–188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.

The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. and the situation: Keith was measuring the attributes of thermoclines. He selected two locations. One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house.

Write an article with the title: \\"Democrat Surges in Poll Ahead of N.Y. Special Election\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Democrat Surges in Poll Ahead of N.Y. Special Election [Step 1: Start with a brief introduction to the article topic] In a dramatic turn of events, the Democratic candidate for the upcoming special election in New York has made significant progress in the polls, pulling ahead of their rival in a contest that was once seen as a tight race. [Step 2: Explain the background/context of the special election] The special election, scheduled for November 3, 2021, was called to fill the vacant seat in New York's 4th Congressional District left by the resignation of the former representative earlier this year. The high-stakes race has attracted national attention and turned into a battleground for both parties, as it may have far-reaching impacts on the political landscape. [Step 3: Present data and figures to support the claim in the title] According to the latest poll conducted by XYZ Research Institute, the Democratic candidate, John Doe, has experienced a surge in support, leading the Republican candidate, Jane Smith, by 6 points, 48% to 42%. This marks a significant change from just two weeks ago when the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls, indicating a potential shift in voter sentiment. [Step 4: Provide possible reasons for the surge in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers] There are several factors that may have contributed to this upward trend in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers. First, John Doe received a series of high-profile endorsements from key political figures, helping boost his credibility among undecided voters. Secondly, the recent debates proved advantageous for the Democratic campaign, as John Doe was able to articulate clear policy plans, particularly on issues of healthcare and education, which resonated with voters in the district. [Step 5: Mention the Republican candidate's reaction to the updated poll results] In response to the new poll results, Jane Smith, the Republican candidate, has doubled down on her campaign efforts, focusing on a platform centered around economic recovery and job creation in the district. Her campaign has also initiated a series of attack ads aimed at questioning John Doe's qualifications and commitment to the district. [Step 6: Address the uncertainty and potential future developments in the race] While the latest poll numbers indicate a shift in favor of the Democratic candidate, the race remains tight and uncertain. In this highly polarized political climate, the outcome could be swayed by unforeseen events, such as a late-breaking scandal or a significant national development. Both campaigns will need to continuously adapt to the rapidly changing political landscape in order to secure a victory in the special election. [Step 7: Conclude the article by reiterating its potential implications] The result of the NY-4 special election could have far-reaching consequences for both parties at a national level. A win for the Democrats could provide momentum for their broader political agenda, while a Republican victory would signal strength in traditionally competitive districts. As November 3 approaches, all eyes will be on New York’s 4th Congressional District to see which party will ultimately prevail in this closely watched race."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain. What does soluble fiber do to help lower blood glucose levels?","completion":"Soluble fiber helps lower blood glucose levels by dissolving in water in the intestinal tract to form a gel-like substance. This gel formation slows down the movement of food through the intestines, which in turn slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. As a result, blood glucose levels rise at a steadier and more controlled pace, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. This can be particularly beneficial for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes, as it aids in better blood sugar management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

Black hair arguably is one of the quickest indicators of ethnicity, ethos and sometimes, politics. This past week, two very different children found their very different \\"ethnic\\" hairstyles in the spotlight on two very different political stages. Dante de Blasio, the son of New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, is a typical nerdy, smart, shy 16-year-old Brooklyn boy. He has delighted New Yorkers, late-night satirists and America with his charm and awesome afro. When the Big Apple's primary election was held, it garnered national attention at first largely because of the high-profile and high-drama candidate Anthony Weiner.

The correct answer is \\"Tiana Parker hit the TV news cycle, many people were heartbroken watching her\\" because it adds another character and reason for being in the spotlight related to the subject of ethnic hairstyles.

News article: Butlin's gives holiday chalets £16m Mumsnet makeover The early incarnations of the Butlin’s chalets, which welcomed their first holidaymakers the best part of a century ago, could hardly be described as luxurious. Certainly, they were homely and fun but there was no heating or an inside toilet, and running water was a bit of a bonus. Related: Butlin’s Minehead: resort-hotel review On a blustery spring day on the Somerset coast on Tuesday, the holiday company’s executives and its famous Redcoats (not to mention various stilt-walkers and Bonnie Bear), unveiled the 21st-century version of those wooden lodgings: pretty mini-homes with all mod cons, including wireless internet, flat-screen televisions and that epitome of modern living , L-shaped sofas. We're so excited to officially launch the new #ButlinsChalets at #Minehead! Stay tuned for updates from launch day! pic.twitter.com/V8vecalxn5 They were, argued managing director of Butlin’s, Dermot King, a “re-imagining” of the chalets that Sir Billy Butlin dreamed up in the interwar years. “We wanted to go back to what Butlin’s is good at and famous for,” he said. “Billy Butlin invented the chalet. We celebrate our 80th year next year and we couldn’t miss the opportunity to re-invent the chalet. What we’ve built is something that nods to the heritage he created but inside they are very different to the original ones.” A trip to the seaside to see Butlin's new chalets Here's the boss claiming the word chalet for the holiday company. http://t.co/f10L7EMjmi While he was about it, King was also claiming the word “chalet” for Butlin’s. “Chalet is a word that Butlin’s owns,” he said. “It’s generally connected to Butlin’s resorts. It’s only when you put the word Swiss in front of it that you get a different connotation.” The French-Swiss might argue about it, but it is inarguable that the new 117 chalets at the West Lakes Chalet Village on the company’s Minehead park are very different not only to those early versions but to the still-functioning ones in other parts of the resort. Butlin’s has spent £16m on the development, which is set in 6.9 hectares (17 acres) of landscaped gardens. Two-, three- and four-bedroom versions are available. Painted in pastel shades (like Butlin’s originals), they boast balconies and verandas and open plan living areas. The fairground and pavilion packed with all sorts of entertainments is a a short stroll away. The company also, cleverly, worked with the website Mumsnet to find out what mothers actually wanted from a chalet. After almost half said they did not want televisions in children’s bedrooms, Butlin’s left them out. Almost 60% said they were worried about bad weather wrecking family holidays – prompting the company to equip chalets with arts and crafts materials. They are also providing a library of board games designed to get families off tablets and smartphones and interacting with each other. The original Butlin’s chalets were conceived as an antithesis to the existing concept of a seaside holiday when people would arrive at the coast from towns and cities on charabancs and stay in guesthouses run by landladies whose inflexible rules meant guests were kicked out at breakfast time and not allowed back in except at meal or bedtimes. Butlin watched these holidaymakers trying to find shelter and entertainment in the rain and decided to offer them something that gave them more independence and dignity. The historian Kathryn Ferry, who specialises in the British seaside and holiday camps, said: “Billy Butlin had a talent for giving British holidaymakers what they wanted before they knew they wanted it. “The chalet was a key part of his vision because it gave people freedom. It seems obvious now but it was revolutionary in the 1930s and the things people expect on their holidays today really owe a lot to his vision all those years ago.” Butlin’s seems still to be on top of its game. It had 1.2 million stay at its resorts in Minehead, Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Skegness in Lincolnshire last year. Sales are up by 8% this year. Adrian Rogers, 48, from Dorset, was one of the first to sample the delights of the new chalets at Minehead. He was impressed. “I’ve been coming here since I was born and visit maybe five times a year,” he said. “But I’ve never seen anything like these chalets. They are great.” Butlin's regular Adrian Rogers on the company's swish new chalets. http://t.co/xzQjYjVjGD What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Given the question: Given the below context: Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by Sir John Baker. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Seven Years' War.

Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis. After reading the above, is \\"By nuclear reacations\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How does the liquid metal within the Earth's core generate a magnetic field?\\"?","completion":"Imagine you're playing with a big ball filled with gooey liquid that has tiny, shiny, magnetic toys (like little metal marbles) floating in it.

This is similar to how the Earth's core works! Now, back to your question about \\"nuclear reactions.\\" That's a bit different, like when you put together tiny building blocks called atoms and create energy. That's not how the Earth's core creates a magnetic field. So, \\"By nuclear reactions\\" is not the correct answer for how the liquid metal within the Earth's core generates a magnetic field.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which currency is represented by the ISO code EGP????","completion":"The currency represented by the ISO code EGP is the Egyptian Pound. The ISO 4217 is an international standard specifying three-letter codes for different currencies. EGP stands for Egyptian Pound, where \\"E\\" refers to Egypt, and \\"GP\\" refers to Pound. This helps in identifying and distinguishing the currencies globally. The Egyptian Pound is the official currency of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and it is managed by the Central Bank of Egypt. The Egyptian Pound has a long history, dating back to the early 19th century. During the time of British occupation in the early 1800s, the Egyptian Pound was linked to the British Pound Sterling. The Egyptian Pound was then pegged to gold and various currencies over the years, reflecting significant political, economic, and social changes. Currently, the Pound is a floating currency, meaning its value depends on market forces of supply and demand. The Egyptian Pound is further divided into 100 smaller units, known as \\"piastres\\" in English or \\"qirsh\\" in Arabic. However, because of inflation over the years, piastre coins are nowadays less frequently used in daily currency transactions. The Central Bank of Egypt issues the country's banknotes and coins in various denominations ranging from 1 to 200 Egyptian pounds for banknotes and 25 and 50 piastres, and 1 pound for coins. Egypt's economy has faced fluctuating trends in growth and inflation, which have impacted the value of its currency. Tourism, remittances from Egyptians working abroad, the Suez Canal, and agricultural exports are some of the critical sources of income for the Egyptian economy. Moreover, ongoing economic reforms, such as reducing energy subsidies and introducing a value-added tax (VAT), have helped stabilize the Egyptian economy in recent years. In conclusion, the ISO code EGP represents the Egyptian Pound, which is the official currency of the Arab Republic of Egypt. It plays an essential role in Egypt's economy and holds historical significance. The Central Bank of Egypt manages the issuance of banknotes and coins, and the exchange rate of EGP against other currencies is determined by market forces, reflecting Egypt's economic performance."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive.

Liverpool are prepared to pay an increase on the £10million fee they have agreed with Lille to accelerate Divock Origi’s release in January. The Belgium forward, whom Brendan Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in, they would be ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. Belgium's Divock Origi, second left, scores the second goal against Iceland on Wednesday night. Origi (right) celebrates with team-mates after his goal against Iceland at the King Baudouin stadium. Lille, however, have given no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant he would stay the full season in France, and hand Origi to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old has admitted he would be happy to move in January. ‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday. ‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January.

Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club.

Liverpool bought Origi from Lille for £10million but loaned him back to the French side for the season. ‘I would love to move to Liverpool sooner rather than later. I am here at Lille. It’s fine, they are a good club and they have helped me. But I can’t wait to be playing in the Premier League because I can now see that it will suit me better. I think there are good things waiting for me with Liverpool.’ Origi, who has scored five goals in France this season, played for Lille in both their Europa League matches against Everton recently. He has made a point of watching how Liverpool have fared and believes their current position in the Barclays Premier League does not reflect their capabilities. ‘I have been following Liverpool closely, the events of what has been going on and I think they have had a difficult time,’ said Origi. ‘They have a team with a lot of talent, with a lot of good players. They also have a very, very good coach. ‘But they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them. It is difficult when you do not have a player like Daniel Sturridge, for instance.

The limited time constraint may have been due to various reasons, such as busy schedules, early morning commitments, or even a simple desire to engage in other activities that night. Shorter games can be just as enjoyable, and sometimes even more engaging, than their lengthier counterparts.

Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the \\"single digit bracket\\" kids and don't expect a lot from this film. _X What is the sentiment of this review? Options are: 1). negative; 2). positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be best categorized as 1). negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment on several aspects of the movie. They cite being only mildly entertained, not finding the movie as fun as its predecessor, and notably criticizing the repetitive use of visual effects on the character Herbie, comparing it to R2D2 from Star Wars. While they note a few positive aspects, like the acting by Micheal Keaton and Matt Dillon, these points seem somewhat overshadowed by their overall dissatisfaction with the movie. They specifically advise going to see it with young children and tempering expectations, implying that it might not live up to the viewer's potential expectations for entertainment or cinematic quality. Therefore, the overall tone of the review is negative, citing more issues with the film than praises."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Question 2: \\"Is 'I've a' gramatically correct?\\" Available options: (1). no; (2). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Is this sentence grammatically correct? No, the sentence \\"Is 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" is not grammatically correct because it lacks proper punctuation and phrasing. A more appropriate way to ask the question would be: \\"Is the phrase 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" Question 2: \\"Is 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" Available options: (1). no; (2). yes; To answer question 2, we need to analyze the phrase \\"I've a\\" and discuss its grammatical correctness. \\"I've\\" is a contraction of \\"I have.\\" Contractions are formed by combining two words into one, where an apostrophe replaces the omitted letter(s). In this case, the letter 'h' and the space between the two words are replaced by an apostrophe. When the contraction \\"I've\\" (I have) is followed by a verb in the -ing form (e.g., \\"I've been running\\" or \\"I've finished\\"), it is grammatically correct. However, using \\"I've\\" before a noun (\\"I've a book\\" or \\"I've a car\\") may not sound standard, especially in American English. In British English, though, the construction \\"I've a\\" can sometimes be idiomatic and informal, especially in spoken English.

No, \\"I've a\\" is not grammatically correct in all instances. (2). Yes, \\"I've a\\" is grammatically correct in some instances, particularly in informal British English.

As for the final question, \\"Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?\\", the answer is no. While question 2 is asking specifically about the grammatical correctness of the phrase \\"I've a,\\" question 1 asks about the grammatical correctness of the sentence itself without specifying which sentence is being referred to.

Q: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 0, equation weights = [8, 6] A:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the polynomial equation. Usage: A polynomial equation is a sum of terms; each term is either a constant number or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number, called weights. Example: 2x^2 + 3x + 4. Here, the weights are 2, 3, and 4, and the equation is made up of three terms. Part #2: Representing a polynomial equation using weights. Usage: A polynomial equation can be represented using a list of its weights. Example: equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4. In this case, the list [6, 4] shows that the weights of x are 6 and 4, respectively, in a 1-degree polynomial equation. Part #3: Substituting a given value of x in the polynomial equation. Usage: Calculate the result of the polynomial expression by substituting a given value of x. Example: x = 0, equation weights = [8, 6] represent the equation 8x + 6. When x = 0, the result of the equation is 0*8 + 6 = 6. The computed result is 6. Part #4: Computing the result of a polynomial expression with different equation weights. Usage: Compute the result of a polynomial expression with a given value of x and given equation weights. Example: x = 0, equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. When x = 0, the result of the equation is 0*1 + 0*3 + 4 = 4. The computed result is 4."},{"prompt":"\\"They've got cameras everywhere, man.

In fact, many people never read a poem once they get out of high school. It is worth reminding ourselves that this has not always been the case in prefix = st1 /America. In the nine-tenth century, a usual American activity was to sit around the fireside in the evening and read poems aloud. It is true that there was no television at the time, nor movie theaters, nor World Wide Web, to provide _ However, poems were a source of pleasure, of self - education, of connection to other people or to the world beyond one ' s own community. Reading them was a social act as well as an individual one, and perhaps even more social than individual. Writing poems to share with friends and relations was, like reading poems by the fireside, another way in which poetry has a place in everyday life. How did things change? Why are most Americans no longer comfortable with poetry , and why do most people today think that a poem has nothing to tell them and that they can do well without poems? There are, I believe, three factors: poets, teachers, and we ourselves. Of these, the least important is the third: the world surrounding the poem has betrayed us more than we have betrayed the poem. Early in the twentieth century, poetry in English headed into directions unfavor-able to reading of poetry. Readers decided that poems were not for the fireside or the easy chair at night, and that they belonged where other difficult-to-read things belonged. Poets failed the reader, so did teachers.

Ask a question about Political philosophy.","completion":"Question: What is the role of social contract theory in contemporary political philosophy, and how did key philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contribute to the development of this theory? Answer: Social contract theory is a significant and influential aspect of contemporary political philosophy. It posits that the relationship between the governed and their government is based on an implicit or explicit agreement, referred to as the \\"social contract.\\" According to this political ideology, individuals agree to relinquish some personal autonomy and adhere to certain rules or norms to maintain a functioning society. The enforcement of these rules is then entrusted to a governing authority or political institutions. Social contract theory has significantly shaped Western political thought and has played a vital role in the development of modern liberal democracies. Three key philosophers – Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau – significantly contributed to the development and advancement of social contract theory. 1. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679): Hobbes' most famous work, \\"Leviathan,\\" was an early and influential example of social contract theory, published in 1651. His thoughts on the matter came in the wake of the English Civil War, which convinced him of the necessity of strong government to prevent societal discord. Hobbes argued that in a pre-governmental state, known as the \\"state of nature,\\" human life was \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\" In this anarchic state, people lived in constant fear and pursued self-preservation above all else. To remedy this situation, Hobbes claimed that individuals would willingly enter into a social contract, surrendering their individual rights and liberties to a sovereign authority. This absolute ruler, which Hobbes referred to as the Leviathan, would provide law and order, enforce social rules, and protect subjects from external threats. In return, subjects would obey the ruler and the system of laws set in place. For Hobbes, a strong and unified government, even if oppressive, was better than the chaos that reigned in the state of nature. 2. John Locke (1632-1704): Locke, often referred to as the father of liberalism, introduced a more optimistic view of human nature and the social contract in his \\"Two Treatises of Government,\\" published in 1689. Contrary to Hobbes, Locke believed that humans lived in relative peace and cooperation in the state of nature, possessing natural rights to life, liberty, and property. For Locke, the primary purpose of government was to protect these rights. Individuals would form a social contract by instituting a government and agreeing to follow its laws. However, rather than an omnipotent sovereign, power was to be entrusted to a parliamentary system with a clear separation of powers, ensuring that no single entity had absolute control. Importantly, Locke advocated for the right to revolution if a government failed to protect the people's rights or became tyrannical. 3. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): Rousseau introduced a more egalitarian perspective to the social contract theory in his influential 1762 work, \\"The Social Contract.\\" For Rousseau, individuals in the state of nature were equal and autonomous. He famously claimed that \\"man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\\" Therefore, humanity entered into a social contract not only to secure their rights and protection but also to overcome the constraints and inequalities imposed by society. Rousseau's vision of the social contract differed from his predecessors by emphasizing the collective or \\"general will\\" as the guiding principle of political legitimacy. He argued that laws should be established through direct democracy, giving each citizen an equal voice in legislation. To ensure that the general will prevailed, Rousseau envisioned a decentralized form of government, with power dispersed among smaller communities. While not entirely against a central government, Rousseau maintained that authority should be limited, serving only to coordinate the decisions made by local communities. In conclusion, social contract theory has played a crucial role in shaping contemporary political philosophy. Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, with their respective approaches and contributions, helped lay the foundation for today's modern liberal democracies by articulating the rationale behind the existence of government, its legitimacy, and the importance of individual rights and collective will for a more just society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The liver filters blood from the digestive tract - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the winter comes earlier this year happens, how will it affect more bile occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Although the perturbation of winter coming earlier than usual does not have a direct impact on the liver's ability to produce bile, it can have indirect effects on the human body, thereby influencing the liver's functioning and bile production. Let's explore this in more detail by examining the relationship between the liver's functions, seasonal changes and the possible effects. 1. General effects of winter on the body: Winter brings lower temperatures, less sunshine, and shorter days. These conditions can cause a reduction in physical activity and changes in mood, leading to increased stress levels. Stress, in turn, affects various bodily systems, and the liver is no exception. High stress can cause the liver to work harder, leading to an overproduction of bile or other processes being strained. 2. Effects on digestion and nutrition: Winter weather can impact our food choices and digestive patterns. People may consume more high-calorie and high-fat foods during the colder months, and the lack of sunlight can affect the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D, which is essential for numerous bodily functions. An increase in the consumption of high-fat foods puts additional pressure on the liver, as it has to produce more bile for digestion. With more bile being produced, the risk of bile-related issues like gallstones may increase. 3. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): The onset of winter can trigger a type of depression called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is linked to a drop in serotonin levels due to reduced exposure to sunlight. People suffering from SAD may experience changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and mood. These changes can lead to an increased consumption of comfort foods, which are often high in fat, again requiring the liver to produce more bile and possibly increasing the risk of bile-related issues. 4. Winter infections and illnesses: Winter is a prime time for infections and illnesses such as colds and flu. The immune system will be working overtime to protect the body, which could lead to inflammation and impact the normal functioning of organs, including the liver. If the liver is already working harder to produce more bile due to dietary changes, any additional inflammation or infection during winter can strain its functions further. 5. Adaptive response to cold temperatures: The human body, in an attempt to maintain a stable internal environment, might adapt to cold temperatures by increasing metabolic activity. In turn, this can increase the liver's workload, which may lead to an altered bile production rate. In conclusion, although the perturbation of winter arriving earlier than expected does not have a direct effect on the liver and bile production, various indirect effects may occur due to changes in the body's response to winter conditions. These indirect effects can impact the liver's ability to produce bile and may potentially lead to issues related to bile production and digestion. This relationship underlines the importance of paying close attention to one's diet, physical activity, and overall health during winter months to maintain optimal liver function and general well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Image copyright Texas Lawyer Image caption Judge George Gallagher A Texas appeals court has overturned a man's conviction after finding a judge had inappropriately electrified him in court, US media report. Terry Lee Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years. Judge George Gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through Morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions. The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court. Mr Morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly. The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one Tarrant County in Texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent. Mr Morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso heard. The appeals court ruled on 28 February that Mr Morris' shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the Texas Lawyer news website on Tuesday. He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial. During the case in which Mr Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual acts from a 15-year-old girl, Judge Gallagher asked him to enter his plea of \\"guilty or not guilty\\". When Mr Morris responded by saying he had a lawsuit against Judge Gallagher and his defence lawyer, the judge warned him that he would shock him if he did not \\"follow the rules\\", the Washington Post newspaper reported, citing court transcripts. Mr Morris asked the judge to recuse himself because of the lawsuit when the judge directed the bailiff to shock him. The judge ordered the defendant to be shocked two more times as Mr Morris told the court he had a history of mental illness and complained that he was being \\"tortured\\". Mr Morris's attorney, Bill Ray, told the Texas Lawyer that he did not object to the use of the stun belt because his client was acting \\"like a loaded cannon ready to go off\\", and that he did not really believe that he was being shocked. The appeals court said the order clarifies that no Texas judges are allowed to shock defendants for refusing to follow the court's rules of decorum. \\"Never before have we seen any behaviour like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behaviour again,\\" wrote appeals court Justice Yvonne Rodriguez. \\"We must speak out against it, lest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\\" More on stun weapons ||||| State District Judge George Gallagher of Tarrant County told a bailiff on three occasions to punish an uncooperative defendant with electric shocks, and now the sex offender's conviction has been overturned and a new trial ordered. Stun belts can be strapped around the legs of some defendants and used to deliver thousands of volts of electric shock in the instance a defendant turns violent or attempts to escape the courtroom. However, in the case of Terry Lee Morris, who was convicted in 2014 of charges of soliciting sexual performance from a 15-year-old girl, an appeals court found that Gallagher used electric shocks as punishment after Morris failed to answer the judge's questions properly. Gallagher, the District 396 judge since 2000, declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman with the Tarrant County district attorney's office. After enduring the 50,000-volt shocks, Morris was apparently too scared to return to the courtroom and actually did not attend the remainder of his own trial. He appealed his conviction, alleging Gallagher violated his constitutional rights by repeatedly shocking him for failing to answer questions while showing no signs of becoming violent or being a flight risk. CYBER MONDAY SALE! Only 20 for a full year of digital access! Hurry! Offer ends Monday! SUBSCRIBE NOW The Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso handed down its ruling on Feb. 28. Texas Lawyer first reported the ruling Tuesday. The ruling said judges are not permitted to shock defendants who won't answer questions or don't follow the court's rules of decorum. “While the trial court’s frustration with an obstreperous defendant is understandable, the judge’s disproportionate response is not. We do not believe that trial judges can use stun belts to enforce decorum,” Justice Yvonne T. Rodriguez said of Gallagher’s actions in the court’s opinion. “A stun belt is a device meant to ensure physical safety; it is not an operant conditioning collar meant to punish a defendant until he obeys a judge’s whim. This Court cannot sit idly by and say nothing when a judge turns a court of law into a Skinner Box, electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes,\\" Rodriguez wrote. Morris, 54, remains in the Wynne Unit in Huntsville. Besides the conviction that was overturned, he was convicted in 1992 of causing bodily injury to a child and sentenced to 12 years to prison. His attorney at the 2014 trial, Billy Ray, told the Star-Telegram that he was \\"scared to death of what Morris might do. I was scared of the way he was acting. \\"But I felt kind of sorry for Morris,\\" Ray said. \\"I was trying to defuse Morris instead of telling the judge what to do. I felt that if I could have gotten Morris calmed down we could get through this thing.\\" Morris had filed a lawsuit against Ray and wanted him to recuse himself as his attorney. \\"Morris appeared to hate me but I think really he hated the situation more,\\" Ray said. \\"But you can't leave a defendant just because you believe he hates you; that's not the way it works. I was his second or third lawyer.\\" SHARE COPY LINK In this body camera footage, a group of correctional officers at the Muscogee County Jail in Muscogee, Ga. are seen handcuffing inmate Cortney Jackson after using a Taser and physical force to bring him to the ground.

When Gallagher asked Morris for his plea, guilty or not guilty. Morris refused to answer the question. “Sir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,” Morris responded, according to the appeals court. Morris told the judge he had a pending lawsuit against his defense attorney. Gallagher became irritated and warned Morris about further \\"outbursts.\\" \\"Mr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,” Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. “You will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen: No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.” Morris answered, \\"All right, sir.\\" When Morris continued to talk, Gallagher instructed the bailiff to activate the stun belts around Morris' legs. Gallagher asked Morris twice more if he was going to follow the rules. When Morris did not provide a plea, Gallagher said to the bailiff, \\"Hit him,\\" according to the appeals court ruling. The bailiff pressed the button that was to send the electric shock through Morris' body. Gallagher asked him again if he was going to comply. Morris told him he had a history of mental illness. Gallagher ordered another shock. \\"Hit him again,\\" Gallagher said. When Morris contended he was being \\"tortured\\" for seeking a recusal, Gallagher, according to the appeals court, ordered the bailiff to do it again: \\"Would you hit him again?\\" The appeals court said that 50,000 volts can have cognitive impairment effects on a defendant.

I know it says he was getting electrocuted, but they didn’t shock him.” Ray said Morris was behaving like a “loaded cannon ready to go off.\\" He told the Star-Telegram that he said he was afraid that Morris \\"would do something that might have gotten him hurt a lot worse. \\"And Judge Gallagher is not the kind of person who is mean to people,\\" Ray said. However, El Paso's Eighth Court of Appeals ruled that Gallagher shocked Morris as punishment and not for security reasons. “Never before have we seen behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,” Rodriguez wrote. “As the circumstances of this case perfectly illustrate, the potential for abuse in the absence of an explicit prohibition on non-security use of stun belts exists and must be deterred.” Gallagher later stated for the record that he was concerned by Morris' agitation and movements, suggesting he was within reach of a 200-pound wall-mounted courtroom video monitor that he could have pulled off and used to injure attorneys in the courtroom. \\"It was based on the totality of his continuing escalation and his movements that the court ordered the shock belt be initiated,\\" Gallagher said at the time, according to Texas Lawyer. \\"It was done for the safety of the lawyers and all of the participants.\\" SHARE COPY LINK Dash cam footage released by the Irving Police Department shows Kenneth Roblez, 38, attempt to avoid being pulled over by an officer.

Question: Where is tin stored forever? - shopping bag - hardware store - landfill - junk yard - antique store The best answer is Answer:","completion":"Tin, a chemical element with the symbol Sn, is a versatile and useful material commonly used for various purposes, such as in the production of cans, electronic components, and as a component in alloys like bronze and pewter. The question of where tin is stored forever is a complex one, as it depends on factors such as its form, use and disposal, and societal practices. The options provided - shopping bag, hardware store, landfill, junk yard, and antique store - represent different contexts in which tin might be found or stored. Let's explore each of these options in detail to determine the best answer. 1. Shopping bag: A shopping bag is a temporary storage option that will likely not store tin \\"forever.\\" Tin products may be contained in a shopping bag during transportation from a retail outlet to a consumer's home or workplace. However, once the consumer puts the tin item to use, the bag no longer serves as a storage place for tin, rendering this option not suitable. 2. Hardware store: A hardware store is another temporary storage location for tin. Hardware stores stock various tin products, such as tin sheets, foils, and tin-based solders. While these stores store tin for a certain period until it is purchased and used by consumers, they cannot be considered as a \\"forever\\" storage option. 3. Landfill: Landfills are the final destination for many waste materials, including tin. When tin products reach the end of their useful life and are discarded as waste, they may end up in landfills. Over time, tin exposed to air and moisture can corrode and disintegrate, releasing tin ions into the environment that can eventually become part of the soil. This natural process makes landfill a feasible option for tin to be stored \\"forever,\\" although it is not an ideal solution due to potential environmental consequences. 4. Junk yard: Similar to landfills, junk yards serve as a final resting place for innumerable discarded objects made of various materials, including tin. Although tin products may be found in junk yards as waste, the permanence of their storage there is uncertain. Junk yards often sort and process materials for recycling or disposal, which may include tin. So, while tin can be stored in junk yards for extended periods, it is not a \\"forever\\" storage solution. 5. Antique store: Antique stores can preserve and store tin items in the form of vintage or historical artifacts, such as tin toys, cans, and decorative objects. Although these tin items are stored and preserved for a long time, the concept of \\"forever\\" might not apply, as these objects may eventually be sold, exchanged, or passed on to other collectors. In summary, out of the provided options, the landfill seems to be the most plausible answer for where tin might potentially be stored \\"forever.\\" However, it is important to note that none of these options represent an ideal or permanent storage solution for tin, highlighting the necessity to develop sustainable practices for tin use, recycling, and disposal. Integrating recycling processes into waste management systems can help reduce the amount of tin being sent to landfills, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Wisconsin Democrats won President Obama’s attention and inspired other states by bolting the capital to protest a crackdown on unions. David Graham on the history of the political walkout. You can’t win a vote when you’ve got fewer votes than your opponents. But Wisconsin Democrats are discovering a centuries-old corollary truth this week: you can’t lose a vote if you don’t let it happen. And that’s why 14 of them have fled out of Madison and across the border into Illinois, hoping to prevent a vote that would cut benefits for public-sector workers and curtail the right to collective bargaining. As hundreds of protestors demonstrated against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's budget proposal, the Senate chamber in Madison remained quiet on February 17. (Photo: Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / MCT / Landov) It’s really just another tool in the minority toolbox—a sibling to the stalling tactic of proposing amendments and a cousin to that peculiar U.S. Senate obstructionist tradition, the filibuster. It carries distinct risks, since legislators who try it are literally running away from their jobs. But it can also be an effective way to buy time, since state police can’t drag legislators over state lines where they don’t have jurisdiction. And the example being set in Wisconsin could well stir copycats across the country, as budget battles grow ever more heated. In Ohio and Indiana, similar benefit battles loom, and both sides are watching their counterparts in Wisconsin to figure out what tactics work. “It’s odd that it doesn’t happen more often,” says Sarah Binder, a senior fellow and Congressional expert at the Brookings Institution. The situation in Wisconsin may be atypical—“This may be somewhat unusual, getting the president of the United States to weigh in on a legislative matter,” she says—and it might not gain additional votes. But it is a way for Democrats to influence the public mood and perhaps persuade Gov. Scott Walker and state Senate Republicans to tone down the bill. “Expanding the scope of conflict makes it much harder for Republicans to keep control of the story,” Binder says. While the temptation to follow Wisconsin’s lead may be growing, the list of notable uses of quorum-breaking in American history is still rather short. A look at some of the highlights: 1. Thomas Burke’s Departure As long as Americans have had legislatures, they’ve had disagreements and desperate minorities. In 1778, the Continental Congress was considering a critical letter to Gen. George Washington. Thomas Burke, a delegate from North Carolina, opposed the missive and stalked out of the congress, garnering him much abuse from his frustrated—but ultimately powerless—colleagues. North Carolinians, however, rallied around Burke because he justified his move by declaring that his allegiance was to his state and would not be weakened by unreasonable moves of a tyrannical central government. A dozen legislators hid out in a tiny apartment, using coded telephone signals as Texas Rangers fanned across the state to find them. 2. Abraham Lincoln’s Acrobatics Before Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and a staid statesman, he was a Whig and a rabble-rouser. Fighting a Democratic bill in Springfield to make payments only in gold or silver rather than paper money, Lincoln led Whigs to walk out and head off a quorum, as Karl Kurtz of the National Council of State Legislatures recalls. It worked one day, but the following day, Democrats were able to get back on track when Lincoln and a colleague entered the chamber to make the required motion for a quorum call. By the time the Whigs realized the trick, they were locked in. An attempt to dive out the window succeeded only in making them laughingstocks, and the bill passed. 3. “The Disappearing Quorum” Late in the 1800s, the U.S. House had become a hotbed of obstruction, much to the chagrin of Speaker Thomas Reed, an Ohio Republican, who set out to reform the rules. One favorite tactic was for representatives to come to the chamber but refuse to answer a roll call. Finally, in 1890, a furious Reed announced that if the clerk could see a member—rather than just hear his response—he would be counted toward a quorum. “Members started diving under their desks and running for the cloakrooms and stuff” to avoid being counted, says Senate historian Donald Ritchie. Despite heated objections, Reed’s reform stuck, and the House minority lost a valuable tool. 4. Texas’ Killer Bees Texas requires a two-thirds majority for a quorum, making mischief an especially attractive prospect there. In 1979, 12 liberal Democrats had already been nicknamed the “Killer Bees” for frequently blocking legislation. Their greatest moment came when they decided to flee to stop a bill to change the date of the state’s primary. The dozen hid out in a tiny apartment, using coded telephone signals as Texas Rangers fanned across the state to find them. Although one senator left and was captured, the others held out long enough to force the lieutenant governor to drop the proposal. 5. Bob Packwood vs. the Sergeant at Arms In the midst of a filibuster showdown in 1988, Republicans irked Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd by refusing to come to the floor. But Byrd, the legendary master of parliamentary tactics, was the wrong man to cross: he dug out an obscure rule that allowed him to call all members to the chamber at 12:30 a.m. under penalty of arrest by the Sergeant at Arms. Some members literally ran away; another, Oregon’s Bob Packwood, injured his arm while trying to barricade himself in his office. Packwood was eventually convinced to come to the Senate, but he insisted that they carry him across the threshold. 6. The Texas Eleven During a fight over redistricting, Democratic members of the state house and senate learned the lessons of the Killer Bees—and fled the Lone Star State altogether. A Republican plan, which Democrats derided as gerrymandering, would have eliminated five Democratic seats in Congress. It started in May 2003, when 51 House Democrats skipped town and went to Oklahoma, killing the plan. Republicans tried again later in the session, and 11 Democratic senators headed to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Speaking with Newsweek on Friday, Senator Mario Gallegos recalled a James Bond-like scenario. Senators had a plan in the event they had to flee, and kept bags packed in their offices. After a signal from their leader, all 11 met at a rendezvous point, where they were hustled into Chevy Suburbans and taken to the Austin airport to board two private planes—still unaware where they were going. Once in the air, they learned they were headed to Albuquerque, despite an order from the ground to return to Austin. “Obviously we told the pilots not to,” Gallegos says. “I said, ‘Oh hell, are we going to have two fighter jets force us to go back to Austin?’” The “Texas Eleven” held out for 46 days until Sen. John Whitmire decided he’d had enough and returned to Austin, making a quorum possible. What lessons can the runaways offer their counterparts in Wisconsin on their third day away? Gallegos says he doesn’t regret his 2003 run even though it ultimately failed, and he offered some moral support to the Wisconsin delegation. “If they feel strong about their position, they need to stay right where they’re at,” he says. “If they feel they’re representing our district, they need to stay right where they’re at.” But Gallegos’ colleague Juan Hinojosa, another member of the Texas Eleven, spoke of a wearying ordeal and was a bit warier. “You’ve got to compromise while you’re out of state,” he says. “Keep the lines of communication open.” David Graham is a reporter for Newsweek covering politics, national affairs, and business.

Walker and the GOP take language out of the budget repair bill that dilutes union rights. Which do you think is more likely to happen first? Madison — As protests at the state Capitol entered their second week, Republicans and Democrats on Sunday were holding possible bargaining chips in their efforts to end the political standoff that has held up action on Gov. Scott Walker's budget repair bill. If Democrats in the state Senate stay out of Wisconsin until Friday, they could undermine a key provision of Walker's plan to fix the state budget and take away most of public workers' union rights. Without this refinancing element, the state would have to take other steps such as cuts to health care programs to keep its budget balanced this year. Walker and other leading Republicans are holding firm despite the deadline. Meanwhile, Republicans who control the state Senate sought Sunday to put pressure on the Democrats in Illinois with their own leverage point: by planning action on a \\"full calendar\\" of undisclosed bills for Tuesday, said Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau). Without Democrats present, the Republicans have enough members to be able to hold votes on nonfinancial bills, such as confirmation of Walker cabinet appointments, but not on a budget bill. \\"The work of the Senate is not going to be held hostage just because the minority refuses to show up and do their jobs,\\" Welhouse said. Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona) declined Sunday to say how long Democrats would stay in Illinois, where they have been holed up since Thursday to prevent the Senate from having enough lawmakers on the floor to vote on Walker's bill. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said he believed he and other senators were willing to stay away until Friday or even longer if necessary. \\"A true leader wouldn't force people into this situation, and the governor needs to learn his lesson,\\" Miller said. With snow and cold rain falling on Madison Sunday, the crowd of demonstrators at the Capitol shrank from the massive levels of last week. But union supporters still turned out a sizable demonstration by normal statehouse standards, filling the rotunda with their numbers and chants. After districts in Madison and Milwaukee canceled classes last week because of teachers not showing up for work, Mary Bell, the president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said Sunday that teachers should report back to their schools. If teachers are off Monday, which is Presidents Day, Bell said they should come to Madison to keep up the demonstrations against Walker's bill. \\"It's time for educators to be back in the classroom with the students,\\" Bell told reporters in a teleconference. Milwaukee Public Schools and Madison's public schools will be closed on Monday, but officials at both districts said they expected to reopen on Tuesday. Miller said Democrats would quickly return if the governor and Republicans who control the Legislature would agree to take out the provisions on union rights. He said Republicans should agree to that because Democrats and public worker unions are willing to accept economic concessions in the bill that amount to roughly an 8% pay cut for an average state employee with family health coverage. But Walker stuck with his proposal Sunday. The governor said that the budget repair bill's cuts to public worker benefits and its repeal of union rights were both necessary to avoid the layoffs of 10,000 to 12,000 state and local employees. \\"This is about balancing not only our next budget but the budgets two, four, six years into the future,\\" Walker told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" Walker said he believed Wisconsin was helping lead the nation in efforts - also under way in other states - to change the way state and local governments deal with their unions. \\"We're willing to take this as long as it takes,\\" he said. Besides the union bargaining provisions, the bill includes many other elements, including a refinancing of state debt that Walker wants to shore up the state's finances through the fiscal year that ends June 30. That would push back 165 million in principal payments on the bonds into future years and free up money that could be used to help the state pay two large outstanding bills - one owed to the state of Minnesota and another owed to a fund for medical malpractice victims. The Legislature's nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said Walker's bill, as amended by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee last week, would leave the state with just 65 million in reserves. So without the money from the refinancing, the state would have a further projected shortfall of roughly 100 million to make up. To allow time for that refinancing deal to go through, the bill must pass by Friday, according to a memo earlier this month by state Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. More recently, Huebsch said it may be possible to pull off the bond deal if the bill passes by Saturday, but no later than that. \\"If we can't pass this by then, we lose our window for refinancing in this (fiscal year),\\" he said. If a deal can't be done, employee layoffs and cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, elderly and disabled, may be necessary, he said. GOP lawmakers are standing firmly with Walker. Rep. Robin Vos (R-Rochester), co-chairman of the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, noted Republicans did not leave Wisconsin in 2009 when Democrats controlled the Legislature and governor's office and passed a series of bills that were anathema to Republicans. \\"If this is a new standard where you can say, 'We can extort the majority,' then they have set up a permanent state of chaos in this state,\\" Vos said. On Sunday at the Capitol, union supporters clapped and chanted, \\"Kill the bill with kindness.\\" No incidents or arrests were reported, said Lt. Mary Ricksecker of the Madison police. The bill would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs - typically 5.8% of pay for state workers - and in many cases at least 12% of their health care costs. Union leaders have said they are willing to accept those concessions, which total nearly 330 million through June 2013. Under the bill, the unions could not bargain over anything but wages, would have to hold annual elections to keep their organizations intact and would lose the ability to have union dues deducted from state paychecks. Employees would no longer have to automatically pay union dues, but could choose whether they want to do so. It is those union changes that Democrats and public workers are demanding to be stripped from the bill. The changes affect most local, school and state employees, but police, firefighters and state troopers are exempt. Republicans control the Senate 19-14, but 20 senators must be present to pass bills with budget ramifications. That gives Democrats the ability to stop action, provided they all stick together. Senators are using personal funds, not state funds, to pay their expenses while they're in Illinois, Miller and Erpenbach said. They said senators were taking their salaries because they believed they were doing their jobs by standing up for workers' rights. The departure of the Senate Democrats recalls the 2003 stand-off in Texas in which Democratic senators went to New Mexico to block the adoption of a new map of legislative districts. That incident lasted a month, and ended when one of the 11 senators defected from the group. *** What happens next Monday: A hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. in Dane County Circuit Court on a request by the Madison Metropolitan School District to force teachers to return to school. A judge on Friday refused to issue a temporary order on that request. Monday: Noon and 5 p.m. rallies by labor and other groups at the state Capitol with musical performances from several artists, including Tom Morello, guitarist formerly of Rage Against the Machine. Tuesday: 10 a.m. Assembly session on budget repair bill scheduled. Noon labor rally at the Capitol. Senate session also expected on undisclosed bills but not budget repair proposal. Don Walker of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. ||||| The Democratic Wisconsin state senators camped out across the border in Illinois fired back at Gov. Scott Walker today, saying their action to block a vote on his budget proposal is an effort to protect democracy. Walker, whose budget bill sparked six straight days of protests at the capitol in Madison, today criticized the 14 Democrats, whose absence has prevented the state Senate from achieving the quorum necessary for a vote on the proposal. \\"If you want to participate in democracy, you've got to be in the arena, and the arena is right here in Madison, Wisconsin,\\" Walker said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"Democracy is not about hiding out in another state,\\" he said. \\"It's about showing up here in the capital and making the case there.\\" State Sen. Julie Lassa, who is six months pregnant, said the governor is wrong about her and the others holed up in an Illinois hotel. \\"For all of us who left the state, we believe we're standing up for democracy,\\" Nissa told ABC News' Barbara Pinto. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting Walker's proposal, which would cut benefits for public employees and drastically reduce unions' collective bargaining powers, have paralyzed the state capitol and the protesters said they aren't going anywhere. \\"I know that the people here are not going home people are going to be here until he is gone,\\" protester Miles Kristan said. Walker, though, was just as firm today in his resolve. \\"We're willing to take this as long as it takes, because, in the end, we're doing the right thing,\\" he said. \\"We're doing the right thing for Wisconsin.\\" He said the Democratic state senators who fled the state have \\"failed to do their jobs,\\" and he expects them to concede this week. \\"My hope is that cooler minds will prevail and by some time earlier this coming week they'll show up for their job,\\" Walker said. Instead, some 70,000 demonstrators showed up at the Capitol Saturday and a similar number today. Though most of them opposed Walker's budget proposal, which critics say is an effort at union busting, there were many backers of the bill as well this weekend. In addition to the demonstration in Madison, a smaller pro-union rally also was held today in Green Bay, outside Packers Stadium. Some tea party groups said Saturday they are forming exploratory committees to recall two of the Democrats who fled the state Thursday to protest the vote on the bill. The tea party group Northwood Patriots said it would meet today to discuss the recall of state Senator Jim Holperin, while a separate group in Kenosha, called the Robert Wirch Exploratory Committee said it is looking into recalling state Senator Robert Wirch. According to Madison's The Capital Times, a recall effort would require the exploratory committees to collect 15,000 to 20,000 petition signatures. Walker told reporters Friday that he would not \\"allow protesters to drown out the voice of the taxpayers,\\" adding that he had received 19,000 supportive e-mails this week and that a \\"quiet majority\\" of the state's residents are behind his plan. Walker, who unveiled the budget bill last Saturday, has been calling upon the Democrats to return and end their \\"theatrics.\\" \\"The bottom line is we're broke,\\" the governor said. \\"We can't negotiate for something we don't have the ability to give on.\\" Walker, faced with a 3.6 billion deficit, denied he is trying to bust the unions. Wisconsin has a 137 million shortfall this year and 3.6 billion over the next two years. Other governors facing similar budget crises are watching Wisconsin carefully. More than 40 states are facing a combined projected shortfall of 125 billion for the fiscal year of 2012. The hardest hit are California, facing a 25.5 billion gap, Texas at 13 billion, Illinois at 15 billion, New York at 9 billion and New Jersey at 10.5 billion. ABC News' Chris Bury and Olivia Katrandjian contributed to this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article talks about how the Wisconsin Democrats don't like the new rules about unions and how it affects workers.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research.

Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Here is an article: David Moyes has dismissed suggestions that Robin van Persie is unhappy at Manchester United and says the striker has a good chance of returning for Saturday's game against Stoke. Van Persie was rested for the midweek Champions League victory over Real Sociedad and it was claimed in the Netherlands that supposed injuries to toes and groin were a cover for dissatisfaction in training. \\"That's complete nonsense,\\" the Manchester United manager said. \\"He has been playing with injections in his toes, he played one game for Holland with injections and we wanted to get away from that and give him a proper rest.

An inability to extend their lead beyond a single goal ended up costing them points when Southampton produced a late equaliser in the last league match and the story could have been the same against Sociedad when United were indebted to an own goal for the margin of victory, despite creating a hatful of chances. \\"At least we are creating chances, you can't say we are not going for it,\\" Moyes said. \\"It is a concern because we should have been out of sight against Sociedad. We've been hitting the post and bar and I've no doubt that somewhere along the line it will go for us and the goals will go in but at the same time we do need to be more clinical. You can do as much finishing practice as you want, recreate situations on the training ground and so on but the important thing is to do the job on Saturday afternoon. I would have taken the win in Europe no matter what because the points were important but we could have made our lives much easier with a couple more goals.\\" With only one taken from the last couple of home games, Premier League points are becoming a matter of concern as well, although Moyes takes the long view. \\"Only two months of the season have gone, I think there will be other teams slipping up before the end,\\" he said. \\"We just have to make sure we don't slip up as often.\\" Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"David Moyes Dismisses Rumors of Van Persie's Unhappiness, Striker Likely to Return Against Stoke\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What name does the Major call the actor by? is inside the article: A few months before the D-Day landings during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than Normandy. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson, is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information. This happens quickly and their aeroplane is (unsuccessfully) attacked on leaving Gibraltar., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The Major calls the actor \\"Jimmy\\" in this story. The actor he refers to is M. E. Clifton James, a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps, who was also a professional actor in peacetime. Major Harvey comes across James while watching a theatre performance in London, where James convincingly impersonates General Bernard Montgomery. This leads to the operation in which James, nicknamed \\"Jimmy\\" by Major Harvey, impersonates Montgomery in North Africa as part of a disinformation campaign prior to the D-Day landings during the Second World War."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The primary objective of the European Central Bank, as laid down in Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone. The Governing Council in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%” and added that price stability ”was to be maintained over the medium term”. (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) Unlike for example the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective but this objective has never been defined in statutory law, and the HICP target can be termed ad-hoc. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where is the primary mission of the European Central Bank listed?","completion":"The primary mission of the European Central Bank (ECB) is listed in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). More specifically, it can be found in Article 127(1) of the treaty. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is one of two primary Treaties that form the constitutional basis of the European Union, the other being the Treaty on European Union. The TFEU outlines the roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures of the various institutions and decision-making bodies within the EU. It includes a wide variety of topics, ranging from agriculture and fisheries to transport and health. Returning to the subject of the European Central Bank, its primary mission, as stated in Article 127(1) of the TFEU, is maintaining price stability within the Eurozone. This means that the ECB aims to control inflation and prevent significant price fluctuations that could negatively impact the economy. In October 1998, the Governing Council further defined this objective of price stability, stating that they view it as keeping the inflation rate of the Euro area below but close to 2%, measured by the year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is an indicator of inflation and price stability in the Eurozone. It is a consumer price index that has been standardized across all member countries of the European Union in order to provide a comparable measure of inflation. Therefore, the ECB's primary mission is not simply declared in their statutes or laws, but is reflected in their continual efforts to maintain a stable price level in the Eurozone over the medium term by managing inflation rates. This price stability contributes to a stable economic environment, which is essential for sustainable economic growth and welfare in the Euro area. Unlike other central banks, such as the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective, focusing solely on price stability, with no formal statutory definition or quantified target beyond the ad-hoc HICP target."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask her about her siblings or other little things. For example, \\"How are Jimmy and Sarah doing?\\" or, \\"That blue shirt brings out your eyes.\\" Girls like it when you remember little things. Find out things you have in common, like a favorite band or sport. That will give you a common subject to talk about. If you go to school together, walk up to her in the halls and say hello after you've talked in class a couple times. You will make a good impression if you do nice things, like holding a door for her to go through or tying her shoe if you notice it has come undone. Do not go out of your way to do these things all the time. She will think it is weird instead of sweet. Many guys prefer to cut to the chase, but if she is worth asking out, it is worth building a friendship. If you ask her out without getting to know her first, she might turn you down just because she doesn't know enough about you to say yes. Text or chat with her for long periods of time. Girls love it when this happens. After you've texted her for a while and you think she's good enough friends with you, try to ask her who she likes. Make sure she asks you too, otherwise it will most likely end up being a different guy. Also try to make it late—that's extra cute! Do you have common interests? Are you around the same age? If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone. Try talking about what motivates her; by doing so, you will create a bond between you two. Ask her and some of your other friends if they would like to go somewhere such as the mall or movies. Eventually if you two are comfortable with each other you could ask her to hang out at your house with a group of people. A group of people will make it seem less awkward. Don't ask her specifically to something and build it up. Instead, arrange something with a group of friends and say she is welcome to come along. That way, if she can't make it, no harm done and you can recover from the rejection without problems. When inviting her out, it has to be something fun that isn't a big deal for her to join in on. You want to avoid the awkward staring at your hands/feet mumbling about \\"what she is up to that weekend\\". If she is already dating someone, then that is her business, and you need to respect it. If she's obviously interested in someone else, then it might be worth your while to win her over—but do not get your hopes up. When you two start hanging out a lot, people will start talking and wondering if you two are dating or if you have a \\"thing.\\" If people ask you about it, just say, \\"we like hanging out,\\" or, \\"we have a lot of fun together.\\" Never say, \\"we are just friends.\\" This will give her the wrong impression. Ask her if she would like to hang out sometime, but don't make it sound like a date. As you spend more time with her, invite fewer and fewer people, so that eventually you can just say, \\"Want to hang out this weekend?\\" If she says no thanks, don't drop it yet. She is likely not comfortable enough with you, but she may come around if you keep talking to her. You could explain that it wouldn't be a date, just going to the movies as friends, or hanging out and going swimming.

Find common interests and discuss them, while also being considerate by doing nice things occasionally but not too often.

Gradually reduce the number of people and invite her to hang out one-on-one without making it seem like an official date. Respect her current relationship status and be patient, as she may not initially feel comfortable hanging out alone.

Paragraph: The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.

News article: Autopsy Cites ‘Intentionally Removed’ Plug in Ruling Kayaker’s Death a Homicide The medical examiner’s conclusion is clear: Vincent Viafore, who the police say was killed by his fiancée during a kayaking trip on the Hudson River this past spring, was a victim of homicide caused by a “kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.” But the lawyer for the fiancée, Angelika Graswald, said the medical examiner’s office had overstepped its bounds with that determination. He said it was based on police speculation, not an examination of Mr. Viafore’s body. “Clearly, the Orange County medical examiner failed to conduct any meaningful investigation of her own and relied on false information provided by the New York State Police,” the lawyer, Richard A. Portale, said on Thursday, referring to Jennifer L. Roman, who performed the autopsy for the medical examiner’s office in Orange County, N.Y. “She ruled this a homicide without a scintilla of medical evidence,” Mr. Portale added. He argued that the reference to the kayak plug in the autopsy report could prejudice a jury. Since May, when Mr. Viafore’s body was pulled from the Hudson, prosecutors have declined to identify a cause of death or release the autopsy. A copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times. It was unsurprising in some of its conclusions. It lists the cause of death as drowning (Mr. Viafore, 46, who was not wearing a life jacket, capsized in 46-degree water, cold enough to quickly cause hypothermia). The toxicology results attached gave his blood alcohol concentration as 0.066 percent, close to the legal limit of 0.08 and consistent with Ms. Graswald’s account that the couple, who shared an apartment in Poughkeepsie, paddled to Bannerman Island on April 19, where Mr. Viafore had a few beers. The autopsy offers a grim, methodical accounting of Mr. Viafore’s body, which was recovered from the middle of the river on May 23. His face and abdomen were bloated, the report says, and marked by a mottled red and green discoloration. Besides evidence of drowning, the only injuries noted in the report are a two-inch abrasion on the left torso and bruises on the lower chest and arm, also on the left side. The police have made no reference to a possible struggle between Mr. Viafore and Ms. Graswald, 35, while they were in their kayaks, though they have said Ms. Graswald moved his paddle out of his reach after he went in the water. Some legal experts agreed with Mr. Portale’s contention that the medical examiner’s conclusions had gone too far. Jeanine Pirro, a former district attorney in Westchester County who now hosts “Justice With Judge Jeanine” on Fox News Channel, said medical examiners typically gave the manner of death, whether accident, suicide, homicide or undetermined, without elaborating. “That is a very unusual way of describing manner of death,” Ms. Pirro said in a phone interview. “It’s rare that you get something next to the manner of death that is so outside the analysis of the body.” “Let’s assume that the drain plug was removed,” she added. “It doesn’t mean it’s a homicide. It could mean that it was removed by accident. What does that have to do with the drowning? If that’s what the medical examiner thinks, she’s going to have to back that up on the stand.” The medical examiner’s office referred questions about the report to the Orange County executive’s office. The county executive’s office defended the medical examiner’s actions. Justin Rodriguez, a spokesman for the county executive, Steven M. Neuhaus, said a medical examiner could use facts outside of the autopsy, citing a state law that addresses determinations about cause and manner of death. “Obviously this statute envisions that the autopsy is only one aspect of the medical examiner’s examination into the cause of death,” he said. “If medical examiners were limited to basing their conclusions solely on a physical examination of the body, there would be no coroner inquests. The coroners and medical examiners have been doing this for over 100 years.” The case has captivated residents of the Hudson Valley and beyond, for both its puzzling circumstances and the defendant’s behavior. For more than a week after Mr. Viafore’s drowning, the police described it as an accident. Ms. Graswald, meanwhile, was posting numerous photographs and videos to Facebook that showed her smiling broadly, doing cartwheels and kayaking. After Ms. Graswald was charged on April 30, the police said she had implicated herself in the killing. At a bail hearing later, they quoted her as having said, among other things, that it “felt good knowing he was going to die.” Mr. Portale, her lawyer, said his client’s statements to the police had been coerced. Complicating matters is the assertion by Mr. Portale that the kayak’s drain plug had been missing for some time. Kayaking experts have said that a missing plug would not necessarily cause a boat to sink because the hole it closes, at the top of the vessel, is so small. (Mr. Viafore’s kayak did not sink to the bottom of the river, and was later found near shore.) Such plugs, kayaking instructors say, are designed to make it easy to rid the kayak of excess water by flipping it over on dry land. In very choppy conditions, water can splash directly into the cockpit, causing the kayak to ride low in the water and making it unstable. Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert and chairman of the department of sciences at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, also found the reference to the kayak plug troubling, particularly the description that it was “intentionally removed by other.” Calling the reference a “red herring,” Dr. Kobilinsky said that medical examiners can and do consider police reports and other information besides the physical examination in arriving at a manner of death. However, he said, the leap from ruling a death a homicide to suggesting it was murder is not one a medical examiner should make. “That’s not something the medical examiner should be writing down,” he said of the reference to the plug’s intentional removal. “It already presumes it’s a murder. Homicide can be justified or not justified, or it can be an accident. It simply means that one person causes the death of another.” “The way it was written,” he added, “sounds like the medical examiner was saying it’s clearly a murder based on pulling the plug. But that’s a big hop, skip and a jump, and in a courtroom, all of this stuff will get dissected to the finest detail.” Correction: September 10, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which the police say Angelika Graswald killed her fiancée, Vincent Viafore, during a kayaking trip. It was April 19, not April 10. A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2015, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Intentionally Removed’ Plug Cited in Ruling Kayaker Death a Homicide. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article discusses the case of Vincent Viafore, who was reportedly killed by his fiancée Angelika Graswald during a kayaking trip on the Hudson River. The medical examiner's conclusion states that Viafore's death was a homicide caused by a \\"kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.\\" However, the lawyer for Graswald argued that the medical examiner's office based their determination on police speculation rather than an examination of Viafore's body and that the reference to the kayak plug could prejudice a jury. The case has gained much attention from residents of the Hudson Valley and beyond due to the puzzling circumstances and the defendant's behavior. Graswald initially posted numerous photographs and videos on social media showing her smiling and kayaking after Viafore's drowning, which had been described as an accident by the police for over a week. Complicating the case, Graswald's lawyer has claimed that the kayak's drain plug was missing for some time, while kayaking experts maintain that a missing plug would not necessarily cause a boat to sink. The inclusion of the reference to the missing kayak plug in the medical examiner's report has sparked debate over whether the medical examiner's conclusions are overreaching, as some argue that the leap from ruling a death a homicide to suggesting it was a murder is not one a medical examiner should make."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \\"sea king star\\" (海王星), because Neptune was the god of the sea.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett combined strength, speed, and skill to produce many spectacular highlights and goal-kicking feats. A noted big game player, Ablett kicked 43 goals in 11 State appearances. More significantly, he booted 64 goals over the course of his 16 finals - an average of four goals a game. His haul of 27 goals in the 1989 finals series is a record that still stands. He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players (the others being Maurice Rioli -1982, Nathan Buckley -2002, and Chris Judd -2005) to win the medal playing for the losing side. In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals. Martin Flanagan's representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel The Call is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions--they simply did what came naturally to them, \\"like a lot of artists\\". Ablett is the subject of the song \\"Kicking the Footy with God\\", released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album In Bed with My Doona. In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer. In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he switch teams?","completion":"Imagine you're listening to a story about a really good football player named Gary Ablett.

He scored lots of goals when he played and even won special awards for being the best player on the field sometimes. He also became part of a special club of football players who scored 1000 goals. People liked to sing and write about Gary because he was like a superhero on the football field. He got into special teams because he was so good, and people even named a part of a stadium after him.

Bugs Bunny is underneath the podium drinking carrot juice when Sam makes a pledge to make good on his previous promise \\"to rid this country of every last rabbit\\" if elected. Bugs then decides he needs to fight against Sam by running against him for mayor. Bugs proceeds to quickly try and win the townspeople over with Theodore Roosevelt's famous \\"I speak softly, but I carry a BIG stick!\\" quote, even dressing up like Roosevelt. However, Sam declares \\"I speak LOUD and I carry a BIGGER stick, and I use it too!\\" (When watching this on The Bugs Bunny Show, Daffy Duck says \\"I speak medium, and I carry the BIGGEST stick.) Sam has more than a few tricks up his sleeve. He steals Bugs' cigar stand, to which Bugs switches his \\"SMELLO\\" cigars with five-cent ATOM Explosive Cigars (\\"You Will Get A BANG Out of This\\"). He sends a boxful of \\"assorted\\" picnic ants to steal all of the food at Bugs' picnic, to which Bugs hides a dynamite stick in a watermelon for him. Then he rigs a cannon at the front door of Bugs' headquarters and greets Bugs with friendship at the back door, but the plan backfires on him when Bugs pretends that a pretty girl named Emma who loves Sam is at the front door. Then he challenges Bugs, asking him if he can \\"play the pi-anna\\", and Bugs takes the challenge, so he rigs explosives in the piano at a certain key and presents the piano to Bugs to play \\"Those Endearing Young Charms\\" (a gag recycled from a Private Snafu short), but Bugs misplays the tune on purpose to infuriate Sam, who plays it correctly and falls for his own trap. A quick chase through the streets leads the pair to the parade for the newly elected mayor.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"If everything is not spelled out in a treaty, how are details clarified?\\" is in \\"In the United States, the term \\"treaty\\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"Certainly. In the United States, when everything is not explicitly spelled out in a treaty, the details can be clarified through several mechanisms, primarily executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements, which are all considered treaties under international law but have different approval processes under U.S. law. 1. Executive Agreements: These agreements are made by the President with the authority granted by an existing treaty. They help elaborate or clarify the specific provisions of the treaty without requiring any additional treaties or protocols. 2. Congressional-Executive Agreements: These agreements require approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate by a majority vote. They can be approved either before or after the treaty is signed by the President, allowing the legislative branch to have a say in the clarification or interpretation of treaty provisions. 3. Sole Executive Agreements: The President, acting alone, can execute these agreements without needing additional approval from the Senate or the House of Representatives. They provide the President with some flexibility in clarifying or implementing treaty provisions. In summary, when a treaty does not include all the necessary details, the gaps can be filled through various types of agreements (executive, congressional-executive, and sole executive agreements), which either involve the President independently or in collaboration with the legislative branch.

Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman.

On your Xbox 360's Power button, there will most likely be one to four red flashing lights displaying around the perimeter of the button; these lights pertain to different problems. If you don't see an error code when you turn on the Xbox 360, skip ahead to the \\"Replace the power brick\\" step. Depending on the number of flashing quadrants, the problem could be one of four main things: One red quadrant — Displays when a hardware component (e.g., the fan or a connected USB stick) stops working. Two red quadrants — Signifies that your console has overheated. This will normally go away on its own, but you can take steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Three red quadrants — Indicates that a serious error regarding one or more hardware components has occurred. This is the infamous \\"Red Ring of Death\\" error. Full red circle — Indicates that an A/V connection has been lost. You won't see this for Xbox 360s which use HDMI cables. If you see one red quadrant light up on your Xbox 360's Power button, you'll also see an error code appear on the connected television. Since there are numerous codes you might see, the easiest way to address your specific error is by typing the error code followed by xbox 360 error into a search engine, selecting a reputable search result, and following the instructions. Unfortunately, you'll have to take your Xbox 360 in for repairs if you can't address the error by looking it up. While your console's two flashing red lights will disappear on their own after the console comes down in temperature, there are a few things you can do to prevent your console from overheating in the future: Make sure the console has plenty of space in all directions. Lay your console horizontally, not vertically. Clean any dust out of the console's vents (you can use a damp cloth or a vacuum for this). Keep the console in a cool, dry place; avoid having it in the sun or near a heater. . The Red Ring of Death is somewhat non-specific, but you may be able to fix it by applying a new layer of thermal paste to your Xbox 360's heat sinks. As with most internal issues, the Red Ring of Death is a problem best left to professionals. The easiest way to fix this error is by using an HDMI cable to connect your Xbox 360 to your TV; if that isn't an option, check your current A/V cables to see how they're plugged in. If they're loose, tighten them and then restart your console. If your A/V cables are fine, you'll need to replace them. If the error continues displaying even when using new A/V cables, your console's A/V input may be broken. You can either send your console in for repairs or switch over to a different display that allows you to use an HDMI cable. Microsoft's official policy for a CD drive that's stuck open is to wiggle the tray from side to side, wiggle it up and down, and then gently push it shut. If pressing the \\"Eject\\" button doesn't prompt the tray to pop out, you'll need to take the Xbox 360 in for service. If the CD drive is stuck shut, you can try opening it by pushing a bent paper clip into the \\"Eject\\" hole on the front or back of the console. If this doesn't work, your Xbox 360 needs service. If the CD drive works but won't read two or more of your game discs, try removing any attached USB items. If it still won't read your discs, you'll need to take your Xbox 360 in for service. For problems not related to an error code (e.g., unexpected shut-downs), you may need to replace your Xbox 360's power source. This is because Xbox 360 power bricks have roughly 5 years of life before they begin to malfunction. Malfunctioning power bricks can also cause your Xbox 360 to freeze or otherwise under-perform. If your Xbox 360 won't turn on even after replacing the power brick, check the USB slots to see if any of their connectors are bent. Bent connectors can cause the Xbox 360 to fail to turn on; if they are bent, prying them loose with a screwdriver may fix the problem. If you use an HDMI cable and your Xbox 360 isn't displaying video properly, you can try using a different HDMI cable to address the problem. Keep in mind that the problem may also lie with your TV, in which case you'll either need to use a different HDMI port on your TV or use a different TV entirely. If none of the above instructions have fixed the problem you're having with your Xbox 360, you'll need to send it in for repairs.","completion":"This article talks about different problems you might face with your Xbox 360, like red flashing lights, and gives tips on how to fix them or when to take it for repairs."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him. As I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too.

During a movie trip, Tia gets a strong feeling about a man getting into a car across the street. She runs over to him and tells him that he should not get into the car. The man listens and decides to walk and get picked later by the chauffeur-driven car. Just then an out-of-control pick-up truck crashes into the door where the man would have been seated.

Here are the pop stars who tried their luck on the silver screen IT seems that being a successful musician isn’t enough these days. Rather than sticking with their original passion, many talented stars are adding even more strings to their bows and breaking into the acting industry. This week, it was reported that Rihanna is set to join the Oceans Eight all-star cast, while Jennifer Lopez had landed the role of cocaine queen Griselda Blanco for an upcoming HBO biopic too. They’re not the only ones. From rappers to rock stars, we take a look at some of the most memorable musicians that took the leap… Her incredible success in music has made her one of the most successful female solo artists of all time – but being Beyoncé, she wasn’t happy with simply selling 100million records worldwide. The star, who is married to Jay-Z, landed her first role in 2001 and has since starred in Austin Powers: Goldmember, The Pink Panther, Dreamgirls and Life is But a Dream. She's only 28 years old, but there's very little she hasn't done. As well as an astounding career in music, the Barbadian singer has starred in Battleship, Home and is rumoured to be joining the Ocean's Eight cast this year. He started his career as the MC of hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, but now Will Smith is better known as an award-winning actor. Some of his most notable movies include Men in Black, Hitch, Seven Pounds and, more recently, Suicide Squad. The pop princess gained notoriety through her music and after three successful albums, she starred in Crossroads. The 2002 film received mainly negative reviews, but still managed to make £47million at the box office. The former N'Sync star made a name for himself in music but, like Britney, starred in TV shows as a teenager. He utilised his acting talent after becoming famous, making the move to the silver screen in 2005 with a role alongside Morgan Freeman in Edison. He has since starred in The Social Network, Friends With Benefits and Bad Teacher, and continues to act today. Perhaps not quite as successful as her counterparts, Swifty made her acting debut with a minor role in Valentine's Day. The star, who is dating actor Tom Hiddleston, later lent her voice to The Lorax movie as Audrey and also made a cameo in 2014's The Giver. Now she seems to be now focusing her attention on her music career. It may come as a surprise to discover that the rapper has racked up countless acting roles in his career. Some of his performances include voicing the character of Smooth Move in Turbo and comedic roles in Starsky & Hutch and Scary Movie 5. The singer may have firmed up her status as a true icon through her music, but her movie roles speak for themselves. The star, who was previously married to director Guy Ritchie, has had over 20 film roles during her career, including those in Desperately Seeking Susan, Evita and Die Another Day. The actor formed the band Thirty Seconds to Mars back in 1998, running the show as the lead vocalist and songwriter. Meanwhile, he was making a name for himself in the acting world and played supporting roles in Fight Club, American Psycho and The Thin Red Line. He took a break to focus on his music, but later returned to movie making and quickly gained notoriety, winning awards for his talents. Leto's most notable performances include those in Dallas Buyers Club and Suicide Squad. The singer has worked hard on her acting career while simultaneously making music. She has since become a rom-com favourite, starring in Maid in Manhattan, Shall We Dance, The Wedding Planner and The Back-Up Plan.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What event was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years?, using the article: With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976,..., what would be the answer ?

Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily. Question: Who did Roland pledged his love to?

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the character who scolds Hector for fighting?, using the article: Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \\"No work, no pay\\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The name of the character who scolds Hector for fighting is Rosa, his mother. As detailed in the article, Hector Villa is a hardworking young man who earns money not only from working on a Texas farm but also from participating in small-time, illegal gambling fights. After one such fight, Hector is scolded by Tito, a coyote who smuggles immigrants across the border. However, it is Hector's mother, Rosa, who explicitly scolds him for fighting to make money. She is concerned about his well-being and reminds him of the consequences of a fighter's lifestyle, as experienced by Hector's late father. It is apparent that Rosa is getting worse due to her illness, but she insists on working since not working would mean not getting paid. She is also a significant figure in Maria's life, as Maria and Hector grew up together and Rosa has known Maria since her childhood. Rosa plays a role in Hector's story not only as an influence on his decisions and actions but also as a person he cares for and tries to provide for in her time of illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body.

The tweet states: \\"It was fun while it lasted.. No more 9.A\\" Generally, sentiment analysis classifies text into three main categories: positive, negative, or neutral. In this case, the sentiment of the tweet appears to be a mix of both positive and negative emotions. Positive sentiment: The first part of the tweet, \\"It was fun while it lasted,\\" shows a sense of nostalgia or fond memories of a past experience that was enjoyable (fun) for the user. This expression indicates that they appreciated the time they spent in this particular situation or activity, making this part of the tweet convey a positive sentiment. Negative sentiment: The second part of the tweet, \\"No more 9.A,\\" communicates that the enjoyable experience has come to an end and the user is possibly sad or disappointed about it. The phrase \\"no more\\" signifies something is no longer occurring or available, which may give a sense of finality or loss, leading to a negative sentiment.

Just moments earlier, she had so confidently handed it to Satina, speaking softly about its power, about its ability to trace Vane. And now, as Satina stared at the word so carelessly etched onto the side of the vessel, she could feel her heart pounding against her ribcage, struggling to escape the confines of her body. Death. The word seemed to echo around the small clearing, mixing with the howling wind that blew through the low branches of the surrounding trees. It was a warning, a cautionary label that underscored the threat this jar posed – not only to Vane but potentially to them all. Satina wondered if Hadja had fully understood the consequences of what she had done, of what she had so thoughtlessly brought into their midst. \\"What have you done, Hadja?\\" Satina whispered heatedly, her voice quivering with a mixture of fear and rage. \\"Why would you bring this? Do you even know what it means?\\" Hadja looked up from the jar, her eyes wide with surprise. Clearly, she hadn't expected Satina to react in such a way. \\"I – I didn't mean any harm,\\" she stammered, clutching the clay vessel to her chest. \\"I thought it might help us find Vane.\\" \\"You thought wrong,\\" Satina hissed, tearing her eyes from the chilling word on the jar's side and fixing Hadja with a venomous glare. \\"This... this thing,\\" she said, waving a trembling hand at the jar, \\"it's dangerous.\\" Hadja glanced down at the jar, frowning in confusion. \\"But how can it be? It's just a simple tracing spell, Satina,\\" she insisted, her voice small and wavering, as though even she was not entirely convinced by her own words. \\"I swear, I never meant for anything bad to happen.\\" Satina could see the genuine fear in Hadja's eyes, the pained desperation with which she clung to the belief that she had made a grave mistake. But even so, her anger could not entirely be assuaged. \\"We can't use this, Hadja,\\" she said firmly, her voice suddenly hard and unyielding. \\"Whatever spell this jar contains, it's not worth the risk.\\" Hadja looked as though she might argue, but ultimately, she nodded her head, the motion slow and heavy with defeat. \\"Very well,\\" she murmured, carefully setting the jar back down in the grass. \\"I'm... I'm sorry, Satina.\\" Satina watched her go, her body still trembling with the force of her emotions. As the other woman disappeared back into the treeline, Satina glanced once more at the jar, her gaze lingering on the word that had sent chills racing down her spine. Death. Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around herself, as if that might somehow protect her from the unknown dangers that now seemed to surround them. For the first time, Satina found herself questioning the lengths to which she and her friends were willing to go in their desperation to find Vane – and, more importantly, she began to wonder whether some lines were better left uncrossed. Unbeknownst to her, as Satina turned away from the jar and followed Hadja into the shadows of the forest, a thin, black tendril of smoke slowly began to rise from the vessel's firmly sealed lid, twisting and snaking its way into the darkness of the night sky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","completion":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that \\"Presently, addresses are required on such pieces,\\" which refers to the necessity of including an address on parcels. This suggests that in the current context, it is mandatory to have an address on any parcel being sent. On the other hand, the hypothesis posits that \\"Any parcel may be sent anonymously.\\" This statement implies that a parcel can be sent without disclosing the sender's identity, which seemingly contradicts the premise requiring addresses on all parcels. The fact that addresses are required on parcels in the present context does not automatically infer that the parcels can be sent anonymously. It is important to note that having an address on a parcel does not necessarily reveal the complete identity of the sender, but it does provide some information that could potentially be traced back to the sender, making it less likely for the parcel to be truly anonymous. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because, while it acknowledges the necessity of an address on parcels, it does not confirm the possibility of sending parcels entirely anonymously."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But don't let the basic elements hold you captive. Be creative and make up your own power. If not, try considering things like electricity, superhuman strength, telekinesis, flight, ice, darkness (a good one), or anything you want. Combining more than one power is also possible, but don't make it too strong. Remember, the good guy should always win...for some reason. The whole \\"Taking Over The World\\" thing is outdated. Be more original. For example, Magneto (X-Men) was seen as evil because he was tired of humans treating him and all mutants like trash. Mr Freeze (Batman) had the whole story with his wife - if you watched the movie, you'd know. Nevertheless, let the villain have a good, genuine reason for being so mean (e.g. jealousy, alienation, revenge, protection). A laugh is a confirmation of their power, so it has to suit them. Pick it out carefully. You could choose the deep Dracula kind of chuckle for the guys, the high toned witch cackle could suit some females, but not all. Others would rather prefer the lower mysterious laugh, that is sometimes even confused with a giggle. There are countless choices. In complex plots, henchmen have their very own personalities and would not be considered as part of the super villain. But if the story is short and simple, a henchman can be limited. Give them a basic good quality - e.g. brains, strength, speed, obedience, bravery - and a basic bad quality - e.g. stupidity, clumsiness, cowardice. They don't have to look like the villain, but it would be good if they shared some characteristics or ideas. They could have, for example, the same goal and reason to be doing such dastardly crime. It could be a physical thing, like Achilles' heel, or a mental or inner flaw like greed or jealousy. He could have also been betrayed. But don't let it be an accident, his or her defeat. The point is to teach people that crime does not pay, so let his loss be by flaw. Throughout the story, show signs of his flaw, as Caesar showed signs of his arrogance throughout the Shakespearean play, and it was this flaw which caused him to die.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You may have difficulty fighting the urge to procrastinate, but keep in mind that feedback and revisions can sometimes take up to a week. If you wait, you may forget a lot of important details from the experiment. Having a rough version of your report at the ready a month in advance can save you from unnecessary stress and from having to turn in unpolished work. You may have performed supplemental experiments/simulations, or repeated your initial experience after receiving your first round of feedback. Feedback should go through the following stages ideally: (a) Self-review and revision (b) Peer review and constructive feedback (c) Advisor/instructor review and feedback The goal of your experiment or the goal of proving or disproving certain hypotheses is essentially unimportant when you are writing a lab report. The data contained in it could be anything, and you may very well have to write lab reports in the future that seem silly or unnecessary. The goal of your lab report is to be read and evaluated by another person, like your instructor. It can help to remind yourself of this goal at the beginning of every section before you start writing. When you finish a section of your report, read it through carefully and at the end of it, ask yourself: was that easy to read and understand? Did I succeed in my goal? The narrowest purpose of your lab report is to enable your seniors, advisors, and/or an evaluation committee to confirm your ability to consistently and clearly produce a report. But once you start devising and performing labs of your own, it's quite possible that your peers or juniors will utilize it as a resource. If you believe your paper might be of use to researchers in another discipline, like a social science, you may want to include definitions or explanations for the more technical jargon used in your paper. Take a piece of scrap paper and pencil and list the necessary sections of your lab report in order. Under each section, jot a few sentences that summarize what must be covered in that section. Due to the fact that different instructors have different preferences, you should check your lab report handout or course syllabus to verify expectations for the order and content of your report. Most lab reports are organized, first to last: background information, problem, hypothesis, materials, procedure, data, and your interpretation of what happened as a conclusion. Technical aspects of your paper might require significant explanation. This may necessitate the use of subsections so that you can appropriately delve into and explain those nuanced aspects of your lab problem. The organization of the body of your lab report will be specific to your problem/experiment. You may also have a separate section for the statement of your design methodology, experimental methodology, or proving subsidiary/intermediary theorems in your report.

Write highlights for this article: Vauxhall has been on a roll this week, announcing hundreds of new jobs in Britain ahead of the launch of the new Astra family hatchback, which is to be built at its factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. And it's also released details of the new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini. It's set for its official launch at the Paris Motor Show in October, priced from less than £10,000. Vauxhall is out to knock Ford's Fiesta off the top sales spot. The current Corsa — its best-seller — sold 83,000 in the UK in the past year, against around 121,000 Fiestas. Supercar: Vauxhall's new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini is set to launch in October. Although almost as long as the outgoing model, Vauxhall says almost every other aspect of the new car's design and engineering has been changed to 'significantly improve' it. That includes a re-designed instrument panel and dashboard and Vauxhall's IntelliLink communications system, which operates through a 7in colour touchscreen, is compatible with smartphones and incorporates extra features, such as voice command. The new model, pictured right, will be available with heated front seats, steering wheel and windscreen, as well as 'soft-tone' ambient lighting and an optional, full-size panoramic roof. Available in three and fivedoor versions, the next-generation Corsa has a new chassis, better suspension and speedsensitive power steering, while the chassis has been tuned for a smoother drive, with more precise steering, to cater for what Vauxhall calls Britain's 'unique and challenging topography'. Does it mean our crumbling, potholed roads? Star exhibit: Princess Diana's Austin Mini Metro will be on display at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional. A red Austin Mini Metro once owned by Princess Diana — and affectionately known as the 'Courting Car' — will be the star exhibit at an event that aims to be the antidote to all those posh, glittering supercar extravaganzas. Normally in Coventry Transport Museum, it makes its first public outing in around 20 years at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional later this month. Said to have been a gift from Prince Charles to the then Lady Diana Spencer during their courtship, the car will headline the first 'Concours de l'Ordináire' in Towcester, Northants. The event promises 'the finest collection of mauve interiors and beige exteriors ever brought together in one place', within a show that 'humorously celebrates the best examples of some of the most mundane British and European cars ever built' between 1968 and 1985. An spokesman said: 'The 1980 Metro is the final entry on a list of 50 truly unexceptional vehicles and highlights how a great era of ordinary cars has become endangered.' Other unexceptional specimens include a Peel P50, a three-wheeled micro-car, produced from 1962 to 1965, and an Austin Maestro — a distant cousin of the Metro — owned by the grand-daughter of the aristocrat who financed William Morris, to create his celebrated, eponymous company.

Its functionalities extend far beyond mere text editing. One of the key features it boasts is the document recovery mechanism. This article will guide you on how to embrace this feature to retrieve your automatically saved documents when necessary. A simple yet effective guidance to follow is clicking on the \\"Yes\\" button when a dialog box prompts you if you want to load your automatically saved files in Word. For example, suppose you are suddenly disconnected due to power outage or system crashes; in that case, Word's AutoRecover feature automatically prompts you with a recovery dialogue when you reopen the program. Upon opening Microsoft Word post-crash scenario, a dialogue box will be abruptly presented asking if you're desirous of loading your automatically saved files. Here, your instructions will be to give a positive response by clicking on the \\"yes\\" button. Yielding to these steps ensures that any data retained during the system crash is loaded onto Word for your perusal. Next, you will find the Document Recovery Task Pane to your left, a particular space where the most recent automatically saved Word files are listed. This panel essentially demonstrates all the recoverable Word files post a sudden crash. By facilitating easy access to these recent files, this tool saves the time one would typically use to manually search for these documents. Going forward, to understand the files' contents, the Word document recovery mechanism permits you to open and review each file version within the Document Recovery Task Pane. This makes it conceivable to keep track of the latest modifications made in each file, especially focusing on areas missing content. Arguably the most inclusive data recovery tool, the Document Recovery Task Pane, enables users to save the versions of the document they would love to keep, thus ensuring no vital information is lost. Additionally, it gives users an option to delete the surplus, irrelevant versions. This can be done by replying to the prompts accordingly. Prompt responses streamline your task and save on computer storage. In conclusion, data loss can be stressful and time-consuming. Fortunately, Microsoft Word's ingenious feature of document recovery facilitates an easy, user-friendly mode of preventing such occurrences. With a simple click on the \\"Yes\\" button, viewing your recently saved Word files in the Document Recovery Task Pane, reviewing them for missing content, and storing or discarding versions as per their relevance, your data stays secure.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. Guess a valid title for it!

Karine Charbonnier-Beck was hailed as a bold speaker of truth to power for her appearance three weeks ago on the TF1 programme Face aux Francais (Face to Face with the French), in which the president was questioned by members of the public. Her frank denunciation of the government's business policies, and refusal to be impressed by President Hollande's attempts to explain, made an instant hit. After being inundated with mostly complimentary tweets and emails from across the country, she has now been offered a regular slot on one of France's leading radio chat-shows. \\"I thought it was important to tell the president exactly what we have to go through as small business-owners,\\" she says in an interview at the Beck Industries factory in Armentieres, on the Belgian border. \\"When French people think about business, they automatically imagine rich tycoons and the CEOs of massive multinationals. \\"They don't realise that most of the work is done at a much more humble level. After the broadcast I got so many messages from viewers saying how refreshing it was to hear things from a different angle.\\" In the television programme, Ms Charbonnier-Beck upbraided the president for failing to understand the reality of running a business. She said that by simply moving a few kilometres across the frontier into Belgium, she could save Beck Industries â‚¬3m (3.7m/Â£2.3m) in taxes and charges every year. Her staff would also earn more because of lower payroll taxes. Ms Charbonnier-Beck said that President Hollande had failed to live up to his promise to simplify red tape. In fact, she said, there had been a process of \\"complexification\\"; and she urged a reform of the trade union system which, in its current form, hindered industrial relations. As for the president's responses, she says she was distinctly unimpressed. \\"I imagined that he would have come prepared for the event and used the section with me to announce some new initiative on business. But there was nothing of the kind. \\"I didn't have the feeling he was listening to anything I said. The answers had nothing to do with my questions. It is impossible to know what the president really thinks about anything. He says whatever he thinks the people he is with will want to hear.\\" Ms Charbonnier-Beck is the fourth generation of her family to run Beck Industries, which was set up in 1919 in a town destroyed in World War One. Armentieres, which lies a little south of Ypres, was on the frontline for four years. After meeting at one of France's top business schools HEC, she and her husband Hugues began at the company 20 years ago. Ten years ago they took over the reins from Karine's father. \\"After HEC we had the chance to go to the US. There was a choice: Harvard or Armentieres. Naturally we chose Armentieres,\\" laughs Ms Charbonnier-Beck. With its crumbling industrial heritage and surrounding fields of Brussels sprouts, Armentieres may not be the most picturesque of locations. But it has provided a solid base for the business. Today the company owns factories at Aberdeen and Wolverhampton in the UK, as well as in Belgium and Germany. The factories all make heavy bolts and fastenings for use in the oil, gas and nuclear power industries. Overall Beck employs some 700 people. \\"We have been very impressed by the British approach to business. It is so very different from the French way,\\" says Hugues Charbonnier. \\"In France we are very good at mastering a core of competences and really excelling at them. But in the UK there is always the desire to move on, to try something new. Probably the perfect world would involve a synthesis of the two approaches.\\" Karine says that she and her husband are very proud of what they have achieved. \\"We know we are a very good company,\\" she says. \\"But we need to invest if we are to stay ahead of the competition. And the only way we can do that is if we start making more profits. That means there have to be lower charges.\\" And has taking on the president had any effect? Has the publicity gone to her head? \\"Not a bit of it. I have started turning down requests for interviews and the radio appearance will only be one evening every couple of weeks,\\" she says. \\"It is important to get our message across.

Create a goal-oriented timeline.\\"","completion":"Title: Enhancing the Learning Journey: A Goal-Oriented Approach for Success Introduction In an increasingly competitive world, learning new skills and enhancing existing ones is the key to success. Whether it's for personal growth, career development or merely a hobby, pursuing an education presents the opportunity to expand our knowledge and capabilities. As a tutor or educator, it's vital to guide learners with a tailored approach to ensure they attain their educational goals. The following steps offer a solid framework for creating a goal-oriented timeline that can foster accelerated progress and satisfaction in any learner. Step 1: Inquire about their reasons for wanting to learn now Understanding the motivation behind a learner's decision to pursue a particular subject is crucial in devising a personalized educational plan. Start by asking questions based on their interests, career aspirations, and personal ambitions. This step enables the learner to reflect on the reasons behind their decision, which will affect their dedication and focus during the learning journey. As an educator, this insight helps you develop a tailored strategy that aligns with the learner's goals and aspirations. Whether the learner wants to advance in their career, pursue a personal passion or fulfill a long-held dream, your understanding of their motivation empowers you to deliver a stimulating and enriching learning experience. Step 2: Assess their current skill level Before diving into the learning process, it's essential to determine the learner's existing knowledge and skills. A comprehensive assessment helps you understand their strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. This information allows you to set realistic benchmarks and create a customized learning plan that caters to the individual's abilities. A variety of assessment methods can be employed, such as quizzing, observation, and self-assessment questionnaires. Employing a combination of these techniques will give you an all-encompassing understanding of the learner's current skills, enabling you to devise a tailored approach that maximizes their potential for success. Step 3: Create a goal-oriented timeline With a clear understanding of the learner's motivation and current abilities, it's time to establish a well-defined, goal-oriented timeline that maps out their learning path. Creating this timeline involves setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that account for their aspirations as well as any potential roadblocks. First, set short, medium, and long-term objectives that encompass various milestones, from acquiring specific skill sets to achieving broader educational goals. The timeline should be flexible enough to accommodate inevitable setbacks and be adaptable to the learner's progress and evolving interests. Next, identify resources and strategies needed to achieve these goals effectively. This might include textbooks, online resources, and hands-on training. As an educator, implement teaching techniques that cater to the learner's preferred learning style, be it visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, to enhance their engagement and retention of knowledge. Lastly, set up regular checkpoints throughout the timeline to assess the learner's progress, providing feedback and modifying the learning plan as needed. This will ensure the learner stays on track and feels supported throughout their journey. Conclusion By diligently following this approach, educators and learners can cultivate a mutually beneficial learning experience marked by both achievement and personal growth. Inquiring about the learner's reasons for pursuing education, assessing their current skill levels, and creating a clear, goal-oriented timeline collectively aim to empower individuals to conquer new skills and emerge as confident, well-informed members of society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what are organic semiconductors and what is concept of homo and lumo in organic semiconductor I found the following answer on Google: While such classic mechanisms are important locally, as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors , tunnelling, localized states, mobility gaps , and phonon -assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction, particularly in polyacetylenes. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"Although the text you provided from Google touches upon some aspects related to organic semiconductors, it does not paint a complete picture, nor does it address the concept of HOMO and LUMO. Let me provide you with a more comprehensive and detailed answer. Organic semiconductors are materials composed of organic molecules (molecules with carbon-based structures) that exhibit semiconducting properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity under certain conditions. These properties make organic semiconductors suitable for various applications, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells, and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Organic semiconductors can be made from small molecules or polymers and are generally characterized by their relatively low cost, flexibility, and adjustable properties. The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) concepts play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of organic semiconductors. In general, molecular orbitals represent the available electron energy levels within a molecule. The HOMO refers to the highest occupied energy level that is filled with electrons, while the LUMO represents the first available, empty energy level where an electron can be excited or promoted to. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO levels is known as the bandgap, which is an essential parameter in semiconductors, determining their electrical and optical properties. In organic semiconductors, the relatively localized nature of HOMO and LUMO levels leads to a wide bandgap that results in low charge carrier mobility and distinct optoelectronic properties compared to inorganic semiconductors. Charge transport in organic semiconductors often involves mechanisms like hopping and tunneling between localized states, which can be influenced by various factors such as molecular orientation, crystal or polymer packing, and phonon-assisted processes. In summary, organic semiconductors are carbon-based materials with semiconducting properties, and the concepts of HOMO and LUMO are crucial for understanding the behavior and properties of these materials. While the excerpt you found on Google does mention some of these concepts, it does not provide a complete representation of the topic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following two consecutive losses to Dallas and San Diego, Philadelphia went to Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears, who were 4-5, on Sunday Night Football. The Eagles dominated the first quarter as Philadelphia took a two score lead on a 25-yard field goal by David Akers and a 13-yard touchdown from Donovan McNabb to Jason Avant on a wide receiver screen pass. Down 10-0 at the start of the second quarter, Chicago drove within one point as Bears kicker Robbie Gould successfully made a 45-yard field goal, as well as a pair of 28-yard field goals, to make the score 10-9 at the half. In the second half, the Bears took the lead as Robbie Gould kicked his fourth field goal, a 49-yarder that put Chicago up 12-10. However, it took only 30 seconds for the Eagles to take the lead as Donovan McNabb passed to DeSean Jackson for a 48-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17-12 lead. Ironically, the 48-yard touchdown catch was the shortest touchdown scored by Jackson thus far in the season. Chicago again took the lead in the third quarter as struggling quarterback Jay Cutler, who had already missed several wide open targets in the game, passed to tight end Kellen Davis for a 15-yard score. The Bears converted the 2-point conversion attempt as running back Matt Forte scored on the pass from Cutler to put the Bears back on top 20-17. In the fourth quarter, both defenses fought back and forth but the only points of the final period were scored by Eagles running back LeSean McCoy on a 10-yard, game-winning touchdown run to put the Eagles up 24-20, the game's final score. With the win, the Eagles improved to 6-4. Ironically, the Eagles win came by the same score (24-20) in the same city (Chicago) at the same time and venue (Sunday Night Football on NBC) as when they had lost in week 4 of the 2008 season.

We have a math problem here, and we're going to solve it together. It looks scary, but don't worry, we'll take it step by step. The problem is: -3691*l - 3402*l + 189174 = -4786*l First, we'll want to combine the terms with \\"l\\" on the left side of the equation: (-3691 - 3402) * l + 189174 = -4786 * l Now let's do the math: -7093 * l + 189174 = -4786 * l We want to move all the \\"l\\" terms to one side of the equation, so let's add 7093 * l to both sides: -7093 * l + 7093 * l + 189174 = -4786 * l + 7093 * l which gives us: 189174 = 2307 * l Now, we want to solve for \\"l.\\" To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2307: 189174 / 2307 = 2307 * l / 2307 This simplifies to: 82 = l So, little buddy, the answer is l = 82!

Here are some concepts: city, look, stop What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"Sure, here's a comprehensive interpretation using these concepts: city, look, and stop. A city is a large and densely populated urban area that often serves as the cultural, commercial, or political hub of a region or country. Cities often exhibit various unique characteristics in their architecture, culture, and vibe that differentiate them from one another - a charm that attracts both residents and tourists alike. Contemporary cities are characterized by skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, consistent with the modernistic architectural style that starkly contrasts with the Gothic and Baroque styles seen in older cities. They symbolize advancement and progress and represent the amalgamation of diverse cultures, ideas, and innovations. The concept of 'look' usually refers to the act of directing one's gaze towards something or someone, often to visually inspect or admire. In different contexts, 'look' might take on different meanings, but primarily it concerns sensory perceptual experience. It could be an integral part of appreciating cities where looking closely at cityscapes, landmarks, cultural precincts or everyday street life reveals the city's character, its soul. It allows us to perceive the aesthetics and energy of civic existence. For instance, travelers may gaze upon the cityscape of New York from the top of the Empire State Building to absorb the city's majesty and grandeur, perhaps encapsulated in the twinkling lights and the towering skyscrapers that seemingly touch the sky. On the other hand, 'stop' refers to the action of ceasing movement or activity, often for a temporary period. Stop can be physical, like stopping at a red traffic light in a bustling city, signifying a pause in the haste of everyday life. But it can also be a state of emotional or mental cessation, often invoked to denote introspection or reflection. In the context of a city, for example, one may need to 'stop' amidst the city rush, look around, and soak up the vibrant city life. This cease in activity can also help preserve resources or mitigate environmental damage in cities; a concept famously implemented in cities like Paris and Bogota through the implementation of Car-Free days, where citizens are encouraged to stop using their cars for a day to reduce pollution. To summarize, the sentence integrating these three concepts could be: \\"In the heart of the bustling city, amid the humdrum of life and towering skyscrapers, one often finds the need to stop, look around, and admire the marvel of urban existence and its electrifying energy.\\" This sentence encapsulates the essence of these three concepts and their intricate interaction in defining our experiences in a cityscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Superfecundation Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the suggested answer does not accurately address the specific question about the depth of the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, it offers a general statement about the Atlantic Ocean being the second-largest of the world's oceanic divisions. To provide a more accurate and detailed response, it is important to address the actual depth of the Atlantic Ocean. The depth of the Atlantic Ocean varies greatly from one place to another, with its shallowest and deepest parts located at different points. On average, the Atlantic Ocean has a depth of about 3,339 meters (10,955 feet). However, its deepest point can be found in the Puerto Rico Trench, which plunges down to approximately 8,648 meters (28,373 feet) below the sea level. This subduction zone lies in the boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. It is crucial to note that ocean depths are dynamic and complex, and can be influenced by various geographical factors and submarine geological formations such as underwater mountains, trenches, and rift valleys. The Atlantic Ocean, being the second-largest ocean in the world, covers an area of approximately 106,460,000 square kilometers (41,100,000 square miles), allowing for a diverse range of depths and underwater topographies. To appropriately validate the given answer, you should consider revising the response to include information about the Atlantic Ocean's average depth, its deepest point in the Puerto Rico Trench, and the dynamic nature of ocean depths influenced by geological factors. Such an answer would provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the depth of the Atlantic Ocean, ensuring that those relying on this information have a clearer picture to better comprehend the complex world beneath the ocean's surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. If a person rushes to respond or share their own opinions, they stand in the way of empathy. Hold mock conversations in which one person talks while the other person hears them out completely. Encourage the listener to turn to face the speaker and make eye contact. The listener should be trying their best to understand what the other person is saying, not simply listening to reply. Those learning empathy need feedback to determine if they understand others' messages during communication. Saying what the person said back to them in a different way helps them double-check that they got the right message. Paraphrasing may sound like, “From what I'm hearing, you seem very shocked and upset about the results of your doctor's exam. Is that right?” If the message was not received correctly, the speaker can try to relay it again so that the listener understands. Paraphrasing can also be taught in practice situations to help them feel confident doing it in real-life conversations. Identifying what someone is feeling can be challenging in the moment. To build the skill, start at the end: with the emotion you think the person felt. Then, reflect back and analyze other details, like facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and the actual words that were said. For instance, if a wife guessed that her husband was angry, she might work backwards and recall that his arms were crossed, he was pacing, he had a sneer on his face, and his speech was overly sarcastic. Noting these details can help her read future nonverbal and verbal cues more easily. Help adults learn empathy by breaking down different scenarios and reflecting on the experiences of the people involved. This may work best by using scenes from popular movies or TV shows. For instance, a scene from a movie may portray two friends fighting. Have two people role-play the scene and discuss what each character may have been thinking and feeling, and what cues help you figure that out. Have everyone start by spending 5 or 10 minutes breathing deeply and generating good vibes about themselves. This might include silently repeating affirmations, like “I am worthy,\\" or simply envisioning giving oneself a warm hug. In subsequent meditation sessions, they can start focusing on a friend or family member. Radiate positive thoughts towards that one person for the full exercise—just for about 10 minutes. After focusing on loved ones for a few sessions, they can then progress to radiating good vibes to a virtual stranger, such as the nice barista at Starbucks or someone they heard about on the news. Loving-kindness helps connect with the deeper human side of oneself and others, increasing a person's ability to feel empathy. Summary:","completion":"1. Conduct mock conversations in which a listener focuses on understanding the speaker rather than responding. This includes making eye contact and facing the speaker. 2. Teach paraphrasing to ensure the listener understands the message correctly, allowing them to double-check their understanding. 3. Practice identifying emotions by analyzing facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and words spoken along with the emotions they represent. 4. Use role-playing scenarios, like scenes from movies or TV shows, to help adults analyze the emotional experiences of characters and learn empathy. 5. Encourage practicing loving-kindness meditation, starting with oneself, then focusing on friends, family, and eventually strangers, to help connect with the deeper human side of individuals and improve empathy skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Summers in Estonia are relatively mild, with average temperatures ranging from 16 to 20°C (61 to 68°F), while winters are cold and snowy with temperatures often dropping below 0°C (32°F). Due to its coastal location, Estonia experiences varying weather patterns, with coastal regions experiencing milder temperatures and more rainfall, while the inland regions have harsher winters and warmer summers. In terms of cultural heritage, Estonia is home to a rich tapestry of history, art, and traditions. The Estonian language is part of the Finno-Ugric language family, sharing close ties with Finnish and more distantly with Hungarian. The country has a population of approximately 1.3 million people, with ethnic Estonians making up the majority. Throughout its history, Estonia has been influenced by various neighboring countries and empires, such as the Swedish, Polish, Danish, German, and Russian empires. As a result, Estonia has a wealth of architectural, linguistic, and cultural influences, seen especially in its cities and countryside. Estonia is also known for its innovative spirit and technological advancements, being one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world. Estonia leads the European Union in digital services, electronic voting, e-government, and digital entrepreneurship. Moreover, a stable business environment and a developed startup ecosystem make Estonia an attractive location for foreign investments and talents. In conclusion, the region or geographic feature mentioned in the statement occupies 965 square kilometers of Estonia.

Short movie review: at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The phrase \\"at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age\\" used by the critic generates a vague sentiment about the movie, thus making it difficult to decisively discern if the critic was leaning positive or negative in their review. How the statement is interpreted mostly depends on the context in which it was deployed. If the critic is citing this deceleration of pace as a tool that the filmmakers used to allow a deeper immersion into the character development or intricacies of the plot, then it would denote a positive sentiment. Here, the slowed pace would be perceived as an advantage that enhances the viewing experience by offering the audience the time and space to dwell more deeply into the movie's narrative. In such a case, the critique could be taken as appreciation for the director's courage to defy the more popular fast-paced thrillers or action-packed movies. Perhaps, in this context, the slow pace signified the filmmaker's desire to promote reflection and contemplation, creating a unique rhythm preferred by movie lovers who enjoy thoughtful and nuanced storytelling. Conversely, if the critic found the movie to be boring, sluggish, or lacking momentum due to this reduced tempo, then the sentiment would likely tilt towards negative. In this scenario, the phrase suggests that the movie moved at such a slow pace that it could test the patience of viewers, especially those in middle age who might be accustomed to or prefer livelier narratives. If the slow pace failed to serve an artistic purpose and instead felt dull and dreary, the movie could come across as monotonous or tedious. Furthermore, the statement could also suggest that the critic felt that the themes or storylines of the movie were out of sync or unrelatable to their age or generation, rendering the movie somewhat stagnant or not in alignment with their personal preferences or the societal experiences that resonate with them. Overall, without additional context or information, it's challenging to determine unequivocally whether the critic's impression of the movie was positive or negative based solely on the phrase \\"at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age.\\" It suggests that the pace of the movie was slow – but whether this was a positive or negative factor largely depends on the critic's personal preferences and the broader context of their review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: Why don't plants need to eat like humans? A:","completion":"Plants don't need to eat like humans because they obtain their essential nutrients and carbohydrates from their environment rather than consuming food. They uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves.

Q:- Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is usually the generation of electricity. Let's delve a bit deeper into this entire process: 1. Coal Burning: The coal is brought to the power station where it is then crushed into powder as this increases its surface area, and hence its combustion rate. The crushed coal is then burned in a furnace. 2. Production of Steam Under Pressure: When the coal burns, the chemical energy is converted to heat energy. This heat energy is utilized to convert the water into steam inside the boiler. The steam is produced under high pressure. 3. Flow into a Turbine: The pressurized steam is transferred into a turbine. The heat energy in the steam is converted into kinetic energy as it expands and rushes against the blades of the turbine. This results in the movement or rotation of the turbine blades. 4. The Turbine Spins: The turbine's blades are coupled to the shaft of a generator. This means that when the steam turbine’s blades rotate, the generator also rotates. 5. Generation of Electricity: In the final step, when the rotating turbine spins the generator, it induces a flow of electrical charges in the generator’s windings, generating electricity. The generators work using Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction which states that a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force in a conductor. This process effectively converts mechanical energy (the spinning of the turbine) into electrical energy. So, the last step is often the electrical output from the generator is delivered to the homes and businesses that require it by distribution systems called power grids. By going through these steps, the original chemical potential energy stored within the coal is delivered to many power users as electrical energy. Of course, it is important to mention that this process also includes some auxiliary steps, such as the cooling of the steam after it has left the turbine to condense the steam back into water so it can be reused in the boiler. It is also crucial to note that not all kinetic energy of the steam can be utilized to produce mechanical energy in the turbine – a majority of it gets lost as waste heat. Modern power stations have measures in place to control or reduce these losses to improve efficiency. Thus, the process of converting coal into electricity is quite complex with multiple stages, but the ultimate goal is to generate electricity safely and as efficiently as possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cohen is seeking 250,000 in damages, alleging that the inadequate accommodations \\"ruined his summer.\\" Body: A legal feud has sparked between Michael Cohen, a top executive within the Trump Organization, and Dr. Ali Guy, an NYU physician, over a rented Hamptons luxury home. Cohen claims he had negotiated a 150,000 agreement with the professor to secure the vacation property during August, in hopes of providing a comfortable retreat for his family. However, Cohen's expectations were shattered when the house failed to deliver several key amenities promised in their agreement. Upon arriving at the residence on August 2, Cohen and his family found the air conditioning units were not functional. Furthermore, he found the beds in the home were allegedly too small for his family's needs. In response to the property's numerous shortcomings, Cohen sued Dr. Guy for a sum of 250,000, alleging the professor had \\"ruined his summer.\\" According to the lawsuit, Cohen claims the property's issues prevented him and his family from enjoying a relaxing vacation, which was the main motivation behind renting the high-end Hamptons home. The property in question, known for its luxurious features and prime location, is valued at approximately 8 million. Situated within the upscale community of the Hamptons, the home attracts affluent renters seeking a lavish summer escape. Despite the home's reputation and immense price tag, Cohen believes it did not provide the comfort and relaxation his family had anticipated. The plaintiff's attorney, Samuel Rosen, revealed that Cohen's party had emphasized the importance of working air conditioning and adequately sized beds to the landlord before finalizing the rental agreement. However, Cohen alleges these concerns were not met, resulting in discomfort and dissatisfaction for his family. This legal dispute highlights the high stakes at play when dealing in luxury real estate rentals. The increasingly competitive vacation rental market is no stranger to conflicts between tenants and landlords. In this case, the disagreement could result in a significant financial loss or tarnished reputation for either party. As the lawsuit progresses, the case will shed light on the potential repercussions from renting luxury properties and might serve as a cautionary tale for both landlords and renters alike.

Britain's third biggest grocery chain is to take its battle into the courtroom by requesting a judicial review against a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that rejected its complaint over the Tesco pledge. The move comes after Sainsbury's lost an appeal against the ASA decision earlier this month, when a report by the watchdog's independent reviewer Sir Hayden Philips backed the ASA findings. Sir Hayden agreed with the ASA, although he said OPTIONS: - ASA's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Advertising Standards Authority's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Britain's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Hayden Philips's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Price Promise's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Sainsbury's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Sam Webb's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Supermarket Sainsbury's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Tesco's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues.","completion":"- Advertising Standards Authority's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the terms - In this case, we need to find a controversial process that involves a combination of 'proppant,' 'slickwater' or gel/foam, and various additives like hydrochloric acid, guar gum, and radioactive tracers. Step 2: Analyze the terms for relevant connections - 'Proppant' is a term used in oil and gas extraction processes. It refers to a solid material, usually sand, that keeps fractures open to allow the flow of oil or gas. - 'Slickwater' is a term describing a watery mixture that is often used in hydraulic fracturing processes. It is combined with proppant and other additives to lower the friction and create conditions for a smoother flow. - Additives such as hydrochloric acid, guar gum, and radioactive tracers are commonly used in hydraulic fracturing. Step 3: Make a connection - Based on the information from the analysis, it seems that all the terms mentioned are used in the process of hydraulic fracturing. Step 4: Present the answer - The controversial process that uses a 'proppant' with 'slickwater' or gel/foam including additives such as hydrochloric acid, guar gum, and radioactive tracers is hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking.

The proposals, set out by global financial regulators are designed to avoid the need for taxpayers to bail out the banks in a future crisis. Instead investors will be required to accept a loss on their investments. Leaders of the G20 group of nations will be asked to endorse the reforms. Under the proposals drawn up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), chaired by UK Bank of England governor Mark Carney, banks will be required to issue \\"buffer bonds\\" by 2019 equivalent to 16% of the risk-weighted assets they hold, rising to 18% in 2022. Such assets can include government debt and cash. In the event of a financial crisis the value of those bonds could be written down and used to raise funds for the bank. As a result investors in those bonds would bear the burden of keeping the bank solvent by taking a \\"haircut\\" or loss on their investments. The reform means investors will be the first to take a financial loss before taxpayers are asked to bail out the bank in question. The \\"buffer bonds\\" are the last major reform to be announced by the FSB since the G20 tasked it with introducing changes to the regulate the banking industry in 2009. The FSB has since increased bank capital requirements and imposed restrictions on bankers' bonuses. Mr Carney said many key reforms have already been implemented. \\"As a consequence, the financing capacity to the real economy is being rebuilt and significant retrenchment from international activity has been avoided,\\" Mr Carney said in a letter to G20 leaders ahead of their summit next week. The FSB believes the reforms will allow a big bank to fail without creating the level of panic in financial markets after Lehman Brothers went under in 2008. The \\"buffer bonds\\", known as Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity or TLAC, are on top of the minimum core capital requirements a bank must already hold. The FSB is also assessing the risks to financial stability from the activities of big asset managers and said it would publish recommendations \\"as necessary in the first half of 2016\\".

The answer should address the following factors mentioned in the passage: 1. Alien surroundings: The passage suggests that the unfavorable environment in central and eastern Europe made it difficult for Jews to assimilate. 2. Contempt: Despite some assimilation taking place, contempt from their surroundings had a limiting impact on Jewish assimilation. 3. Living in shtetls: Jews primarily lived in small, isolated communities, which made it difficult for them to assimilate into the larger society. 4. Strong system of education for males: The importance placed on education allowed the Jews to maintain their cultural identity and resist assimilation. 5. Rabbinic leadership: Jewish communities adhered to their religious leaders, which allowed them to preserve their customs and traditions. 6. Scorn for the life-style of their neighbors: Jews were not attracted to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish neighbors, which reduced their motivation to assimilate. 7. Antisemitism: Every outbreak of antisemitism further strengthened the Jews' desire to maintain their distinct identity and resist assimilation.

The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\\" Question: What is David Chadwell's attitude towards separating primary boys and girls while learning? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Supportive.\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"Supportive.\\" David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education, expresses a supportive attitude towards separating primary boys and girls while learning. He provides a number of reasons for this, including the different ways boys and girls learn, see, hear, and react to their environments. He emphasizes that understanding and applying these differences could maximize learning."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Input: Ryu is a deaf-mute man working in a factory. His ailing sister is in desperate need of a kidney transplant, but Ryu's is not a match. After he is laid off from his job, Ryu takes his severance money and contacts a black market organ dealer to exchange one of his kidneys for one that his sister can use. The dealers disappear after taking Ryu's kidney and money. Three weeks later, Ryu learns from his doctor that a donor has been found, but he is unable to afford the operation.To raise money for the operation, Yeong-mi, Ryu's radical anarchist girlfriend, suggests kidnapping the daughter of an executive that fired Ryu. They kidnap Yu-sun, the young daughter of Dong-jin. The girl stays with Ryu's sister, who believes Ryu is merely babysitting her. Ryu and Yeong-mi successfully collect the ransom from Dong-jin. However, Ryu's sister discovers the plan and commits suicide to stop being a burden to him.Ryu takes Yu-sun and his sister's body to a suburban riverbed they used to frequent as children, and begins to bury her. Distracted by the burial and unable to hear, Ryu is unaware when Yu-sun slips into the river, and she drowns.As Dong-jin mourns his daughter, he hires an investigator to find her kidnappers. Dong-jin finds Yeong-mi and tortures her. She apologizes for Yu-sun's death, but warns Dong-jin that her friends (a terrorist group) will kill him if she dies. Unfazed by the threats, Dong-jin electrocutes her. Meanwhile, Ryu locates and murders the organ dealers. He returns to Yeong-mi's apartment and sees the police removing her corpse.Ryu and Dong-jin wait at each other's residence in an attempt to kill the other. Ryu, the first to return home, is knocked unconscious by Dong-jin's booby trap.

Plot title: The Peacemaker Movie plot: The movie begins in an Eastern Orthodox church in Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina, when an unidentified man (later revealed to be a Bosnian diplomat to the UN) is murdered in an alley after receiving a page to meet someone outside.The scene then immediately shifts to a missile base in Chelyabinsk, Russia, where SS-18 ICBM's are being decommissioned. Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity. The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US government.Even though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) is not convinced: SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately. She believes that terrorists are behind the incident. Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her. He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe (Clooney), and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board. A call to Devoe's long time friend and Russian counterpart, Dmitri Vertekoff (Armin Mueller-Stahl), adds credence to his hypothesis.Kelly and Devoe try to track down the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia.

Select from: (I) unacceptable (II) acceptable","completion":"I would rate this sentence as (II) acceptable from a linguistic standpoint, but it may require clarification for some listeners or readers. The sentence possesses the necessary components to demonstrate a complete thought, including a subject (the president), verb (appointed), direct object (press secretary), and indirect object (Smith). The parts of speech are used correctly, and the sentence adheres to typical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in the English language. Moreover, there is no glaring issue with grammar, syntax, or semantics. However, it is essential to note that this rating does not preclude any ambiguity in the sentence. The primary concern here is the usage of \\"press secretary\\" and \\"Smith.\\" The phrasing could imply that the president appointed Smith as the press secretary or that they assigned one press secretary to Smith, who might have another position. The sentence's ambiguity could be clarified by adding the appropriate preposition or rephrasing the sentence structure. If the sentence is meant to convey that the president appointed Smith as the press secretary, it could be revised to: \\"The president appointed Smith as the press secretary\\" or \\"The president made Smith the press secretary.\\" Alternatively, if the sentence aims to express that the president assigned a press secretary to Smith, who holds another position, it could be restructured as: \\"The president appointed a press secretary for Smith\\" or \\"The president assigned a press secretary to Smith.\\" In conclusion, while a linguist may rate the sentence as acceptable, it may still benefit from additional context or revision to avoid any potential confusion or misinterpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ZDF is financed by television licence fees and advertising revenues. - A nature reserve (natural reserve, bioreserve, (natural/nature) preserve or (national/nature) conserve) is a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora, fauna or features of geological or other special interest, which is reserved and managed for conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research. Nature reserves may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws. - Cousin Island is a small granitic island of the Seychelles, lying west of Praslin. It is a nature reserve protected under Seychelles law as a Special Reserve. It is managed by Nature Seychelles, a national nonprofit organization and Partner of BirdLife International, by which it has been identified as an Important Bird Area. - Constantine Walter Benson OBE (England, 2 February 1909 Cambridge, England, 21 September 1982) was a British ornithologist and author of over 350 publications. He is considered the last of a line of British Colonial officials that made significant contributions to ornithology. - A wildlife refuge, also called a wildlife sanctuary, is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection for species from hunting, predation or competition; it is a protected area, a geographic territory within which wildlife is protected. - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - The Comoros ('), officially the Union of the Comoros (Comorian: \\"Udzima wa Komori,\\" , '), is a sovereign archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar.

The Union of the Comoros has three official languages Comorian, Arabic and French. The religion of the majority of the population is Islam. - A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid. The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting, thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax. - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011. - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. - Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles or designatory letters, are letters placed after a person's name to indicate that that individual holds a position, academic degree, accreditation, office, military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it. - Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London.

The 115-island country, whose capital is Victoria, lies east of mainland East Africa. Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros, Mayotte (region of France), Madagascar, Réunion (region of France) and Mauritius to the south. With a population of roughly 92,000, it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country; however, it does have a larger population than the British overseas territory Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Mainz is the capital and largest city of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. It was the capital of the Electorate of Mainz at the time of the Holy Roman Empire. In antiquity Mainz was a Roman fort city which commanded the west bank of the Rhine and formed part of the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire; it was founded as a military post by the Romans in the late 1st century BC and became the provincial capital of Germania Superior. The city is located on the river Rhine at its confluence with the Main opposite Wiesbaden, in the western part of the Frankfurt Rhine-Main; in the modern age, Frankfurt shares much of its regional importance. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s). - Malcolm Penny is a British zoologist who is known for his ornithological field work on Aldabra and the Seychelles .

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the given premise, we need to break down the elements involved in the statement and examine them closely. Premise: Chithirai Vishu (Hindu New Year) is a more religious affair than the Chinese, with worship and prayers. Hypothesis: The Chinese new year is less significant than the Hindu new year. The premise suggests that Chithirai Vishu, the Hindu New Year, has a higher degree of religious involvement compared to the Chinese New Year, mainly through worship and prayers. However, the significance of a celebration is a broader concept that encompasses various aspects such as cultural, historical, social, and economic dimensions, apart from the religious aspect. While the premise focuses on the religious aspect of both New Year celebrations, it doesn't provide any information about the other aspects, which also contribute to the overall significance of the respective celebrations. Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, is abundant with cultural and historical elements. It's a time of family reunions, honoring ancestors, giving gifts, and feasting. The customs and traditions associated with the Chinese New Year are deeply rooted in the society and are celebrated with great enthusiasm. Similarly, Chithirai Vishu or the Hindu New Year carries its importance not only in religious practices but also in cultural, traditional, and social aspects. It is a time of new beginnings, cleaning homes, and welcoming prosperity. Worshipping and praying to deities form just one part of this celebration. Based on the premise, it's true that Chithirai Vishu seems to have a more significant religious component than the Chinese New Year. However, this alone cannot lead to the conclusion that the Chinese New Year is less significant overall than the Hindu New Year. The hypothesis would be valid if we specify that it's based on the religious aspect alone, but it's essential to consider other aspects to make an accurate comparison. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis as it only compares the religious aspect of both the New Year celebrations. To establish the validity of the hypothesis, one would have to dive deeper into the cultural, social, historical, and economic aspects of both celebrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Toamasina , meaning \\"like salt\\" or \\"salty\\", unofficially and in French also Tamatave, is the capital of the Atsinanana region on the east coast of Madagascar on the Indian Ocean. The city is the chief seaport of the country, situated northeast of its capital and biggest city Antananarivo, near the centre of the eastern coast at 18 10 S, 49 32 E. According to the 2013 official estimate, Toamasina had a population of 274,667. The city is served by Toamasina Airport. - Toamasina Airport is an airport in Toamasina, Atsinanana Region, Madagascar . - Atsinanana is a region in eastern Madagascar. It borders Analanjirofo region in north, Alaotra-Mangoro in west, Vakinankaratra and Amoron'i Mania in southwest and Vatovavy-Fitovinany in south. - Pope Benedict XV (Latin: \\"Benedictus XV\\"), born Giacomo Paolo Giovanni Battista della Chiesa (21 November 1854 22 January 1922), was Pope from 3 September 1914 until his death in 1922. His pontificate was largely overshadowed by World War I and its political, social and humanitarian consequences in Europe. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Antananarivo (or ), then temporarily French Tananarive (or ), also known by its French colonial shorthand form Tana, is the capital city of Madagascar. It's also the largest city in Madagascar. The larger urban area surrounding the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (\\"Antananarivo-Mother Hill\\" or \\"Antananarivo-Capital\\"), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city is located above the sea level in the center of the island, and has been the island's largest population center since at least the 18th century. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface).

Benedict's election occurred in a papal conclave following the death of Pope John Paul II. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released in mid 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album--\\"One of Us Must Know ( Recognizing Dylan's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: \\"Grossman came up to me and said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'\\". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966. In addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles--partitions separating the musicians so that there was \\"an ambience fit for an ensemble\\". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, \\"as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart\\". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions. On the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded \\"Visions of Johanna\\", which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of \\"4th Time Around\\" which made it onto the album and a take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" which did not. On February 15 the session began at 6 p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4 a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition \\"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\". Kenny Buttrey recalled, \\"If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it ... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel ... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?\\" The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album. The next session began similarly--Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\\". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did they do when thhey go to e nashville?","completion":"When they got to Nashville, producer Bob Johnston recruited additional musicians including harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey.

Specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations. A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses. While donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against RSV, the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products (p ≤ 0.01 to p ≤ 0.001). To consider this as a donor-specific attribute, 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the RSV antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers: donors with high RSV titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses.

Birthright citizenship in the United States is acquired by virtue of the circumstances of birth. It contrasts with citizenship acquired in other ways, for example by naturalization. Birthright citizenship may be conferred by jus soli or jus sanguinis. Under United States law, U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to any person born within and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This includes the territories of Puerto Rico, the Marianas (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands), and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and also applies to children born elsewhere in the world to U.S. citizens (with certain exceptions). Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: are you a us citizen if born in the us? Options: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"B). yes; Birthright citizenship in the United States is acquired by virtue of the circumstances of birth. Under United States law, U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to any person born within and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This means that if you are born in the US, you are a US citizen. This principle is based on the concept of jus soli, which grants citizenship to individuals born on the soil of a country, regardless of their parents' citizenship status. In addition to the continental United States, this also applies to those born in the US territories, including Puerto Rico, the Marianas (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands), and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It's important to note that the United States is not unique in its implementation of birthright citizenship; many other countries also grant citizenship based on jus soli. However, some nations rely on a different principle called jus sanguinis, in which citizenship is primarily determined by the nationality of one's parents, rather than the location of birth. In some cases, a combination of both jus soli and jus sanguinis may be applied. In the United States, birthright citizenship is established under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states that \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" This amendment was adopted in 1868 to nullify the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which held that people of African descent could not be considered citizens, whether they were born free or into slavery. The 14th Amendment thus clarified and expanded the founding principles of the United States to ensure that citizenship would be granted without regard to race or origin. Beyond jus soli, children born abroad to US citizens may also acquire citizenship at birth through the principle of jus sanguinis. This means that even if a child is not born on US soil, they can still become a US citizen if at least one of their parents is a US citizen. However, there are certain exceptions and requirements that must be met, depending on the parents' marital status, the citizen parent's physical presence in the United States, and the relevant legislation in place at the time of the child's birth. In conclusion, if you are born in the United States, you are granted US citizenship by virtue of birthright citizenship, making option B the correct answer. This principle is based on the constitutional provision found in the 14th Amendment, which ensures that all persons born within the jurisdiction of the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents' nationality or origin."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

Now, let's consider the conclusion: \\"Nickelodeon focuses on programming that is meant to appeal to young adults.\\" By examining the information provided, we can see that Nickelodeon primarily targets children and teenagers. However, young adults typically refer to individuals aged between 18 and 24, which goes beyond the demographic mentioned. Therefore, it might not be accurate to draw the conclusion that Nickelodeon focuses on programming that is meant to appeal to young adults. Instead, we can conclude that Nickelodeon focuses on programming meant to appeal to children and teenagers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

L'utilisation de la force en tant que dernière option reflète l'importance accordée à la résolution pacifique des conflits et au respect des principes du droit international qui régissent les relations entre les États. L'Article 2, paragraphe 4 de la Charte des Nations Unies établit clairement que les membres de l'Organisation doivent s'abstenir dans leurs relations internationales de recourir à la menace ou à l'emploi de la force contre l'intégrité territoriale ou l'indépendance politique de tout État, ou de toute autre manière incompatible avec les buts des Nations Unies. Il existe cependant des circonstances dans lesquelles l'utilisation de la force peut être considérée comme légitime et justifiée, notamment en réponse à une agression armée, avec l'accord préalable du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies ou en exercice du droit inaliénable de légitime défense individuelle ou collective. Dans ces cas, les États doivent agir conformément aux principes du droit international humanitaire et respecter les normes établies en matière de proportionnalité, de nécessité et de précaution. De plus, les États membres des Nations Unies ont la responsabilité de protéger les populations de génocide, de crimes de guerre, de nettoyage ethnique et de crimes contre l'humanité, et le Conseil de sécurité peut, le cas échéant, autoriser l'utilisation de la force pour mettre fin à de telles situations. Néanmoins, en vertu des dispositions de la Charte et du droit international, le recours à la force doit toujours être considéré comme le dernier moyen possible, après avoir épuisé toutes les autres options diplomatiques et pacifiques pour résoudre un conflit ou prévenir une violation grave du droit international. En résumé, bien que l'Article 2, paragraphe 4, de la Charte des Nations Unies interdise l'utilisation de la force dans les relations internationales, il est important de tenir compte des exceptions reconnues et des responsabilités partagées par les États membres pour garantir la paix, la sécurité et la protection des droits de l'homme dans le monde.

Her plan is to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. Once there, Simón claims that he sees a friend named Tomás, whom he draws as a child wearing a sack mask. Later, Benigna, the social worker (Montserrat Carulla), visits the orphanage and tells Laura that she has Simón's adoption file. Laura becomes angry at Benigna's intrusion and sends her away. That night, Laura finds Benigna snooping around her garden shed, but Benigna escapes before Laura can confront her. Later, Simon teaches Laura a type of scavenger hunt game that Tomás taught him. The game involves hiding a person's possessions, with the player who recovers his final possession winning a wish. While playing the game, Laura discovers Simón's adoption file is missing and angrily accuses Simón of hiding it. An angry Simón denies this and says that Tomás told him that Laura is not his real mother and that he is going to die.Later, at a children's party at the Orphanage, Laura and Simón argue, and Simón hides from Laura.

Q:U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said.

This movie catches a lot of flak, but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered / clothed version of the film that played US television and has also been issued to death on VHS and DVD buy companies like Alpha, Unicorn, etc. This movie never had a theatrical release in the states, although it was picked up by Avco Embassy in 1973. In Spain at the time, when there was nudity involved, the filmmakers shot two versions, one with clothes and one with out. The fully uncut English dubbed export print was titled WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS and seems to have been released to home video only in Sweden back in the 80's. It can be found on Ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended. My guess is Avco cut the film down for a R rated release that never happened. In 1974 it was released by Avco to television titled FURY OF THE WOLFMAN and the clothed version was used for this TV print. Cut to 12 years later and FURY OF THE WOLFMAN pops up on home video on the Charter label. This version appears to be what Avco was going to release back in '73. It's the uncovered version, with some nudity that would never pass on TV or in a PG movie. There are several scenes on the Charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the TV print ( the source for all those dollar Dud's and VHS editions ). But a comparison to the fully uncut WOLFMAN NEVER SLEEPS reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version! ( spoilers in next paragraph ) The scene where Ilona has Waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete. After whipping him into submission, she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf!!! The werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too. This scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat. It's not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for US audiences, or more likely the MPAA. Ilona is desperately in love with Waldemar and could not possess him, hence her whole scheme to mind control Waldermar's wife and involve her in an affair. She wanted to wreck his marriage, and she accomplishes this while Waldemar is in Tibet. Unfortunately he returns a werewolf, but this does not slow her down a bit. If she can't physically have him as a man, she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf. This also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window. This scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense. In the uncut version, it would seem Ilona's affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release, so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping. The other cut is a complete scene of Waldemar in bed with Karen and she is seen naked. A very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the US version of WEREWOLF SHADOW ( WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN ) as well. The film does have it's problems though, for certain. The director was drunk, the bad stand in for the werewolf at points, the atrocious English dubbing, the inclusion of sequences from the first Waldemar film MARK OF THE WOLFMAN aka FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR and the grotesque overuse of that film's music score throughout etc, but seen in it's original widescreen format and uncut ( ie: WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS ) it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the Daninsky werewolf series, with a plot line unmatched in it's everything but the kitchen sink approach. The cut / clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors, and unfortunately that's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen. The film carries a 1970 copyright, and I'd bet the 1972 release date on the IMDb is incorrect. The film precedes WEREWOLF SHADOW ( aka WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN ) in the series and was certainly released before WEREWOLF SHADOW. The ending of WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS / FURY OF THE WOLFMAN dovetails directly into the opening of WEREWOLF SHADOW, offering concrete evidence of this. Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release. A perfect release would be the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles. The English dubbing severely hurts the movie. But any Spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in Spain during the Franco era, where nudity was verboten. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mixed. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's flaws, such as the drunk director, poor dubbing, and overuse of music score from another film, but they also express appreciation for the uncut version (WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS) and its wild and outrageous plot line. The reviewer seems to suggest that any negative reception the film has received is mainly due to the release of the cut and covered versions, which do not do justice to the original film. They appear to wish for an ideal release with the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles, which might not ever happen."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Does word \\"snap\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? To snap a whip. The pipe snapped.","completion":"First, let's examine the meaning of the word \\"snap\\" in both sentences: 1. To snap a whip: In this context, the word \\"snap\\" refers to the action of making the whip move quickly, causing a cracking sound. This is the result of the whip's tip breaking the sound barrier. The definition of \\"snap\\" in this case can be considered as \\"to make something produce a sharp cracking sound by moving it quickly\\". 2. The pipe snapped: In this context, the word \\"snap\\" refers to the action of the pipe suddenly breaking or fracturing. This definition can be considered as \\"to break or cause something to break suddenly and completely, typically with a sharp cracking sound\\". Now, let's compare the two meanings: In both cases, the word \\"snap\\" conveys some level of suddenness and is associated with a sharp cracking sound. However, there is a difference in the nature of the action in both sentences. In the first sentence, \\"snap\\" refers to the action of deliberately causing a sound by manipulating an object (the whip). In the second sentence, \\"snap\\" refers to an unintended or unexpected breakage of the object (the pipe). In conclusion, even though the word \\"snap\\" shares some similarities in both contexts, it has a slightly different meaning in each sentence.

To do that, we'll add 55 to both sides of the equation: -5 * h - 55 + 55 = 0 + 55 This simplifies to: -5 * h = 55 Now we are almost there! We just need to find out what h is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -5: (-5 * h) / -5 = 55 / -5 This will give us the value of h: h = -11 So the answer to the math problem is h = -11."},{"prompt":"Generate a question that has the following answer: To find her father with only a photo of him. for the following movie plot: Mexico[edit] Priciliano, the first boy introduced in the story, has a very strong bond with his father.

While the app does bring a fresh approach to managing notifications compared to the traditional lock screen, it falls short in several critical aspects. Firstly, the customization options are quite limited in the free version, forcing users to consider upgrading to the premium version to access basic features. This restriction makes it challenging to truly personalize the app to one's preferences and leaves the app feeling like a stripped-down version, rather than a robust product. Secondly, I continually experienced performance issues with com.achep.acdisplay. The app frequently lagged when swiping away notifications, leading to unintentional taps on messages and opening the corresponding apps. Additionally, there were times the app failed to display notifications altogether, which left me questioning its reliability. Lastly, the battery consumption of this app is significantly higher than expected. Many users, including myself, have noticed faster battery drain when using com.achep.acdisplay. This is a significant concern, as the app serves as a primary notification manager and would be used multiple times a day.

The candidate pledge is titled \\"The Marriage Vow - A Declaration of Dependence Upon Marriage and FAMiLY\\". The purpose of The Marriage Vow is to have on record the personal convictions of each presidential candidate as it relates to the issue of marriage. The signing of the pledge will be a requirement for future endorsement by The FAMiLY LEADER.

The Marriage Vow also outlines support for the legal advocacy for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), humane efforts to protect women and children, rejection of anti-women Sharia Islam, safeguards for all married and unmarried U.S. military personnel, and commitment to downsizing government and the burden upon American families. Bob Vander Plaats, President & CEO of The FAMiLY LEADER, said, \\"We are intentional about the opportunity to take another step in fulfilling our mission to 'Strengthen Families' by providing The Marriage Vow to presidential candidates. The FAMiLY LEADER views this pledge as an important component needed to inform constituents about the personal stand that each presidential candidate takes regarding marriage.

THE MARRIAGE VOW A Declaration of Dependence upon MARRIAGE and FAMiLY1 Faithful monogamy is at the very heart of a designed and purposeful order - as conveyed by Jewish and Christian Scripture, by Classical Philosophers, by Natural Law, and by the American Founders - upon which our concepts of Creator-endowed human rights, racial justice and gender equality all depend.2 Enduring marital fidelity between one man and one woman protects innocent children, vulnerable women, the rights of fathers, the stability of families, and the liberties of all American citizens under our republican form of government. Our exceptional and free society simply cannot endure without the transmission of personal virtue, from one generation to the next, by means of nurturing, nuclear families comprised of sexually-faithful husbands and wives, fathers and mothers. We acknowledge and regret the widespread hypocrisy of many who defend marriage yet turn a blind eye toward the epidemic of infidelity and the anemic condition of marriages in their own communities. Unmistakably, the Institution of Marriage in America is in great crisis: .. Slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an MricanAmerican baby born after the election of the USA's first Mrican-American President.3 LBJ's 1965 War on Poverty was triggered in part by the famous \\"Moynihan Report\\" finding that the black out-of-wedlock birthrate had hit 26%; today, the white rate exceeds that, the overall rate is 41%, and over 70% of Mrican-American babies are born to single parents4 - a prime sociological indicator for poverty, pathology and prison regardless of race or ethnicity. 5 About one million U.S. children suffer through divorce each year - the outcome of about half of all first marriages and about 60 percent of remarriages, disproportionately affecting economically-vulnerable families.s The taxpayer-borne social costs of family fragmentation exceeds 112 billion per year, especially when all costs to the justice system are recognized.7 Social protections, especially for women and children, have been evaporating as we have collectively \\"debased the currency\\" of marriage. This debasement continues as a function of adultery; \\"quickie divorce;\\" physical and verbal spousal abuse; non-committal co-habitation; exemplary infidelity and \\"unwed cheating\\" among celebrities, sports figures and politicians; anti-scientific bias which holds, in complete absence of empirical proof, that non-heterosexual inclinations are genetically determined, irresistible and akin to innate traits like race, gender and eye color; as well as anti-scientific bias which holds, against all empirical evidence, that homosexual behavior in particular, and sexual promiscuity in general, optimizes individual or public health. 8 .. .. .. .. The Candidate Vow: Therefore, in any elected or appointed capacity by which Lmay have the honor of serving our fellow citizens in these United States, I the undersigned do hereby solemnly vow\\" to honor and to cherish, to defend and to uphold, the Institution of Marriage as only between one man and one woman.

Furthermore, no peer-reviewed empirical science or rational, scholarly demonstration has ever definitively proven, nor even has shown an overwhelming probability: (1) That society's interest in the physical, psychological and sociological health of infants, children, young people and other minors is not best upheld through the enduring institution of legal marriage, especially faithful monogamy, as between only one man and one woman; (2) That society's interest in a healthy, vibrant, and growing indigenous population and workforce to drive economic growth and actuarially support public and private pension, benefit and entitlement systems is in any way advanced by undermining the institution of faithful, lawful marriage as between only one man and one woman; (3) That the longstanding religious liberties of American parents, children, religious and civic leaders who adhere to Jewish and Christian tradition, teaching and sacred texts regarding faithful heterosexual monogamy are not jeopardized by recent or pending redefinitions oflegal marriage to include same-sex unions, polygamy and other kinds of intimate relations; (4) That practices such as adultery, bisexuality, homosexuality, anal intercourse, group sex, promiscuity, serial marriage, polygamy, polyandry and extramarital sex, individually or collectively, lead to general improvements in: a.

No signer herein claims to be without past wrongdoing, including that of adultery. Yet going forward, each hereby vows fidelity to his or her marital vows, to his or her spouse, to all strictures and commandments against adultery, and to resist the lure of pornography destructive to marital intimacy. 10 Personal infidelity often destroys two marriages and two families. \\"It is no secret that a handful of state and federal judges, some of whom have personally rejected heterosexuality and faithful monogamy, have also abandoned bonafide constitutional interpretation in accord with the discernible intent of the framers. In November, 2010, Iowa voters overwhelmingly rejected three such justices from the state Supreme Court in retention elections. Yet, certain federal jurists with lifetime appointments stand poised, even now, to \\"discover\\" a right of so-called same-sex marriage or polygamous marriage in the U.S. Constitution. 12 Justice Scalia's dissent in Lawrence v. Texas (hUn:! !w v.law.comell.edu/supctlhtml/02-102.ZD.html) holds that laws against such things as bigamy/polygamy, prostitution, bestiality, adult incest -- customs historically rejected within the United States -- may become Constitutionally-inevitable under U.S. Supreme Court logic which could be used to invalidate the Defense of Marriage Act and laws, in the overwhelming majority of states, against so-called same-sex marriage and nearequivalents. This is particularly problematic with regard to polygamy, a demographic and strategic means for the advancement of Sharia Islamist misogyny, for attacks upon the rights of women, for the violent persecution of homosexuals, for the undermining of basic human rights, and for general religious and civil intolerance for Jewish, Christian and other non-Islamic faiths under Sharia law. 13 U.S. Bureau of the Census, American Community Survey, 2006-2008; W.

Therefore, we hereby applaud the commitment of Speaker John Boehner and his House Leadership to bring about appropriate legal intervention by the U.S. House of Representatives, in defense of both DOMA and the institution of the Congress itself; a binding act of the Legislative Branch of the federal government has been abandoned for-ideological reasons by the Executive Branch. Forthe event that activist Federal courts orthe U.S. Supreme Court may ultimately strike down DOMA or state laws limiting legal marriage to one man and one woman, the signatories hereby vow to support a Marriage Amendment which would constitutionally define and limit legal marriage or marriage equivalents in the U.S. to one man and one woman, thereby especially protecting American women and children from Sharia polygamy, same-sex unions, and other debasements of Judeo-Christian heteromonogamy. To date, the ONLY states whose elected lawmakers and governors have enacted same-sex marriage onhehalf of their constituentsare: Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. , In all 31 states in which marriage has been putto a vote of the People, same-sex marriage has been defeated and natural marriage has been upheld (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota.Tennessee.Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin). 17 Human trafficking, child pornography and prostitution, .pimping, sexual slavery and forced abortion are inherently coercive of vulnerable females. ,Infanticide and abortion are inherently coercive of the babies who are killed; as a matter of human rights, we reject any form of intrauterine or extrauterine child killing which is partialbirth; live-birth; post-viability; third trimester; involving fetal pain; taxpayer-subsidized; based on gender or disability or racial discrimination against the baby; without fully-informed consent; without disclosure of pregnancy care and adoption placement options; without disclosure of abortion's eugenicandracisthistory;invohing a minor without parental knowledge or consent; in disregard of conscience objections of health care professionals and institutions; involving cloning or experimentation on non-consenting human subjects;involving dangerous abortifacient drugs; orfor.alleged necessities, other than to save the life of the mother. 18 See, e.g., Center for Military Readiness: www.cmrlinkorg/HMilitarv.asp, ,www.cmrlinkorgtWomenlnCombat.asp 19,Wedo ,not oppose peaceful Muslims, only the intolerant system of Sharia Islam: Princeton's Bernard Lewis,dean of Western scholarsofIslam, says, \\"<My own feeling is that the greatest defect of Islam and the main reason they fell behind the West is the treatment of women,' he says.

When it was first circulated last week, the introduction to the pledge stated that African American children were more likely to be raised in two-parent households when they were born into slavery than they are today. The group struck that language and apologized after black ministers complained, but it said it stands by the rest of the document. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Romney, told The Associated Press in a written statement Tuesday that Romney \\"strongly supports traditional marriage,\\" but that the oath \\"contained references and provisions that were undignified and inappropriate for a presidential campaign.\\" Bachmann and Santorum have been campaigning hard to court the influential social conservatives in Iowa, which holds the nation's first caucuses. Romney's rejection of the pledge reflects his diminished focus on winning Iowa, where he spent 10 million during his 2008 presidential campaign only to finish second. None of the other GOP presidential hopefuls, including former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have said whether they will sign the pledge or not. Romney, who supported rights for gay couples in Massachusetts, was criticized in Iowa by some Iowa social conservatives during his 2008 campaign, when he finished second in the caucuses after aggressively courting Christian conservatives. In his second bid, Romney, who leads in national GOP polls, has cast himself as a national figure more focused on the economy, and has said he would not spend as much time and money campaigning in Iowa as he did during his 10 million effort for the 2008 caucuses. The Family Leader, an organization formed last year and positioning itself to be an influential player in the 2012 caucuses, said Tuesday they stand by the 14 policy positions listed under the promise to \\"defend and to uphold the institution of marriage as only between one man and one woman.\\" The points include the promise to be faithful to their spouses, enforce the federal Defense of Marriage Act and support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. The group said signing the oath is a condition of winning its endorsement before the caucuses. \\"We are standing firm that the 14 points of the marriage vow are right on target and we are creating higher standards for the presidential candidates,\\" said Julie Summa, director of marketing and public outreach for The Family Leader. \\"We are not backing away from that at all.\\" Gay marriage has been a volatile issue in Iowa in recent years, and came to a head in 2009 when the Iowa Supreme Court struck down the state's statutory ban on gay marriage, making same-sex marriages legal. Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman is not campaigning in Iowa, citing his past opposition to farm subsidies, although he also supported rights for same-sex couples as governor of Utah. Huntsman campaign aides said Tuesday the former U.S. ambassador to China is declining to sign any pledges as part of his campaign. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"According to a comprehensive survey conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and commissioned by the Alliance Defense Fund, 62% of Americans believe that \\"marriage should be defined only as a union between one man and one woman.\\" The research, which aimed to examine American attitudes towards marriage, included 14 focus groups and a national survey of 1,500 Americans.

Can you tell me the answer to the egg of an animal is most like which part of a plant??","completion":"In order to determine which part of a plant is most similar to the egg of an animal, I will first analyze and compare the function and structure of animal eggs to the reproductive structures of plants. Step 1: Evaluating the function of an animal egg An animal egg, or ovum, contains genetic material from the female parent and serves as the starting point for the development of a new organism. The egg provides nutrients, protection, and a supportive environment for the developing embryo. Step 2: Analyzing plant reproductive structures Plants have different reproductive structures, depending on whether they reproduce sexually or asexually. For sexual reproduction, plants typically have specialized organs called flowers, which contain the sexual reproductive cells. The female reproductive structure in a flower is the pistil, which includes the ovary, style, and stigma. The male reproductive structure is the stamen, which contains the anther and filament. Inside the ovary, there are ovules that contain the egg cells. Step 3: Comparing animal and plant structures In terms of reproductive function and structure, the most similar part in plants to an animal egg is the ovule. Both animal egg and ovule contain the female genetic material and will later develop into a new organism (embryo in animals, seed in plants) after fertilization. The ovule in a plant serves a similar purpose as an animal egg in that it contains the female genetic material and, upon fertilization, develops into a seed that houses a new plant embryo. Like an animal egg, the ovule provides an environment conducive to embryonic development, offering protection and nutrient resources. So, the most similar part of a plant to an egg of an animal is the ovule within the ovary of a flower."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- What is it with juries in high-profile cases in Southern California? Over the years, they've become a national joke. But no one is laughing. Instead, with each travesty of justice and every acquittal that should have been a conviction, you're left wondering just what trial these 12 folks were watching and questioning whether we should have higher standards for who sits on a jury. Sometimes, the juries in local and state courts get it wrong, and the Justice Department must step in and make it right. Think back to the acquittal in April 1992 of four Los Angeles police officers who, one year earlier, savagely beat motorist Rodney King. They walked out of a courtroom in Simi Valley, California, as free men -- sparking days of rioting, looting and violence. In","completion":"response to the growing concerns surrounding jury decisions in high-profile cases, legislators and legal experts in Southern California are considering implementing new measures to ensure fair and unbiased trials. Potential changes may include more rigorous juror screening processes, additional jury instruction, and alternating the locations of high-profile trials to avoid potential influences from local communities. Critics argue that such measures may only slow down the already lengthy legal process and potentially infringe on defendants' rights to a fair trial. However, proponents believe that addressing the apparent discrepancies in juror deliberations, particularly in high-stakes cases, is necessary to maintain public faith in the justice system and to prevent further incidents of civil unrest. As the debate continues, several committees have been established to review recent high-profile acquittals and analyze juror behavior. These committees aim to identify patterns, biases, and areas for improvement in the current jury system. Their findings and recommendations will ultimately guide future policy changes in the legal system. In conclusion, while jury decisions in high-profile cases in Southern California have sparked various concerns, governments and legal experts are now actively working on potential solutions to address these issues. Whether these changes will improve the quality of jury decisions and restore public confidence in the justice system remains to be seen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the beginning, Tanya had suspicions about Emily's possible involvement in the death of the cat. With her deep-seated belief in animal rights and her experience with investigating similar cases, Tanya started building a case against Emily. She began by collecting evidence, speaking with various eye-witnesses, and analyzing the crime scene. The witnesses at the park had given consistent accounts of seeing Emily near the dead cat. Some of them even claimed they saw her carrying a suspicious bag at the time the cat went missing. However, Tanya knew she needed concrete proof before confronting Emily. Tanya then sought help from a local veterinarian, who was able to examine the deceased cat and give more information about the cause of death. The veterinarian explained that the cat had ingested some form of poison. Suddenly, the pieces started falling into place, and Tanya wondered if the suspicious bag Emily was carrying contained the lethal substance. Further investigation led Tanya to discover Emily's motive for poisoning the cat. Tanya found out that Emily had a long-standing feud with the cat's owner, which fueled her theory that Emily could have committed the act as an act of revenge stemming from this unresolved dispute. With this newly found evidence, Tanya decided to confront Emily. She began by asking her questions about the dead cat, hoping to gain insight into her motives and actions. However, Tanya was cautious not to expose the extent of her findings at the outset, instead opting to observe Emily's responses to her questions. Initially, Emily feigned ignorance and claimed to have no knowledge about the cat's death. However, as Tanya continued to inquire and subtly hinted at her knowledge of the feud with the cat's owner, Emily's confidence waned, and her responses became more evasive. While Emily never directly admitted to her involvement in the death of the cat, her reactions and responses to Tanya's questions only served to solidify Tanya's initial suspicions. Encouraged by the evidence she had amassed, Tanya planned to present her findings to the authorities, with the hope that they would launch a formal investigation into the matter. In summary, Tanya's thorough inquiry and strong evidence led her to confront Emily about the dead cat found at the corner of the park. This confrontation brought to light Emily's potential involvement, motives, and actions, ultimately paving the way for an eventual investigation by the proper authorities. The sentence perfectly encapsulates Tanya's preparedness and determination to uncover the truth behind the cat's tragic demise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the following context: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide?

Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, more than 4000 years ago. The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation. The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River. This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas, and Hindu Shahi.

Problem:Isorhamnetin is one member of flavonoid components which has been used in the treatment of heart disease. Recently the in vitro anti-cancer effect of isorhamnetin on human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca-109 was investigated in our lab. When Eca-109 cells were in vitro exposed to the graded doses of isorhamnetin (0-80 microg/ml) for 48 h, respectively, isorhamnetin exhibited cytostatic effect on the treated cells, with an IC(50) of 40+/-0.08 microg/ml as estimated by MTT assay. Inhibition on proliferation by isorhamnetin was detected by trypan blue exclusion assay, clone formation test, immunocytochemical assay of PCNA and (3)H-thymidine uptake analysis. Cell cycle distribution was measured by FCM. It was found that the viability of Eca-109 cells was significantly hampered by isorhamnetin. Compared with the negative control group, the treated group which was exposed to isorhamnetin had increased population in G(0)/G(1) phase from 74.6 to 84 while had a significant reduction in G(2)/M phase from 11.9 to 5.8. In addition to its cytostatic effect, isorhamnetin also showed stimulatory effect on apoptosis. Typical apoptotic morphology such as condensation and fragmentation of nuclei and blebbing membrane of the apoptotic cells could be observed through transmission electron microscope. Moreover, the sharp increase in apoptosis rate between the control and treated group were detected by FCM from 6.3 to 16.3. To explore the possible molecular mechanisms that underlie the growth inhibition and apoptosis stimulatory effects of isorhamnetin, the expressions of six proliferation- and death-related genes were detected by FCM. Expressions of bcl-2, c-myc and H-ras were downregulated whereas Bax, c-fos and p53 were upregulated. However, the in vivo experiments were required to further confirm the anti-cancer effects of isorhamnetin. In conclusion, isorhamnetin appears to be a potent drug against esophageal cancer due to its in vitro potential to not only inhibit proliferation but also induce apoptosis of Eca-109 cells.

A:","completion":"Alfred Bester and Iain Banks can be classified as science fiction authors who have made significant contributions to the genre through their imaginative and thought-provoking works. Both of these authors have carved their own niche within the vast realm of science fiction, leaving a lasting impact on readers and inspiring countless other authors and creators in the science fiction community. Alfred Bester (1913-1987) was an American science fiction author, best known for his novels \\"The Demolished Man\\" (1953) and \\"The Stars My Destination\\" (1956). Bester's writing is characterized by his unique storytelling style and innovative narrative techniques. He was a pioneer in exploring themes such as telepathy, dystopian societies, and the psychological aspects of identity and consciousness. His work often featured complex, deeply flawed characters engaged in morally ambiguous situations and showcased a mastery of blending speculative concepts with elements of noir and mystery. Iain Banks (1954-2013) was a Scottish author who wrote both mainstream fiction and science fiction, the latter under the name Iain M. Banks. In the realm of science fiction, he is best known for the Culture series, which includes novels such as \\"Consider Phlebas\\" (1987), \\"Player of Games\\" (1988), and \\"Use of Weapons\\" (1990). Banks' work is known for its intricate world-building, skillful blend of political and social commentary, and exploration of artificial intelligence and post-human civilizations. The Culture series presents a utopian post-scarcity society made possible by advanced technologies, where humans and machine intelligences coexist in a complex and fascinating universe. Both authors share a common interest in developing intricate plots, exploring engaging ideas, and pushing the boundaries of science fiction. As genre innovators, they have left a profound impact on the evolution of science fiction and have inspired generations of authors who came after them. Alfred Bester and Iain Banks can, therefore, be considered influential, imaginative, and introspective science fiction authors who offer profound insights into human nature and push the frontiers of what is possible within the space of speculative fiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: UPDATE: The Clayton County teen abducted from her home early Tuesday morning has been found, Channel 2 Action News is reporting. Read more about how police found Ayvani Hope Perez and the suspects in the case. ORIGINAL STORY: Ayvani Hope Perez remained missing early Wednesday, more than 24 hours after being kidnapped by armed men who barged into her family’s home. When the two gunmen burst into the Ellenwood home early Tuesday, the mother tried unsuccessfully to hide her two teenage children to protect them. Tuesday evening, family members wre trying to raise a 10,000 ransom to give the men who kidnapped her youngest, 14-year-old Ayvani, after their demand for cash and jewelry went unmet in the robbery attempt. Rarely heard of kidnap ransom demands came from two people who law enforcement officials say were strangers to the family before the home invasion. There remained a heavy police presence Wednesday in the neighborhood just east of I-675 where Tuesday’s home invasion and kidnapping occurred. Two Clayton County police officers stationed at the end of Brookgate Drive were stopping all vehicles and only allowing residents to proceed up the street and closer to the victim’s home. Media, which included crews from Good Morning America and the Today show, were being kept well away from the home by officers. Additional police vehicles, including a mobile command center, were parked in front of the victim’s home. A few neighbors on their way to catch the school bus spoke briefly to reporters about Ayvani. “We talked once or twice,” 11-year-old Zakar McCullough said. “I would see her in her driveway, playing with her brother and her dog. We talked about normal kid stuff.” He said he didn’t talk to Ayvani much “because she was real shy.” “I hope she gets home safe,” he said. “I will pray for her family.” Griselda Torres, 15, called Ayvani “a sweet girl” who loves horses. “Hopefully she’s okay,” she said. “She’s too young and I know she’s scared right now.” Clayton County police Lt. Marc Richards issued the following statement late Wednesday morning: “The Clayton County Police Department would like to express its sincere appreciation for the outpouring of support we have received as we steadfastly work toward bringing Ayvani home safely to her family. Our efforts have not waned. We are committed to the task at hand. To our law enforcement family, remain vigilant. To our media partners, continue to put the message out. To the community, the Tip Line to call with information is 770-477-3513. To the perpetrators of this heinous act, release Ayvani unharmed.” Tuesday evening, more than 150 people gathered in a circle and held hands in prayer at the candle-light vigil at Dutchtown High School in Hampton. Many teens there – holding posters with Ayvani’s name and pictures of them with her – were her class mates from Dutchtown Middle School. “I possibly have a chance to never see her again,” former classmate Nina Richardson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “On so many levels, it just feels so unreal.” Ayvani’s aunt, Suky Guerrero, told the AJC Tuesday that family members were trying to get the money together to secure the teen’s release. The AJC confirmed the ransom demand with a law enforcement official close to the investigation who was unauthorized to speak publicly. Guerrero said she understood the family was still waiting for the money to be delivered late Tuesday. Guerrero took her brother, Ayvani’s father, Alberto Perez, 47, to the airport in El Paso, Texas, to fly to Atlanta on Tuesday morning. “My brother doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t have any money like that.” Perez, she said, wanted to be by the side of his ex-wife, Ayvani’s mother Maria Perez. “He was devastated, not knowing what to do,” Guerrero said. Clayton County Police said the home invasion and subsequent abduction seemed random. “It didn’t appear that they knew each other,” police spokesman Officer Phong Nguyen said of the suspects and victims. “They just moved in about a month ago.” The FBI and GBI are aiding in the search for Ayvani, and authorities are asking for the public’s help to locate the men who drove away in a gray Dodge. The GBI has released sketches of the suspects. Anyone with information on the girl or the suspects should call a special tips hotline at 770-477-3513 or Clayton County police at 678-610-4781. “This is the time for the Clayton community and the community as a whole to come together,” Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter told reporters. “We’re trying to make sure that we bring her some safely.” Late Tuesday afternoon, a quiet buzz took over the Brook Gate subdivision just off I-675 where Ayvani lives. As residents and youth who would be Ayvani’s class mates returned home from school, they were greeted by a phalanx of police and law enforcement and representatives from both local and national media. Some said they were stunned and frightened. “It’s very scary,” said Breyana Walker, a 16-year-old junior at Morrow High School. “I’m so terrified,” said Walker, who lives just down the street from Ayvani. “I feel like I need someone here with me,” she said. “It could happen to anybody. I don’t know what to do.” Maties Otalis, a father of four, who has lived in the neighborhood for two years said he was stunned by the kidnapping. “We always have police around this area,” he said. “I don’t expect such to happen in my neighborhood. I feel like moving out of this area.” Toni Hill, another resident, said neighbors stay to themselves in the area but Tuesday morning’s incident will make her more vigilant. “This situation is just terrifying. We thought we lived in the same neighborhood but we don’t know what’s going on here,” Hill said. - Staff writers Mike Morris, and Rhonda Cook and staff photographer John Spink contributed to this article. ||||| As law enforcement agencies all around Georgia search for 14-year-old kidnapping victim Ayvani Perez, one of her best friends is praying for her safe return. \\"I want to tell her that I love her,\\" said Perez's friend and classmate Ariana Soeun. \\"I hope that she comes home because she knows everybody misses her.\\" A Levi’s Call alert has been posted for Perez, who authorities said was abducted from her family’s Ellenwood home Tuesday about 2 a.m. Police released sketches of the two armed men they believe took her during the home invasion on Brookgate Drive. Police said the mother tried to hide her two children, but the suspects found the family, along with the family’s dog, and demanded money and jewelry. Family members and law enforcement officials said suspects are now demanding a ransom for Perez's safe return, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A friend of Perez told Channel 2's Richard Elliot she's praying for the teen's safe return. Channel 2 Action News has a team of reporters speaking with law enforcement about every possible lead in this case. Despite the fact that she lives in Clayton County, Henry County School officials confirmed Perez is enrolled at Stockbridge High School. Officials also confirmed to Channel 2 Action News that police detectives visited the school Tuesday morning hoping to find some information that might help them locate Perez.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which game was invented in India and played more by children, Pay Day or Aksharit? Answer:","completion":"Aksharit is the game that was invented in India and is played more by children compared to Pay Day. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's delve into the origins, rules, and significance of both games. Aksharit: Aksharit is an Indian board game, specifically designed for young children to learn and engage with the Hindi language. The game was developed by IIT Bombay alumni Rajat Dhariwal, Manuj Dhariwal, and Mohit Gupta, and was launched in 2006. Aksharit is often referred to as the Hindi version of Scrabble, as it borrows some of its gameplay aspects from the English word-building game. In Aksharit, the playing board consists of a grid with cells, and players are given lettered tiles. The aim is to form Hindi words by placing tiles on the board. Each letter tile has a specific point value assigned to it, depending on the frequency of the letter's usage in the language. Players score points based on the letter tiles they use to create words, and bonuses are given when a word is created on special cells (such as double/triple letter scores or double/triple word scores). The game has been widely embraced in India, particularly among children. Aksharit serves an educational purpose, as it helps kids learn the Hindi alphabet, enhance their vocabulary, and improve their language skills. Moreover, it is crafted in such a way that it caters to both native Hindi speakers and those learning Hindi as a second language, hence making it easily accessible for a more diverse group of players. Its popularity in India is a testament to its successful blend of education and entertainment, making it a favored pastime among young learners. Pay Day: On the other hand, Pay Day is an American board game that was created by Paul J. Gruen and first published by Parker Brothers (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) in 1975. Pay Day focuses on teaching children and adults basic financial skills and money management concepts through an engaging, simulation-based gameplay experience. In Pay Day, players move around a board representing a month, where each space corresponds to a specific day. The goal of the game is to have the most money at the end of the month after accounting for various expenses, deals, and transactions that occur throughout the game. Players receive a monthly salary, assume financial responsibilities, and make decisions aimed at increasing their wealth. While Pay Day is designed for players of all ages, it is not as widespread in Indian families. The game's content, including its monetary system and financial themes, is centered around the Western way of life, making it less relatable for Indian children. Moreover, given its focus on financial skills, the game is not primarily aimed at teaching or enhancing language skills, making it less pertinent for children in an Indian context. In conclusion, Aksharit is the game that was invented in India and played more by children, as compared to Pay Day. This can be attributed to Aksharit's relatability to the Indian culture, its educational focus on language learning and vocabulary enrichment, and its accessibility to a diverse group of players, irrespective of their linguistic background."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888 Uprising. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General Saw Maung staged a coup d'état and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country's official English name from the \\"Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\\" to the \\"Union of Myanmar\\" in 1989. Why was marshal law declared in Burma in 1989?","completion":"Martial law was declared in Burma (now Myanmar) in 1989 due to a combination of factors that threatened the stability and control of the ruling military regime. The government, led by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), was facing widespread protests and unrest in the country, stemming from economic mismanagement, political oppression, and a yearning for greater freedom and democracy among the population. This climate of instability and popular dissent ultimately forced the military government to take drastic measures in order to maintain its grip on power and suppress the growing opposition to its rule. One of the key events that led to the declaration of martial law in 1989 was the 8888 Uprising – so named because it reached its peak on the 8th of August, 1988 (8/8/88). This was a series of nationwide protests and demonstrations that challenged the military's rule and called for the establishment of a democratic government. The protests were primarily driven by students, intellectuals, and Buddhist monks, but they soon garnered support from various segments of Burmese society, including workers, farmers, and even some members of the military. The 8888 Uprising posed a significant threat to the SLORC, as it demonstrated that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the military regime and its policies. In response to the protests, the government used force to crack down on dissent, resulting in the deaths of thousands of demonstrators and the imprisonment of many others. However, these repressive measures were not enough to quell the unrest, and the protests continued to grow in intensity and magnitude. As tensions between the government and the opposition intensified, the situation in Burma reached a boiling point in 1989. The SLORC feared that the continued unrest could lead to a complete loss of control and the possible overthrow of the regime. In order to reassert its authority and maintain control of the country, the military government decided to declare martial law, which granted them greater power to arrest, detain, and punish those who were deemed a threat to state security. Martial law allowed the SLORC to take extraordinary measures to suppress the opposition and curtail civil liberties. Under this state of emergency, the government could bypass the country's existing legal system and implement strict measures to control the population, including curfews, restrictions on movement, pervasive surveillance, and the deployment of large numbers of security forces to quash dissent. Through martial law, the SLORC hoped to regain control of the situation and prevent the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people from threatening the survival of the regime. In summary, martial law was declared in Burma in 1989 in response to the escalating unrest and pro-democracy protests throughout the country, which threatened the stability and control of the military government. By implementing martial law, the SLORC sought to reassert its authority, suppress the opposition, and maintain its grip on power in the face of widespread popular dissent. This decision marked a turning point in Burma's political landscape and set the stage for the continued struggle between the military regime and pro-democracy forces in the years that followed."},{"prompt":"Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that was abroad for much of the intervening period of Nuffield? from the following article ? Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPTIONS: [a]. no [b]. yes","completion":"[a]. No Let me explain both questions and their respective answers below: 1. What are the ill effects of demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in India? The Indian Government’s sudden announcement of demonetization of the existing ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes on the night of November 8, 2016, came as a shock to many. The purpose of demonetization was to curb black money, counterfeit notes, and funding of terrorist activities. But, despite the positive intentions, demonetization had multitude ill effects on the Indian economy and its citizens: a. Economic slowdown: The abrupt withdrawal of 86% of the country's currency value in circulation caused a severe cash crunch, leading to a drop in consumer spending, reduced demand for goods and services, and consequently slowing down the economic growth. b. Unemployment: The short-term liquidity crunch impacted labor-intensive sectors like agriculture, textiles, and construction, which caused job losses and reduced income for daily wage earners. c. Disruption of informal sector: The informal sector, accounting for almost half of India's GDP and the majority of employment, was disproportionately affected. Workers in this sector rely heavily on cash transactions, and the lack of available cash disrupted their businesses. d. Impacts on agriculture: Farmers faced difficulties in buying seeds, fertilizers, and other essential agricultural inputs due to the cash crunch, leading to delays in sowing crops and overall agricultural productivity. e. Inconvenience and hardship for the general public: The sudden withdrawal of notes led to long queues outside banks and ATMs, causing severe inconvenience to citizens in their daily economic activities. The elderly and those living in remote areas were particularly hard hit. f. Strain on banking system: The massive demand for cash exchanges and withdrawals burdened banks with increased workload, leading to extended work hours and stress on employees. 2. What is the use of banning 500 and 1000 rupee notes and introducing new 500 and 2000 rupee notes? Demonetization in India involved the replacement of old ₹500 and ₹1000 notes with new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes. The Indian Government cited the following reasons for this decision: a. Curbing black money: By making the older notes illegal tender and requiring the exchange or deposit of old notes into bank accounts, the government aimed to flush out unaccounted wealth and reduce the stock of black money in the economy. b. Combating counterfeit currency: The older notes were more prone to counterfeiting, and the new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes featured better security measures, making it more difficult to fake. c. Striking at terrorist financing: Counterfeit notes were also often used to fund terrorist activities. By rendering the old notes worthless, the government hoped to disrupt the financing of such illegal activities. d. Encouraging digital transactions: With a cash crunch following demonetization, more people had to rely on digital payments and non-cash transactions. This eventually helped promote digital transactions and reduce the economy's reliance on cash. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the same event of demonetization, they are not paraphrases of each other, as the first one asks about the negative consequences, and the second one seeks clarification regarding the purpose and use of this policy."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Mustafa Bülent Ecevit (28 May 1925 5 November 2006) was a Turkish politician, poet, writer, scholar, and journalist, who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey four times between 1974 and 2002. He served as prime minister of Turkey in 1974, 1977, 197879, and 19992002. He was the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) between 1972 and 1980, and in 1989 he became the leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP). - The 15th Turkish general election was held on 3 November 2002 following the collapse of the DSP - MHP - ANAP coalition led by Bülent Ecevit . It was the 15th general election to be held in Turkey . All 550 members of the Grand National Assembly were up for election . The election was held during an ongoing economic crisis which followed the 2001 financial crash , which resulted in a deep resentment of coalition governments which had governed the country since the 1980 military coup . The Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which had only been formed in 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdoan , won the election with nearly two - thirds of the seats . The protest vote was such that every sitting party previously represented in parliament was ejected , with the AKP winning 363 seats with just 34.3 % of the vote . The only other party which passed the 10 % threshold to gain representation was the Republican People 's Party , which came second with 19.38 % of the vote and 178 seats . The election produced Turkey 's first single party government since 1987 and the country 's first two - party parliament since 1960 . The moderate Islamism advocated by the AKP was at odds with the secular establishment of the Republic of Turkey . While serving as the Mayor of Istanbul , Erdoan was sentenced to a 10 month prison term in 1998 for reciting a poem in Siirt which incited racial intolerance . This barred him from initially seeking a seat in parliament , meaning that the AKP 's co-founder Abdullah Gül became Prime Minister following their election victory . With the help of the CHP , the government overturned Erdoan 's political ban in 2003 , after which he was able to seek a seat in a controversial by - election in the Province of Siirt . Erdoan became Prime Minister in March 2003 , with Abdullah Gül concurrently assuming the role of Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister . - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - The Prime Minister of Turkey (Turkish: \\"Babakan\\") is the head of government of Turkey. The prime minister is the leader of a political coalition in the Turkish parliament (Meclis) and the leader of the cabinet. The current holder of the position is Binali Yldrm of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), who took office on 24 May 2016.

Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London.

Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Supernatural fiction or supernaturalist fiction is a genre of literary and media fiction exploiting or requiring as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace natural world and materialist assumptions about it. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. - Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi. It is a parody sequel to the 1981 horror film \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration, \\"Crimewave\\"), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams. - Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847 20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned. - Darkman is a 1990 American superhero film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi. It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is attacked and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney (Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer (Colin Friels). - In works of art, macabre is the quality of having a grim or ghastly atmosphere. Macabre works emphasize the details and symbols of death. The term also refers to works particularly gruesome in nature. - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres. - Scott Spiegel (born December 24, 1957) is an American screenwriter, film director, producer and actor. He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie \\"Evil Dead II\\" with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's \\"Within the Woods\\", which served as a precursor to \\"The Evil Dead\\". - The Evil Dead is a 1981 American supernatural horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the short film \\"Within the Woods\\" as a \\"prototype\\" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US90,000 to produce \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in Morristown, Tennessee, in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the majority of the cast and crew. - Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis. In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia. - Within the Woods is a 1978 horror short film written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film \\"Clockwork\\", deciding to produce a \\"prototype\\" horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for 1600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods. - Clockwork is a 1978 American short horror film directed by Sam Raimi , starring Scott Spiegel and Cheryl Guttridge . - Birmingham is a city in Oakland County of the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Detroit.

Thousands of lives could be saved by a new drug for heart failure that researchers claim outperforms the current best treatments. Clinical trials for the new drug – currently called LCZ696 – were halted early because of the ‘emphatic’ results delivered by the treatment. Research on more than 8,000 patients found that it saved 20 per cent more lives than the current ‘gold standard’ treatment – the ACE inhibitor enalapril. A co-leader of the trial, Professor John McMurray of the University of Glasgow, said: ‘We have what we believe is a much more effective replacement for one of the gold standard drugs for the treatment of heart failure. This is a major advance in the treatment of this terrible problem.’ Heart failure affects almost 900,000 Britons, most of them elderly, and claims 140,000 lives a year. It causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles, and can lead to serious complications. It occurs when the heart cannot pump blood around the body effectively, possibly following a heart attack. The body responds to the low flow of blood by producing hormones such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline. But these hormones constrict blood vessels and actually make it harder for the failing heart to squeeze blood into them. Over time, the constant production of these hormones further damages the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. Enalapril, the current treatment, works by blocking them, which slows or halts the progressive worsening of the condition. Professor McMurray said LCZ696 has a similar impact but the twice-a-day tablet has additional benefits. ‘What this new drug does is simultaneously inhibit the bad hormones – like enalapril – but in addition boosts the production of beneficial hormones,’ he told a meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Barcelona. ‘Several of these stimulate the kidneys to produce more urine – to excrete sodium and water – and act to relax blood vessels. All of these actions unload the failing heart. By having this dual effect LCZ696 had extra beneficial actions compared with enalapril and in this way improved patient outcomes.’ In the trial 8,400 patients with heart failure were given either 200mg of LCZ696 twice daily or 10mg of enalapril twice daily – in addition to recommended therapy – in a bid to compare mortality and hospitalisation rates. Early results published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that 914 (21.8 per cent) of patients in the LCZ696 group died of cardiovascular causes, compared with 1,117 (26.5 per cent) in the enalapril group. A further 711 (17 per cent) of patients receiving LCZ696 and 835 (19.8 per cent) of those receiving enalapril died of other causes. This represented a 20 per cent reduction in death from cardiovascular causes and a 16 per cent reduction in death from any cause for those in the LCZ696 group. Improvement? Sicentists claim it will prevent more deaths than the current heart treatment Enalapril does. The new compound also reduced hospitalisation for heart failure by a fifth, experts said. The ‘emphatic’ results prompted researchers to bring the trial to an early close after 27 months. Another study leader, Professor Milton Packer of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, described the findings as ‘highly statistically significant and clinically important’. The drug’s manufacturer, Novartis, plans to apply for a licence early next year, meaning LCZ696 could be available in 2015. Professor McMurray said: ‘Compared with our current gold-standard bedrock treatment enalapril, LCZ696 made patients live longer, stay out of hospital and feel better, fulfilling all our goals of treatment. ‘This is a remarkable finding.’ Nick Hartshorne-Evans, CEO of the heart failure charity The Pumping Marvellous Foundation, said: ‘Heart failure is a major and growing public health problem in the UK. Almost one million people in the UK live with the syndrome but awareness of it is low. We welcome the results of large-scale clinical trials, especially those that might advance the medical treatment of such an under-invested area.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"A new heart drug called LCZ696 has been tested and shows really good results for treating people who have heart problems. It is working even better than the current best treatment, which is called enalapril. This new drug can help save lots of lives and keep people out of the hospital. It is really useful because heart problems affect many people and can cause tiredness, trouble breathing, and other issues. The new drug could be available soon and may help make people with heart problems feel much better."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 3: Loop through the strings and update matrix - Loop through the strings A and B with nested loops using indices i and j. - For each character at position i in A and j in B, compare A[i] and B[j]. - If A[i] == B[j], update the corresponding cell in the matrix with the value of the previously found common substring length plus 1: - dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 - Otherwise, set the value in the matrix to 0, as the common substring has ended: - dp[i][j] = 0 Step 4: Find the length of the longest common substring - Initialize a variable maxLength to store the length of the longest common substring found during the loop (initially set to 0). - During the matrix update process in step 3, when updating dp[i][j], also check if the updated value is greater than maxLength. If so, update maxLength with the new value and store the indices i and j. Step 5: Extract the longest common substring - Using the maxLength and the indices i and j found in step 4, extract the longest common substring from A by slicing it from index (i - maxLength + 1) to index i+1. Step 6: Return the longest common substring - In this case, the longest common substring is \\"FIoqvf\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What kind of soldiers were killed in Uganda, Libyan or Tanzanian?\\" Context: \\"In 1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of \\"State Sponsors of Terrorism\\", while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Libyan soldiers were killed in Uganda."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Options: - city - court house - chapel - town - office building The answer is \\"office building\\" because Answer:","completion":"We might need to visit a registry office before entering an \\"office building\\" because: Step 1: Analyzing the options - City and town refer to geographical areas or municipalities, which do not necessarily require visits to the registry office for entry. - A courthouse generally involves legal proceedings or filings, but usually, one doesn't need to visit a registry office before entering. - A chapel is a place of worship, and it typically does not require visiting a registry office before entry. Step 2: Focusing on \\"office building\\" - An office building may require a visit to a registry office before entry, as it could involve a workplace environment or a specific business within the building. Step 3: Considering scenarios where registry office visit is needed - If the office building houses a government or administrative agency, one might need to register or obtain a temporary pass by visiting a registry office. - If there is a business that maintains strict access control, visiting their registry office could be necessary for gaining entry to the office building or the specific restricted area.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did Bin Laden tell his Islamic Army he could no longer protect them and that they needed to leave the country?\\" is \\"Because Libya changed its strategy\\"?","completion":"Imagine you are playing with your friends in a playground, and a big kid named Omar lets you play there. One day, some people tell Omar that he should stop letting you play there because you sometimes cause trouble and they don't like it. Omar starts listening to these people and decides that he doesn't want to get in trouble, so he tells you that you can't play in the playground anymore. Similarly, the big kid Omar is like the Sudanese government, and you are like Bin Laden. The Sudanese government was allowing Bin Laden and his friends to stay in their country, but other countries, like Libya, started telling Sudan to stop helping them. So, the Sudanese government decided to listen and told Bin Laden that he couldn't protect his friends anymore, and they had to leave the country. So, the answer is not really because Libya changed its strategy, but because the Sudanese government decided to listen to Libya and other countries and stopped helping Bin Laden."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases. In fact, self-represented litigants - formally called \\"pro se\\" in Latin, or \\"for oneself\\" - in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept, legal experts say. After reading the above, is \\"The presence of the self-help center\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What does Court Administrator Bob Zastany think is going to be extremely helpful?\\"? Available choices: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","completion":"[B]. yes; In the text, Court Administrator Bob Zastany is quoted saying \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" and he is referring to the self-help center. The center is designed to assist people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. So yes, Bob Zastany does think the self-help center is going to be extremely helpful. The other option [A] is incorrect because he did not say that the self-help center will not be helpful, he said the opposite.

The given equation is: -222*j + 8901 + 16276 - 4071 = -3980 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constant terms. The constant terms are 8901, 16276, and -4071. 8901 + 16276 - 4071 = 12177 Now, the simplified equation becomes: -222*j + 12177 = -3980 Next, let's isolate the term with the variable (j) by moving the constant term to the other side. To do this, we'll subtract 12177 from both sides of the equation: -222*j + 12177 - 12177 = -3980 - 12177 This simplifies to: -222*j = -16157 Now, to solve for j, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -222: -222*j / -222 = -16157 / -222 This simplifies to: j = 72.75 So, the solution to the math problem -222*j + 8901 + 16276 - 4071 = -3980 is j = 72.75."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

An osteon is a cylindrical structure that consists of concentric layers of lamellae (concentric rings of bone matrix) surrounding a central Haversian canal. The Haversian canal contains small blood vessels and nerves that provide nutrients and signals to the bone cells. Osteocytes, the mature bone cells, are located in small cavities called lacunae within the lamellae. They are interconnected by tiny canals called canaliculi, which allow for the exchange of nutrients and waste between osteocytes and the Haversian canal.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Hoping to avoid the labor strife that plagued U.S. West Coast seaports over the last eight months, managers of East and Gulf coast ports have started talks aimed at a new contract with organized port workers more than three years before the current agreement expires. The United States Maritime Alliance Ltd., known as USMX, which represents the employers of roughly 15,000 East and Gulf Coast port workers, has opened up the discussions with the International Longshoremen’s Association, the largest union representing East and Gulf coast dockworkers, according to people briefed on the talks. Jim McNamara, an ILA spokesman, confirmed that the union has had “exploratory talks” with management. In past years, USMX and ILA have reached a master agreement that is supplemented by individual agreements between union locals and employers at separate ports. The contract agreed to in 2013 expires Sept. 30, 2018. The talks are in preliminary stages, Mr. McNamara said, and an agenda is unlikely to be set until after the ILA’s annual conference, to be held in July in Puerto Rico. But the USMX approached the union several months ago and ILA President Harold J. Daggett and other union leaders discussed resuming talks about a contract renewal in an all-day meeting May 20 with USMX Chairman and Chief Executive David Adam. Mr. Adam didn't return calls seeking comment. “Our current contract does bring stability even if nothing happens until 2018,” Mr. McNamara said. He said issues in the negotiations are likely to include compensation for longshoremen who have lost work to increasing port automation, maintenance of the ports’ chassis—the undercarriages that hook up to trucks and carry shipping containers—health care benefits and the union’s jurisdiction in ports like Charleston, S.C. and Savannah, Ga., where many crane operators and other dockworkers are nonunion state workers. “We fight hard for our jurisdiction,” Mr. McNamara said. Industry groups representing retailers and manufacturers that buy shipping services have been pushing the East Coast ports to strike a deal with the unions long before the current contract expires to avoid the costly delays and work stoppages that plagued West Coast ports before a contract settlement was reached in February. A federal mediator was brought in during acrimonious negotiations for the most recent East Coast port labor contract in 2012, and the parties extended their contract for four months to accommodate negotiations for a new deal, which was struck in 2013. The 2014-2015 negotiations on the West Coast were even more contentious. The talks between the ILA’s west-coast counterpart, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping lines and port terminal companies, began last May and went past the July expiration of the previous agreement and through the busy holiday season. By the time the groups reached a tentative settlement in February, a standoff marked by cargo handling slowdowns by the unionized workers and temporary terminal shutdowns by the employers had left long lines of ships waiting at sea off the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. Those ports together handle between 30% and 40% of all U.S. ocean container cargo imports, and some shippers redirected many cargo loads to Mexico, Canada, and through the Panama Canal to the East Coast. First-quarter gross domestic product shrank at a 0.7% seasonally-adjusted rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported last week, in part because exports fell by 7.6% in the quarter. Many economists have pointed to the ports slowdown, in addition to the strength of the U.S. dollar, as a key reason for the export weakness. Jonathan Gold, a lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, a trade group that represents many of the country’s largest shippers, said many retailers shifted cargo away from West Coast ports in response to the labor strife, “The ILA and USMX want to maintain that. The only way they can maintain that is by putting shippers at ease that there’s going to be a contract in place,” Mr. Gold said. “It’s better to get it done earlier than to wait. If you can say, ‘We have a long-term contract in place,’ those cargo volumes that you’ve gained might not shift back to the West Coast so quickly. Shippers will pay more for predictability.” In early April, for example, Lowe’s Cos. paid for dockworkers to come in on a Saturday at the Port Newark Container Terminal to unload some 300 shipping containers the big-box retailer had diverted to the East Coast, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lowe’s representatives didn't immediately respond to calls seeking comment. The labor strife was particularly troubling to retailers and manufacturers that depend on trade because the companies were hoping to take advantage last year of a growing economy. In 2014, the number of 20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, handled by U.S. ports, a common measure of shipping container volume, reached a record 46.3 million, topping 45 million for the first time since 2007, according to the American Association of Port Authorities. “We don’t know where we’re going to be in a few years, but there are a lot of issues hanging over the port industry. said Walter Kemmsies, chief economist at Moffatt & Nichol, a maritime engineering consultancy. “Ships are getting a lot larger. There’s a push towards automation and higher productivity levels…Starting now and trying to work out an agenda when no one has a gun to their head seems like a smart thing to do,” Mr. Kemmsies said.

It simply provides information about how the stamps are created and the artwork on them. A detailed and long answer to the question could be: Approximately 98% of all the funds generated by the stamp sales go directly towards the conservation and preservation of wetlands and wildlife habitats. This is accomplished by using the funds to purchase easements or leases of these crucial spaces, as well as supporting restoration and enhancement projects to maintain their health and ecological value. The money raised from the stamp sales plays a vital role in maintaining wetlands specifically in the United States – these habitats are both environmentally and economically important, as they support diverse ecosystems, offer recreational opportunities, and provide essential services such as flood control and water purification. The Federal Duck Stamp Program, established in 1934, is responsible for the creation and sale of these conservation-themed stamps. The US Postal Service is tasked with producing the stamps, which feature various species of waterfowl, such as ducks, geese, and swans, in striking, detailed wildlife artwork. Each year, an annual contest is held by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to select the winning design – the chosen artwork is then featured on the stamps that year. The stamps are not only sought after by hunters as a mandatory purchase for waterfowl hunting licenses, but are also coveted by collectors, artists, and conservationists across the nation. In addition to the support provided by the Federal Duck Stamp Program, partnerships with state governments, non-profit organizations, and private landowners further amplify the power of these funds. The contributions made by these stakeholders increase the overall impact of the program, leading to more extensive conservation efforts across the country. Through the stamp sales and subsequent investment in wetlands and wildlife habitats, more than 6 million acres of lands have been protected or restored over the past eight decades, ensuring the availability of these invaluable habitats for future generations to appreciate and enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How much did oil and gas exploration and production make up Houston's gross product?

Select from: (1). yes. (2). no.","completion":"(2). No. While the provided answer contains useful information, it can be further improved and expanded to give a more detailed and comprehensive answer. Here is a more detailed response to the question: Houston, being the energy capital of the world, has a significant share of oil and gas exploration and production in its gross area product (GAP). In 2010, the mining sector, which predominantly includes oil and gas exploration and production in Houston, made up 26.3% of the city's GAP. This considerable share was due to several factors, including elevated energy prices and a reduced global surplus of oil production capacity. During this period, the oil and gas sector saw strong growth, driven by increasing demand for energy, advances in drilling technologies, and high oil prices. These factors contributed to exploration and production companies investing more heavily in Houston to boost their production capabilities. In addition to the notable contribution from the mining sector, other industries, such as engineering services, health services, and manufacturing, played significant roles in Houston's GAP. Engineering services were closely related to Houston's thriving energy sector, as they offered technical expertise to support the oil and gas exploration and production activities in the area. The health services industry also experienced growth, driven by Houston's growing population and the need for medical services. Manufacturing experienced moderate growth due to the renaissance of the American manufacturing industry during the 2010s. To summarize, the oil and gas exploration and production sector made up a significant 26.3% of Houston's GAP in 2010. This was primarily due to high global energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, which resulted in increased investment and activity in the sector. Other industries, such as engineering services, health services, and manufacturing, also contributed to Houston's GAP during this period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: [tweet https://twitter.com/cgreensit/statuses/342451643381587970 ] The NSA has been collecting the telephone records of Verizon customers, regardless of any suspected wrongdoing, after obtaining a court order in April. The FISA Court gave the FBI a court order to monitor all national and international calls on an “ongoing, daily basis” for three months. Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill and Spencer Ackerman report: The order directs Verizon to “continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this order”. It specifies that the records to be produced include “session identifying information”, such as “originating and terminating number”, the duration of each call, telephone calling card numbers, trunk identifiers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, and “comprehensive communication routing information”. The court order appears to explain the numerous cryptic public warnings by two US senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, about the scope of the Obama administration’s surveillance activities. For roughly two years, the two Democrats have been stridently advising the public that the US government is relying on “secret legal interpretations” to claim surveillance powers so broad that the American public would be “stunned” to learn of the kind of domestic spying being conducted. … It is not known whether Verizon is the only cell-phone provider to be targeted with such an order, although previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks. It is also unclear from the leaked document whether the three-month order was a one-off, or the latest in a series of similar orders. Timothy B. Lee adds: “This confirms what we had long suspected,” says Cindy Cohn, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a civil liberties organization that has long accused the government of operating a secret dragnet surveillance program. “We’ve been suing over this since 2006.” The order is based on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows law enforcement to obtain a wide variety of “business records,” including calling records. EFF has long criticized Section 215, which sets a threshold for obtaining records much lower than the “probable cause” standard required to get a search warrant. But Cohn argues that the kind of dragnet surveillance suggested by the Verizon order exceeds even the authority granted by the Patriot Act. “Section 215 is written as if they’re going after individual people based on individual investigations,” she says. In contrast, the order leaked to the Guardian affects “millions and millions of innocent people. There’s no way all of our calling records are relevant to a terrorism investigation.” Marc Ambinder weighs in: My own understanding is that the NSA routinely collects millions of domestic-to-domestic phone records. It does not do anything with them unless there is a need to search through them for lawful purposes. That is, an analyst at the NSA cannot legally simply perform random searches through the stored data. He or she needs to have a reason, usually some intelligence tip. That would allow him or her to segregate the part of the data that’s necessary to analyze, and proceed from there. In a way, it makes sense for the NSA to collect all telephone records because it can’t know in advance what sections or slices it might need in the future. It does not follow that simply because the NSA collects data that it is legal for the NSA to use the data for foreign intelligence or counter-terrorism analysis. Unfortunately, we don’t know precisely what the NSA can do because its rules are highly classified. This disclosure will hopefully force the government to clarify the rules it uses to actually analyze the data it collects. Amen. But like Ambers, I’m neither shocked nor that outraged. Meta-data is not the content of our phone records. Gregory Ferenstein’s view: The revelation dovetails similar exposes on massive government spying projects, including one project to combine federal datasets and look for patterns on anything which could be related to terrorism. Late last year, I wrote about a few actual harms that citizens should be worried about from these types of big-data spying programs. Blackmailing citizens critical of the government seemed like a distant hypothetical, until we learned that the IRS was auditing Tea Party groups and journalists were being wiretapped. Nefarious actors inside the government like to abuse national security programs for political ends, and that should make us all (even more) suspect of government spying. Ed Morrissey compares Obama’s data-mining to Bush’s: Hypocrisy is an unfortunately ubiquitous condition in politics, but in the case of NSA seizing Verizon’s phone records, it’s particularly widespread. Some of the people expressing outrage for the Obama administration’s efforts at data mining had a different attitude toward it when Bush was in office. Conversely, we’ll see some people defending Obama who considered Bush evil incarnate for the same thing. On that front, this kind of meta-data gathering hasn’t outraged me too much under either administration. This kind of technology is one of the US’ only competitive advantages against Jihadists. Yes, its abuses could be terrible. But so could the consequences of its absence. Maybe the record shows my passionate denunciation of this by Bush. I don’t remember it. If someone finds me in a double-standard here, let me know. Pareene zooms out: ||||| In a statement responding to a report published in the Guardian, the American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday condemned the surrender under the Patriot Act of Verizon customer call logs to the National Security Agency. From the statement: \\"From a civil liberties perspective, the program could hardly be any more alarming. It’s a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents,\\" said Jameel Jaffer, American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director. \\"It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.\\" The program was put in place under the Patriot Act’s Section 215, a controversial provision that authorizes the government to seek secret court orders for the production of \\"any tangible thing\\" relevant to a foreign-intelligence or terrorism investigation. Recipients of Section 215 orders, such as telecommunications companies, are prohibited from disclosing that they gave the government their customers’ records. \\"Now that this unconstitutional surveillance effort has been revealed, the government should end it and disclose its full scope, and Congress should initiate a full investigation,\\" said Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel with the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. \\"This disclosure also highlights the growing gap between the public’s and the government’s understandings of the many sweeping surveillance authorities enacted by Congress. Since 9/11, the government has increasingly classified and concealed not just facts, but the law itself. Such extreme secrecy is inconsistent with our democratic values of open government and accountability.\\" ||||| On Wednesday evening, The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald published a top-secret court order telling Verizon to turn over metadata on millions of business customers — length of calls, phone numbers of both parties, phone-specific identification information, and probably proximate call location, but not the content of calls — to the National Security Agency for three months, from April 25 until July 19, on a daily basis. This is a big deal, Greenwald says, because it \\"shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of U.S. citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk — regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.\\" It appears, Greenwald adds, to be a continuation of the type of data-mining operation secretly authorized by George W. Bush in October 2001, exposed in 2006, to great furor, then made legal by Congress in 2008. We don't know much about how the NSA and other spy agencies work, since their rules are classified. But here's what we know — and think we know — about this potential bombshell of a leak: The NSA can do this — legally? The short answer is: Yes, probably. Section 215 of the 2001 Patriot Act gives the federal government broad authority to demand a number of \\"tangible things,\\" including phone records, from telecommunications firms, as long as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) agrees they are \\"relevant\\" to a national security investigation. Civil liberties and privacy groups have been arguing that the federal government is misinterpreting the law. \\"This confirms what we had long suspected\\" since at least 2006, Cindy Cohn of the Electronic Frontier Foundation tells The Washington Post. \\"Section 215 is written as if they're going after individual people based on individual investigations.... There's no way all of our calling records are relevant to a terrorism investigation.\\" There are a few important caveats here, says Orin Kerr at The Volokh Conspiracy. First, the law \\"says that the 'things' that are collected must be relevant to a national security investigation or threat assessment, but it says nothing about the scope of the things obtained.\\" It would be \\"surprising — and troubling\\" — if the Obama administration is counting whole phone-log databases as a \\"thing,\\" but that's the larger problem: Figuring out what this court order means. \\"While this is potentially a huge story,\\" Kerr says, \\"we don't yet have substantial certainty that the facts are what they have been reported to be.\\" The Guardian has the FISC order but was unable to get anyone to say anything about its context. I don't think we yet know if this 3-page order is what it appears to be, or if there is some other document that may reveal limitations not clear from the 3-page order. Note that the order is titled \\"Secondary Order,\\" which presumably means that there is a primary one that it follows; we don't know what that order said. [Volokh Conspiracy] The other big question mark, says Marc Ambinder at The Week, is why the FBI sought the information. The language [in the law] doesn't rule out such bulk disclosures, but it suggests that the FBI or NSA has to provide the FISC with a good reason for doing so. The court finds that an undefined \\"application\\" from the FBI satisfies that Patriot Act provision... [but] we don't know what application the FISC order responds to. [The Week] Let's be clear, says Joshua Foust at his blog. \\"The NSA, despite the broad nature of its warrant request, did nothing illegal, and the supposed illegality of the FISC procedure has not been demonstrated.\\" Who's affected by the data culling? The court order is aimed at all customers of Verizon Business Network Services. That is \\"one of the nation's largest telecommunications and internet providers for corporations,\\" say Charlie Savage and Edward Wyatt in The New York Times. \\"It is not clear whether similar orders have gone to other parts of Verizon, like its residential or cell phone services, or to other telecommunications carriers.\\" Previous reporting, says Greenwald in The Guardian, \\"has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks.\\" Martin Longman at Booman Tribune speculates that the same is true here: \\"Since this is a leaked court order, I think we can safely assume that all the other phone carriers received a court order, too.\\" Who authorized the phone-log haul? Roger Vinson, a senior federal judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Before this order was made public, Vinson was perhaps most famous for ruling that the ObamaCare individual mandate to buy insurance is unconstitutional — a decision not upheld by the Supreme Court. Funny how things work out: The Tea Party hero who struck down Obamacare also authorized the NSA Verizon warrant. twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/st… — southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) June 6, 2013 Under the Patriot Act, such NSA requests can be approved by either a FISA court judge or \\"a United States Magistrate Judge under chapter 43 of title 28, United States Code, who is publicly designated by the Chief Justice of the United States to have the power to hear applications and grant orders for the production of tangible things under this section on behalf of a judge of that court.\\" Was this a one-off thing? We don't know. But an unidentified \\"expert in this aspect of the law\\" tells The Washington Post that this order appears to be, as the Post puts it, \\"a routine renewal of a similar order first issued by the same court in 2006.\\" The expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, said that the order is reissued routinely every 90 days and that it is not related to any particular investigation by the FBI or any other agency. The expert referred to such orders as \\"rubber stamps\\" sought by the telephone companies to protect themselves after the disclosure in 2005 that widespread warrantless wiretaps could leave them liable for damages. [Washington Post] \\"My own understanding,\\" says Ambinder at The Week, \\"is that the NSA routinely collects millions of domestic-to-domestic phone records.\\" It does not do anything with them unless there is a need to search through them for lawful purposes. That is, an analyst at the NSA cannot legally simply perform random searches through the stored data. He or she needs to have a reason, usually some intelligence tip. That would allow him or her to segregate the part of the data that's necessary to analyze, and proceed from there. In a way, it makes sense for the NSA to collect all telephone records because it can't know in advance what sections or slices it might need in the future. It does not follow that simply because the NSA collects data that it is legal for the NSA to use the data for foreign intelligence or counter-terrorism analysis. [The Week] Why is everyone making such a big deal of this? The idea that the government is spying on its own citizens is kind of creepy. It's important to note that this isn't wiretapping, and \\"this sort of fishing expedition can sometimes be useful to counter-terrorism,\\" says Juan Cole at Informed Comment, \\"but fishing expeditions into private papers and records are a violation of the U.S. constitution,\\" and a recipe for all sorts of potential political abuses. The government should only be allowed to see private information if there is reasonable cause to think something illegal is going on. Going looking into private records to see if patterns emerge that suggest illegality is the action of a totalitarian government, not a democratic one. The USA Patriot Act was a Sovietization of American law and practice and 2001 was year one of the fall of the Republic, when the Fourth Amendment and aspects of the First Amendment were abrogated. [Informed Comment] In fairness, \\"the government can't keep this information forever, nor can they share information on a willy-nilly basis,\\" says Booman Tribune's Longman. \\"And it's too much information for them to look at without running it through sophisticated computers.\\" Those computers aren't looking to see if you're cheating your business partner or fooling around on your husband. But this is concerning nonetheless, because they're using a provision of a law that is supposed to allow the government to snoop on business records in certain defined circumstances to sweep up every electronic communication in the country. [Booman Tribune] Who's to blame? The Obama administration, for one. On Thursday, a senior administration official confirmed that the government is vacuuming up massive amounts of phone logs, arguing that such data collection is \\"a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States.\\" If you're upset about the government possibly knowing who you call and when, you could also blame the FISC judges who sign off on the data sweeps. But if you really want to nail someone, look to your senator or congressman, says Joshua Foust. \\"All of the opprobrium you should feel at the government's ridiculously broad surveillance powers needs to be directed at CONGRESS, which keeps approving them while voting they stay secret.\\" Congress voted to legalize expansive surveillance powers in 2001 (The USA Patriot Act), 2008 (retroactive immunity for warrantless NSA wiretaps in the FISA Amendments Act), and in 2012 (renewing the FISA Amendments Act). Congress declined to force administration transparency/honesty on secret interpretations of the law in 2001 (USA Patriot Act), 2008 (NSA immunity), 2011 (the [Sen. Ron] Wyden amendment to the NDAA, which would have required interpretations not be secret) & 2012 (the similar [Sen. Jeff] Merkley amendment to the NDAA). Those last two actually got voted down, which means Congress voted to enable secret government legal interpretation. [Joshua Foust] What's the fix? Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) — both on the Senate intelligence committee — have been publicly urging the Obama administration to lay out its interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act for at least a year. \\"As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows,\\" they wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. \\"This is a problem, because it is impossible to have an informed public debate about what the law should say when the public doesn't know what its government thinks the law says.\\" Other people, like Juan Cole, want the Patriot Act — or as he calls it, \\"the most un-American and anti-patriotic piece of legislation since the Alien and Sedition Act\\" — repealed, or at least greatly scaled back. This data reaping is \\"astonishing and appalling on many levels,\\" says Andrew Kirell at Mediaite, but it is not surprising in post-9/11 America. This latest example of Obama overreach is sure to rankle the feathers of conservatives.... While many of these same conservatives were rah-rah'ing the expansion of the NSA and United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during the Bush years, it is a pleasant change to see them finally care about FISA. Welcome aboard. Now it's up to the liberals who rightly lauded Obama's anti-FISA stance in 2008 to swallow their pride as well and take a stand against this administration's overreach, despite what they might see as partisan opportunism coming from the right. As the last 13 years have proven, regardless of who is in the White House the security state will continue to expand. And it will take some hypocrisy on both sides to finally end it. [Mediaite] This data-mining could be \\"Orwellian,\\" or it could be narrower than we think, says Ambinder. \\"Unfortunately, we don't know precisely what the NSA can do because its rules are highly classified.\\" At the very least, \\"this disclosure will hopefully force the government to clarify the rules it uses to actually analyze the data it collects.\\" ||||| Robert Scoble / Flickr Mark this news, America. It is yet another wake-up call. \\"The National Security Agency is currently collecting the telephone records of millions of US customers of Verizon, one of America's largest telecoms providers, under a top secret court order issued in April,\\" Glenn Greenwald reports . \\"The order, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian , requires Verizon on an 'ongoing, daily basis' to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the US and between the US and other countries.\\" Just as disturbing is the fact that we don't even know if AT&T and other major telecommunications companies have received similar secret orders.Says the Electronic Frontier Foundation How is this legal? The order was sought by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that regulates domestic surveillance for national security purposes, including \\"tangible things\\" like a business's customer records. The provision was expanded by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which Congress enacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. ...it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks. People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers; and the books, groceries, and medications they purchase to online retailers. Perhaps, as JUSTICE ALITO notes, some people may find the \\"tradeoff\\" of privacy for convenience \\"worthwhile,\\" or come to accept this \\"diminution of privacy\\" as \\"inevitable,\\" and perhaps not. I for one doubt that people would accept without complaint the warrantless disclosure to the Government of a list of every Web site they had visited in the last week, or month, or year. But whatever the societal expectations, they can attain constitutionally protected status only if our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence ceases to treat secrecy as a prerequisite for privacy. I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection. There is, in fact, debate about whether it is legal, but explains the government's theory:How is it tolerated by the American people?That's the most pressing question. The civic negligence required to reach this point is the thing that most disappoints me about my fellow citizens, who ought to throw out every last member of Congress complicit in the metastasizing surveillance state. I am serious. Look up your representative. In a letter or phone call, demand they take a stand against this, on penalty of you voting against them in a primary or general.That's how change happens when the president who promised it turns out to have lied.if the federal government has a similar order for AT&T or any other carrier. Or if they're spying on Americans' emails as well. Why? That isn't the sort of thing President Obama thinks he needs to tell us, and Congress persists in giving him that latitude. Americans, who haven't been objecting to any of this in large numbers, aren't even demanding to know whether or not their government is assemblingHas fear of terrorism done this to us?Apathy?Denial?Whatever the cause, the current behavior of the American electorate does not befit a free people.The Supreme Court, the one branch of government not accountable to the people, hasn't been helpful either, though there is a passage from a Sonia Sotomayor concurrence that merits wider attention A change in jurisprudence is years away from happening, if it ever happens. The surveillance state as now constituted could be reined in quickly if only the American people demanded it. Wake up! Senator Mark Udall says that this is the kind of surveillance Americans will find shocking.Is he right? ||||| [embedtweet id=\\"342443594474463232\\"] Conor Friedersdorf is right, but Republicans have mostly already failed this litmus test. Given the opportunity to limit the powers of the NSA during the Obama administration Republicans in the House and Senate voted to reauthorize the NSA's post-9/11 expanded powers.

Because he is a Democrat criticizing his party from the left, his warnings and complaints have been given only cursory mention in the nonpartisan press, especially compared to the similar, but frequently much more ridiculous criticisms lobbied against the administration by Rand Paul.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country, he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations, but provide a measure of continued economic growth.\\" answer the question \\"What event led Eisenhower to want to improve highways in the US?\\"","completion":"The sentence provided does not directly answer the question \\"What event led Eisenhower to want to improve highways in the US?\\" The sentence does, however, mention Eisenhower's recognition of the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country and his belief that an Interstate Highway System would benefit both military operations and economic growth. To give a detailed and long answer, we need to delve into the historical context and events surrounding Eisenhower's push for the Interstate Highway System. The actual event that led President Eisenhower to want to improve highways in the United States can be traced back to two key experiences in his life. The first experience was his participation in the U.S Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy, and the second was his exposure to the efficient German Autobahn during World War II. 1. 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy: In the summer of 1919, a young Dwight D. Eisenhower, then a Lt. Colonel, took part in the U.S. Army's Transcontinental Motor Convoy. This convoy was an ambitious military exercise to test the viability of transporting troops, vehicles, and equipment across the United States. The journey began in Washington, D.C. and ended in San Francisco, California, covering approximately 3,251 miles. The mission intended to assess the state of American roads, their suitability for military purposes, and the challenges that might arise during a large-scale, cross-country military operation. Throughout the journey, the convoy encountered numerous problems due to the poor condition of American roads at that time. They faced impassable stretches of dirt roads, broken bridges, and treacherous terrain, which caused multiple delays and vehicle breakdowns. This experience made a lasting impression on Eisenhower, highlighting the importance of a well-built and maintained highway system for both military and civilian purposes. 2. The German Autobahn during World War II: Fast-forward to World War II, where Eisenhower served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe. Here, he observed the strategic advantages of the German Autobahn. The Autobahn, a high-quality and extensive network of highways that crisscrossed Germany, allowed for efficient and rapid transportation of troops, vehicles, and supplies. The German's superior infrastructure provided a stark contrast to the inadequate road system Eisenhower had experienced in the United States. These two key experiences provided the impetus for Eisenhower's push to improve highways in the United States. Once he became President in 1953, he made it one of his administration's priorities to address the nation's infrastructure shortcomings. These efforts culminated in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the construction of the United States Interstate Highway System, a 41,000-mile network of highways aimed at improving military mobility and fostering economic growth. The Act allocated substantial funding, laid out the framework for the highway system, and established a program to oversee its implementation. In conclusion, the sentence provided offers a glimpse into Eisenhower's thought process surrounding the creation of the Interstate Highway System, but it does not directly answer the question about the events that led to his interest in improving American highways. The actual answer lies in the combination of his experience with the 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy and his exposure to the German Autobahn during World War II, both of which revealed the critical need for a better highway system in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Deep in the wilderness of northern Kenya, two boys found a pair of crying cheetah cubs . The cubs' mother had been killed by a lion. The cheetahs were only a few weeks old. In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \\"heroes\\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

Question: what is the purpose of vitamin d A:","completion":"The purpose of Vitamin D is multifaceted and highly essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the human body. Some of the primary purposes and functions of Vitamin D are as follows: 1. Regulation of Calcium and Phosphate Homeostasis: One of the main purposes of Vitamin D is to enhance the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the small intestine, ensuring proper mineralization of bones and teeth. It helps to maintain calcium and phosphate levels in the bloodstream at an optimal range, which is crucial for maintaining bone health and preventing conditions such as osteoporosis, rickets in children, and osteomalacia in adults. 2. Bone Health: Vitamin D helps in the maintenance of healthy bones by aiding in the formation, growth, and remodeling of bones. It facilitates calcium absorption and utilization, thus promoting bone density and reducing the risk of fractures. 3. Cell Growth, Differentiation, and Apoptosis: Vitamin D, particularly its active form calcitriol, influences the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (programmed cell death) of various cells in the body. This plays an essential role in the normal growth and development of tissues, and helps in maintaining healthy functioning of various organs. 4. Neuromuscular Function: Vitamin D contributes to the proper functioning of the nervous and muscular systems. It aids in the conduction of nerve impulses and muscle contractions, and helps maintain muscle strength and coordination. 5. Immune System Support: Vitamin D plays a significant role in modulating and regulating the immune system. It enhances the body's ability to fight against infections and reduces inflammation, thus lowering the risk of developing autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 6. Hormonal Balance: Vitamin D contributes to the synthesis and regulation of several hormones in the body, including parathyroid hormone, which is essential for maintaining the balance of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream. 7. Cardiovascular Health: Vitamin D may also play a role in maintaining cardiovascular health. Some studies suggest that adequate Vitamin D levels are associated with reduced risk of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. 8. Cancer Prevention: Research has shown that Vitamin D has potential anticancer properties, playing a role in preventing the growth and spread of cancer by affecting cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, as well as inhibiting angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that support tumor development). 9. Mental Health Support: Emerging studies show possible links between Vitamin D and mental health, including its potential role in preventing and treating depression and other mood disorders. In summary, the purpose of Vitamin D extends beyond its popular association with bone health; it is also involved in various physiological processes such as cell growth, neuromuscular function, immune system regulation, and inflammation control. Maintaining adequate levels of Vitamin D is crucial for optimal health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A: Answer:","completion":"Wind is one method for dispersal of seeds and spores, ensuring a new generation of plants and fungi. This natural mechanism, known as anemochory or wind dispersal, is a crucial process in the life cycle and reproduction of many plants, allowing them to spread beyond their immediate surroundings, increasing genetic diversity, and occupying and adapting to new habitats. There are several characteristics and adaptations that plants and fungi have evolved to take advantage of wind dispersal. Some of these features include: 1. Lightweight seeds or spores: Seeds that are dispersed by the wind are generally small and lightweight, allowing them to be easily carried by air currents. Some examples of this are the seeds of dandelions, which have a delicate, parachute-like structure called a pappus, and those of orchids, which produce very tiny, dust-like seeds. 2. Winged seeds: Some plants have seeds equipped with thin, wing-like structures that enable them to glide on the wind to cover a broader area. Maple and ash trees are examples of plants with these types of seeds, often called samaras. The aerodynamic shape of the wings helps the seeds to travel farther away from the parent plant. 3. Long feathery appendages: Certain plants, such as the fireweed and thistle, produce seeds with feathery appendages called plumes that act like parachutes, increasing their ability to float on the wind, ensuring they are carried away from the parent plant. 4. Pods or capsules: Some plants release seeds from dehiscent fruits, pods, or capsules, which burst open when ripe to disperse the seeds into the wind. An example of this is the poppy plant, which has a capsule that opens and releases numerous tiny seeds that can be carried by the wind. 5. Explosive devices: Some plants have evolved mechanisms allowing them to forcibly expel their seeds into the air, increasing the likelihood of wind dispersal. The touch-me-not plant (Impatiens) has seed pods that burst open when touched, projecting the seeds away from the parent plant, where they can potentially be caught up in the wind. 6. Height advantage: Trees and tall plants can distribute their seeds or spores farther by releasing them from a greater height, providing a better chance of catching the wind. Pine trees, for example, release their lightweight pollen grains high up in the air, ensuring wide dispersal by the wind.

In this statement, the user feels that being tested for drug use at work is an invasion of their privacy. They also mention that alcohol consumption on weekends can lead to a hangover and worsen job performance compared to taking Ecstasy on a Friday night. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis to be evaluated is, \\"Even if I come into work hung over, I think it's an invasion of my privacy to test me--besides, alcohol isn't as dangerous as Ecstasy or something.\\" The hypothesis contains two parts; the first part says that it's an invasion of privacy to test someone for substance use, and the second part compares alcohol with other substances like Ecstasy, stating that alcohol isn't as dangerous. Step 3: Comparing the premise and hypothesis Now we need to compare the premise and the hypothesis to determine if the hypothesis is true based on the given premise. First, the premise and the hypothesis both share the belief that drug testing at work is considered an invasion of privacy. This part of the hypothesis aligns with the premise. Second, while the premise mentions alcohol and Ecstasy, it doesn't provide a clear comparison of their dangers. For example, it's mentioned that alcohol can cause a hangover and worse job performance, whereas taking Ecstasy on a Friday night doesn't necessarily impact job performance on Monday. However, it is important to note that the actual dangers of the substances themselves were not directly compared in the premise. Conclusion: Based on the given premise, the first part of the hypothesis \\"Even if I come into work hung over, I think it's an invasion of my privacy to test me\\" can be considered true. However, the second part of the hypothesis, \\"alcohol isn't as dangerous as Ecstasy or something,\\" cannot be concluded to be true or false due to the lack of direct comparison between the dangers of alcohol and other substances like Ecstasy in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Imagine you have 1036 apples (a lot, right?) and you want to multiply them by some number (let's call it a). After multiplying, you will give away 513 apples. On the other side, you have 1063 apples that you also want to multiply by the same number (a). The question asks you to find the value of that number (a). Here is the math problem: 1036 * a - 513 = 1063 * a First, we want to get all the \\"a\\" terms on one side. So, let's subtract 1036 * a from both sides: -513 = 1063 * a - 1036 * a Now, we can combine the \\"a\\" terms on the right side: -513 = 27 * a Next, to find the value of a, we will divide both sides by 27: -513 / 27 = a Now, let's do the division: a = -19 So the answer is: a = -19. It means that if you multiply both sets of apples (1036 & 1063) by -19, they will have the same difference as taking away 513 apples from the first set."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is the Goddess of Wealth? Movie title: Saraswathi Sabatham Movie plot: Narada (Sivaji Ganesan), a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the fight by visiting Saraswati (Savitri), the Goddess of knowledge, and purposely annoys Her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. Saraswati angrily said that She will prove that Her power, knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi (Devika), the Goddess of wealth, and also annoys Her by saying that education is more abundant and is the best.

It demands immense strength, flexibility, and control of the body, as well as the ability to communicate emotions through movement. One of the core foundations of ballet technique lies in the mastery of the five fundamental positions of the feet, which serve as the basis for all other movements and steps within this captivating dance form. In this article, we will delve into the specifics of each of these five essential ballet positions, taking you through the process of moving from first to fifth position in a step-by-step manner. By understanding the nuances and precise alignments of each position, you will be better equipped to progress in your ballet journey and unlock the full potential of your artistic expression. 1. First Position First position is the starting point for all ballet positions, and it is therefore critical to ensure that your body alignment and placement are correct from the outset. Start by standing with your heels touching and your feet turned out to the sides as far as is comfortable, ideally forming a straight line from heel to heel. Rotate your legs outward from the hips, engaging the muscles in your glutes and inner thighs while elongating your spine and maintaining a neutral pelvis. Hold your head high and slightly lifted as if being pulled upwards by an invisible string, and tuck your chin in slightly. Your arms should be rounded, with your fingertips lightly touching near the level of your navel. This portrays an element of grace and poise while maintaining a strong core and optimal posture. 2. Second Position From first position, smoothly glide your right foot out to the side while maintaining the same turnout and alignment as the left foot. The ideal distance between your heels is approximately the length of one of your feet. As your foot moves into second position, your arms should also adjust accordingly. Raise your arms to the side at a graceful curve, with your elbows slightly bent, and your palms facing forward and slightly downward. Keep your arms lower than your shoulders and make sure your shoulders remain open and relaxed. In second position, adequate weight distribution is essential to prevent excessive strain on your knees and ankles. Keep your weight evenly spread throughout your entire foot, with your knees slightly bent and aligned over your ankles. 3. Third Position To transition into third position, slide your right foot towards your left, placing it in front of the left foot with the heel touching the arch. This position is less commonly used in modern ballet training, as it can be challenging to maintain proper alignment, but it is still featured in certain classical ballet sequences. As you move into third position, your arms will also need to adjust. Bring your right arm up in front of you, with the same rounded shape as in first position, while maintaining your left arm in its second position. Keep your shoulder blades down and your chest open, all the while maintaining a strong core and straight spine. 4. Fourth Position From third position, slide your right foot out to the side again, but this time, place it about six inches in front of the left foot, maintaining the same turned out alignment. Your weight should be distributed equally across both feet, with your knees slightly bent and tracking over the toes. In fourth position, your arms will change once more. Raise your left arm above your head with a rounded curve, so that it frames your face. Keep your right arm in its previous position from third, leaving a slight space between your fingertips and your body for an air of elegance. 5. Fifth Position Lastly, to achieve the final and most advanced position, fifth, slide your right foot back towards your left, with the heel snugly placed against the joint of the left big toe, and vice versa for the other foot. The feet should be aligned in a parallel manner, with the knees close together, and your legs fully rotated outwards from the hip joints. As you enter fifth position, your arms will follow suit. Lower your left arm to meet your right in front of your body, still maintaining those curved lines, with your fingertips almost touching. This position resembles first position, but with heightened precision and control. Conclusion By seamlessly transitioning from first to fifth position, you will have explored the fundamental underlying positions within ballet. Each of these positions is essential for developing proper technique, strength, and alignment, as well as instilling a sense of elegance and grace in your movement. As you continue to practice and refine these positions, your body will become more attuned to the delicate nuances of ballet, providing you with a strong foundation from which to explore a myriad of other ballet steps and choreography. Remember, as with any artistic discipline, the key to mastery is consistent practice, patience, and dedication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

U.S. Sets Duties on Korean Steel for Oil Drilling The Obama administration imposed duties on steel pipe from South Korea and eight other nations in a victory for U.S. Steel Corp. (X) and the United Steelworkers union, which said they were hurt by unfair competition from overseas. U.S. Steel rose 3.2 percent in New York trading. The U.S. Commerce Department set duties from 9.89 percent to 15.75 percent on Korean pipe, which is used in oil drilling, according to a fact sheet released today by the agency. Last year, pipe worth 818 million was exported to the U.S. from South Korea. Duties ranging from 2.05 percent to 118.32 percent also were imposed on pipe from the other nations, which sent 722 million worth of pipe to the U.S. last year. “We applaud their decision to prevent further gamesmanship of our laws and to secure our nation’s economy,” U.S. Steel Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi said today in a statement. The Commerce Department determined the steel pipe had been sold in the U.S. below cost, or dumped, in violation of international trade rules, after the steel industry filed a complaint. The duties must be paid on the imports immediately, though will be refunded if the U.S. International Trade Commission determines that American producers weren’t harmed by the imports, a ruling scheduled in the coming months. “This practice has already caused serious harm to our domestic steel industry,” Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said today in a statement. “Plants are being idled, workers are losing jobs and communities are suffering.” Today’s finding overturns a Commerce Department decision in February not to set anti-dumping duties on the Korean imports. U.S. Steel, the nation’s largest metal producer, and the union said that determination was miscalculated, and they lobbied for penalty duties. U.S. Steel rose 86 cents to 27.64 at 4:15 p.m. New York time, and touched 28,30, a 5.7 percent increase, after the decision was disclosed. The shares are down 6.3 percent this year. Officials from the South Korean embassy in Washington declined to comment publicly. “Today’s ruling is an important step toward ensuring a level playing field for our workers and businesses,” Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, said in a joint statement with Rob Portman, his Republican colleague. U.S. Steel has a major manufacturing facility for the goods in Lorain, Ohio, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Cleveland. Pipe exported by Hyundai Hysco Co. (010520) will be subject to 15.75 percent duty, and products from Nexteel Co. will face a 9.89 percent duty. Other Korean manufacturers will pay a duty of 12.82 percent. “I’m not sure that they’re big enough to have a big difference,” Michelle Applebaum, an independent steel consultant and adjunct professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois, said in a telephone interview. “Nine to 15 percent, it will give some relief, but considering how much overcapacity there is in the global pipe market it’s a better-than-nothing kind of solution.” The other nations shipping pipe subject to duties are India, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam. The U.S. set duties as high as 118.32 percent on products from WSP in Thailand, and as low as 2.05 percent on GVN Fuels Ltd. of India. The Commerce Department also set anti-subsidy duties as high as 19.11 percent on steel goods from India and as high as 15.89 percent on the products from Turkey. The U.S. said it will require the foreign producers to pay cash deposits on the imports. The International Trade Commission is scheduled to issue its decision on Korea and Taiwan by the end of September and the remaining countries in late August. The dispute united industry and union leaders who pressed their case with lawmakers, President Barack Obama’s administration and the media in recent months. They say they’ve been especially concerned about a surge in imports of the Korean-made goods, which increased about 45 percent in volume and 19 percent in value from 2011 to 2013, according to Commerce Department data. U.S. Steel on June 2 said it was closing two plants, with a total of 260 workers, in Pennsylvania and Texas because of foreign competition. U.S. Steel is the biggest domestic producer of pipes and tubes sold to oil and gas companies, and the sales of the products represented 48 percent of its 2013 operating income.

Do those questions have the same meaning? (A). no. (B). yes.","completion":"(A) No, the two questions do not have exactly the same meaning, but they are closely related. Let's evaluate them and discuss the differences. 1. \\"How long would humans survive if the sun burned out?\\" This question is asking specifically about the hypothetical scenario in which the sun ceases to exist or loses its energy entirely. To understand the consequences of such a scenario, we need to explore the sun's critical role in supporting life on Earth. The sun is the ultimate source of energy for the Earth and drives most processes on our planet, including the climate, ocean currents, photosynthesis, and many more, which in turn support the existence of the diversity of life we see today. If the sun were to burn out suddenly, the immediate effects would be dramatic. Earth would lose its main source of light, which would result in continuous darkness. Daytime temperatures would drop rapidly, eventually plummeting to the freezing point and below within a matter of weeks or months. The surface temperature would decrease drastically, reaching around -100 degrees Fahrenheit (-73 degrees Celsius) within a year. The cold would ultimately become too severe for most humans to bear. Oceans and other bodies of water would gradually freeze, starting from the surface. This would negatively affect the marine ecosystems and eventually disrupt the entire food chain, making it very difficult, if not impossible, for life to thrive. Ultimately, a significant portion of Earth's plants and animals would die due to the lack of light and extreme cold. The imbalance of life on Earth would result in a significantly reduced food supply, leaving humans with little to no sustenance. Without sunlight, photosynthesis – the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth – would cease to occur. Since plants form the basis of most food chains, this would be disastrous for the majority of life forms. This would lead to a rapid decline in oxygen levels, reducing the breathable air supply required for human survival. Without enough oxygen, humans might last only a few minutes or hours. To sum up, in the event that the sun burns out, humans would have a difficult time surviving without some form of artificial light, heat, food, and oxygen sources. The exact duration of human survival might vary depending on the individual and the availability of resources, but it would likely be a matter of weeks or months, rather than years, before the majority of the human population perished. 2. \\"Could humans survive without the sun?\\" This question is broader, asking about the potential for human survival in any scenario where the sun is not present or providing its life-sustaining energy. While the initial answer is quite negative, as described in the first question, there might be some remote possibilities of human survival without the sun. For example, humans could potentially develop advanced technologies such as artificial environments or underground habitats for maintaining warmth, light, oxygen, and food production. Though highly challenging, it is worth considering what technological advances might enable humans to adapt and survive in a world devoid of the sun's energy. In addition to technological solutions, some microorganisms deep within the Earth's crust could be sources of energy and sustenance. These extremophiles rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis to survive, using chemicals from their environment to generate energy. This process is independent of the sun's radiation, suggesting that life, albeit limited and specialized, could potentially persist without the sun. To conclude, while the two questions are related, they do not carry the exact same meaning. The first question focuses on a specific scenario – the sun burning out and its immediate consequences, whereas the second question is broader, asking about general human survival without the sun. While the chances of human survival without the sun would be meager, the exploration of advanced technologies and alternative energy sources offers a glimpse of potential solutions."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

One of my fellow volunteers, a girl from Tanzania, seemed a little unhappy, so I asked what the problem was. She told me she had a friend back home who had financial difficulties and maybe it was impossible for her to complete her university courses. So this friend of mine had sent all her money to Tanzania to support her friend! This meant that she didn't have much food to eat and no money to go anywhere outside the village. I was so touched and I felt I had to do something. So, during my next trip to one of the nearby towns I walked into a shop. I didn't have much money left myself but I thought I'd buy her an extra box of chocolate we both liked and some rice. I started talking to the woman(also a volunteer)working in the shop and eventually told her about my friend. The woman looked at me, amazed. \\"Does she eat pasta?\\" she asked. \\"Yes,\\" I replied. She immediately started loading a bag with pasta, cookies, and other things until the bag was full. \\"Give her this for me. It's my treat!'' I couldn't believe it but accepted with happiness. As I left the shop to go home with my unexpected bag of food, I asked the woman her name. \\"Just Gloria,\\" she said. Imagine my friend's face when I arranged the gifts on my kitchen table and fetched her from her room to see! I had never seen her so happy!

As he collapses in the street, he drops his wallet. It is picked up by a bystander, emptied of its cash, and shoved into a wastebasket. Without the wallet, there is no way to immediately identify the body as Bullard. George Caswell, a member of the Tredway board of directors and one of the investment bankers with whom Bullard had just met, sees what he believes is Bullard's body in the street below their offices and decides to profit from the information. He engages a broker to make a short sale of as much Tredway stock as he can before the end of trading that Friday afternoon. Caswell plans to make an easy profit and cover the sale by buying Tredway stock at \\"a 10-point discount\\" on Monday, when news of Bullard's death will presumably push the stock price down. Caswell begins to doubt that it was Bullard who died, but when he reads in a newspaper that the man had the initials \\"A.B.\\" on his clothes and cufflinks, he calls the police to tip them off to the identity of the deceased. Bullard had never named his successor. Over the next 28 hours, Tredway's executives vie for the position of president. Once news of his death reaches Tredway, company controller Loren Shaw takes the initiative in arranging Bullard's funeral and coordinating the company's public reaction. In so doing, he undercuts treasurer Frederick Alderson, one of Bullard's closest friends. Shaw also shrewdly releases the upcoming quarterly report so that the good news of big profits can counter the news and perhaps even raise the stock price when the market opens.

Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name? , can you please find it? The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name, is Shostakovich.

But we should only have a little bit of it, too much isn't good for us. In this case, the data says that there are 4.8 grams of fat in the Barny Cakes. A gram is just a tiny way to measure how much of something there is. So, this means that if you eat a Barny Cake, you're having a little bit of fat with your treat, which is 4.8 tiny units of fat. This can give you an idea of how much fat you're eating, and then you can make sure you're not having too much throughout the day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

The duo formed in 1968 under the name Halfnelson. Known for their quirky approach to songwriting, Sparks' music is often accompanied by intelligent, sophisticated, and acerbic lyrics, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's distinctive falsetto voice and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style. Relocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two Whistle Test performance, they placed an ad in music weekly Melody Maker (\\"Wanted bass player for Sparks. Must be beard free and exciting\\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \\"Dinky\\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", despite Elton John betting producer Muff Winwood that the song would not break into the charts. Sparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", \\"Amateur Hour\\" and \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache. Gordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the Kimono and Propaganda albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Flo & Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977. The follow-up albums, Propaganda and Indiscreet, the latter produced by Tony Visconti, were similarly successful and produced the hit singles \\"Looks, Looks, Looks\\", \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" and \\"Something for the Girl with Everything\\".

And I was wondering Why did Ash do this?","completion":"Ash's choice of taking the long way home might have been influenced by several factors, either individually or in combination. Here are some key reasons that could have led Ash to walk the longer route: 1. Scenic and Relaxing Walk: Ash might have wanted to enjoy a more scenic and picturesque route on the way home. The longer path could offer beautiful views or pass through parks, forests, or other natural environments that provide a calming and serene atmosphere, which can be a great way to unwind after a long day at school. 2. Exercise and Health Benefits: Walking a longer distance can be an effective way to get more exercise and keep up with physical fitness. Ash might have been conscious of the importance of staying active or may have set a personal goal to walk a specific distance or spend more time walking each day. 3. Socialization: Perhaps Ash preferred the longer route because it allowed for more interaction with friends, classmates, or acquaintances. Walking together can be a great way to chat, share experiences, and bond with others on the way home from school. 4. Mental Detox and Reflection: A longer walk can offer Ash the time and space to process thoughts, emotions, and experiences from the day at school. This extra time might be precious for introspection, creative thinking, or problem-solving, helping Ash feel refreshed and more focused upon returning home. 5. Safety Concerns: The longer route home could be considered safer for various reasons. The path might be more populated, well-lit, or less isolated than the shorter alternatives. Additionally, by choosing a different or unexpected route, Ash might be minimizing the risk of encountering any potential threats or unsavory characters. 6. Avoiding Unpleasant Situations or Stimuli: The longer route might bypass construction sites, pollution, noisy streets, or areas where Ash might encounter someone or something uncomfortable or distressing. Taking the long way home might be a way to ensure a more pleasant and peaceful experience. 7. Exploration and Adventure: Ash might have a sense of adventure or curiosity, wishing to explore new paths or neighborhoods as a way to make the daily walk home a more exciting and new experience. This feeling of wanderlust and exploration can make the longer route a more appealing option. As we cannot directly ask Ash, we can only speculate on the reasons for choosing the long way home. It is possible that one or more of these reasons may apply in this particular situation. Ultimately, Ash might have found that walking the long way home provided an overall more enjoyable, beneficial, and meaningful experience than taking the shorter route."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The college student forgotten in a holding cell for five days without food or water, took a 4.1 million settlement from the Justice Department his lawyer announced Tuesday. 24-year-old University of California, San Diego student Daniel Chong was arrested on April 21, 2012 as part of a major drug bust. He was taken to county jail and subsequently forgotten in a cell for five days - starving and hallucinating. Scroll down for video. Payout: The college student who was taken to county jail and subsequently forgotten for five days, settled with the Department of Justice Tuesday for 4million. Torture: Mr Chong endured five days forgotten in the cell, drinking his own urine and hallucinating. “It was an accident,” Mr Chong said in a news conference on Tuesday attended by KPBS, “a really bad, horrible accident.” Mr Chong's attorney Eugene Iredale said that the Justice Department is still trying to figure out how Mr Chong slipped from their notice, but the inspector general still has no answers. The DEA did not have a system in place at the time on how to treat detainees, but has since installed camera in each of the cells and holds daily inspections. “What happened to Daniel should never happen to any human being on the face of the planet,' Mr Ireland said in the press conference. 'The government has recognized the profound suffering that Daniel underwent,' he said. Mr Iredale said that no one has been disciplined for the drug bust, and that no criminal charges will be filed. The student originally planned to sue for 20million. Mr Chong said he is in good health back UC San Diego studying engineering. The engineering student was swept up as one of nine suspects in an April 21 drug raid that netted 18,000 ecstasy pills, other drugs and weapons. Left alone: Mr Chong was arrested on April 21 as part of a drug bust, but was told he was going to be released. Seven suspects were taken to county. jail, and another was released, but Mr Chong was somehow left behind, said Amy Roderick, a. spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration. 'Each suspect was interviewed in separate interview rooms, and frequently moved around between rooms and cells,' Ms Roderick said. 'The individual in question was accidentally left in one of the cells.' Mr Chong said federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents told him he would be let go. One agent even promised to drive him home from the DEA field office in Kearny Mesa, he said. Instead, he was returned to a holding cell to await release. Mr Chong said he could hear the muffled voices of agents outside his five-by-10-foot windowless cell and the door of the next cell being opened and closed. Righting the wrong: Mr Chong originally sued for 20million. He kicked and screamed as loud as he could, but apparently, his cries for help went unheard. 'I had to recycle my own urine,' he said. 'I had to do what I had to do to survive.' During the ordeal, he lost 15 pounds, according to NBC. He said at one point, the lights shut. off and he was left in the dark inside the five-by-10-foot windowless. cell. He began to hallucinate. 'I was completely insane,' he said. 'It’s impossible to describe hallucinations like these.' Mr Chong also said that he bit into his glasses to break them and tried. to use a shard to scratch 'Sorry Mom' into his arm, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. When he was found on April 25, he was taken to a hospital and treated for cramps, dehydration and a perforated lung - the result of ingesting the broken glass. 'When they opened the door, one of them said \`Here's the water you've been asking for,' Mr Chong said. 'But I was pretty out of it at the time.' Mr Chong also ingested a white powder DEA agents said was left in the cell accidentally and later identified as methamphetamine. It took him nearly five days at Sharp hospital to recover, he said.","completion":"1.

Summarize the following: Travel to a geographical region where salamanders generally reside. One-third of all salamander species can be found in North America, specifically in the Appalachian Mountains region. Salamanders also reside throughout Central America, South America, Asia, and Europe. There are over 700 different species of salamanders in the world, and they all come in a variety of sizes and colors. Salamanders have long, smooth bodies and four limbs, and they can be a small as 2 inches long, while others can grow to 4 feet long! Some species of salamanders are brightly colored, which can indicate that they are poisonous. The hellbender is a type of large salamander found in North America, which can grow up to 2.5 feet in length! Northern red salamanders are typically found in Maryland and live in natural springs. They are a bright, beautiful red with black flecks. Some salamanders, such as the axolotl or the Mexican salamander, are pale pink or white. These types of salamanders live underground and are rarely exposed to sunlight. Most salamanders live underground but will move out of dormancy in the spring to breed in vernal pools, which are shallow depressions in the ground that contain water during this time of year. This is the best time of year to search for these critters in the wild. Locations near wetlands, streams, rivers, ponds, marshes, and swamps are ideal locations for salamanders to make their home. Most salamanders have a long larval stage and spend most of their early life in the water, much like frogs do. These moist environments are ideal for catching a glimpse of these animals in the wild. Edge environments, or eco tones, describe areas where two different habitats meet. Salamanders can often be found in these environments, so be sure to look near the shorelines of streams or near shrubs and bushes near shallow water. Salamanders may also be found around seeps, which are areas where ground water slowly moves toward the surface. Keep an eye out for springs, seeps, and other boggy areas where these amphibians often make their home. Salamanders are carnivorous and eat a variety of insects and worms. In the wild, a salamander will eat crickets, worms, larvae, spiders, slugs—pretty much anything that it can easily swallow! If you know where to find their favorite meals, you may have a greater chance of spotting a salamander scurrying about. Many of the insects in the salamander's diet can be found under logs, rocks, and branches, so you may spot a salamander lurking around these areas. Larger salamanders will often eat frogs and smaller salamanders, while aquatic salamanders will eat small fish, crayfish, and other small aquatic creatures. If you come across a pool of still moving water with lots of rocks and tree roots, take a closer look! Crayfish are often found there, so your chances of spotting a salamander are greater. Make plans to search for salamanders at night or when the weather is overcast and rainy. Salamanders are nocturnal and can usually be found at night; however, they may also venture out during daytime hours when it is cloudy or raining.

For example, the natural world is full of shadows, forms and silhouettes that can turn into the basis of shape, line and colors for your design. Also, everyday items such windows, food or buildings can inspire ideas for cabinetry, table legs and other furniture elements. Of course, always be inspired by the needs of your customers. Consider how the furniture will be used when determining materials and structure. Also, think about the design aesthetic of your brand. For example, your design style can be contemporary, traditional, country or Victorian. Contrast is the pairing of opposites, such as light and dark or rough and smooth textures to generate visual interest or depth. It can also be used to highlight an important element of a piece of furniture. For example, if the doors on your cabinet feature a signature design element, craft them from a different wood or change the direction of the wood to draw the eye to it. Contrast can be subtle or more obvious, but it should not be overused. Avoid severe, distracting contrast in your pieces. Rather, opt for artful playfulness. Proportion refers to the size and scale of the components of the piece. In addition to size, it also has to do with creating harmony among the colors, shapes and textures. The way that these elements should relate to each other depends on your cultural experience. The eye becomes accustomed to seeing a desirable proportion among elements in nature, especially on the human body. In fact, you probably don't even think about proportion until you see something that looks out of proportion. The Golden Rectangle is a symmetrical relationship that has been used in design for thousands of years and by famous artists such as Salvador Dali, Leonardo da Vinci and the designers of the Parthenon. It is a mathematical concept that makes visual designs more appealing. It is derived from the Fibonacci sequence which is found everywhere in nature, from leaves, to seashells and even the human face. The proportion of the Golden Rectangle is 1:1.618. Shape is also known as form. It is determined by the outline of the piece. Three basic types of shape in furniture are geometric, organic and abstract. Geometric shapes include circles, squares, rectangles and triangles. They are make from straight lines and curves and are often symmetrical. Organic shapes are often asymmetrical and mimic objects found nature, such as leaves or bodies of water. Abstract shapes are artistic representations of forms which may or may not be recognizable. Lines on a furniture define the space and guide the eye around the piece. Depending on the design style, they can be straight or curved, thin or thick, vertical or diagonal. Examine the lines in your pieces to evaluate how they align. Horizontal lines add length and width to a piece. The combination of vertical and horizontal lines add symmetry and balance. Curved lines create movement and add whimsy. Texture is the quality of the surface of the material. Texture can be visual, such as how a piece absorbs or reflects light. It can also be tactile, such as the feeling of fabric on a chair. Patterns are created by the repetition of elements in a piece. You can add pattern with shape, color and texture. When using color, consider its three qualities: hue, value and intensity. In addition, colors can also be described as warm or cool. Color can be added to furniture with paint, stain and textiles or by using different kinds of wood. Hue is the name of the color, such as red, yellow or blue. Value is how light or dark the color is. Light colors can sometimes make furniture appear unstable, whereas dark colors add visual weight. Intensity refers to how bright or dull the color is. In general, warm colors are red, yellow and orange, and cool colors are blue, green and violet.","completion":"Inspiration for design comes from various sources, including nature, everyday items, and customer needs. Design elements to consider include style, contrast, proportion, shape, lines, texture, and color. The Golden Rectangle, with a proportion of 1:1.618, is a timeless concept used to create visually appealing designs. Furniture shapes can be geometric, organic, or abstract, and lines can guide the eye and create balance. Texture and patterns can be incorporated through material surfaces and repetitions. Lastly, color selection should take hue, value, and intensity into account, as well as their classification as warm or cool tones."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Present-day Powder River County was probably first entered by Europeans in the early 1800s in the form of French fur trappers. In the summer of 1865, the United States government sent over 2,000 U.S. soldiers into the Powder River country to combat Native Americans from the Cheyenne people, Lakota people, and Arapaho people tribes. From September 1-15, 1865, the Powder River Expedition (1865) battled Native Americans in the Powder River Battles (1865) near the future site of Broadus. On March 17, 1876, the Battle of Powder River occurred in the south-central part of the county, about southwest of Broadus. In June 1876 six companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States) led by Major Marcus Reno marched along the Powder River nearly to the mouth of the Little Powder before turning west toward the Battle of Little Bighorn. On November 1, 1878, Powderville, Montana became the first establishment in the county, as the Powder River Telegraph Station, on the Fort Keogh to Deadwood, South Dakota telegraph line. On April 5, 1879, the Mizpah Creek Incidents began near the Powderville telegraph station in the extreme northern part of the county. In the early 1880s, a large area of Southeastern Montana became Custer County, Montana, including the present area encompassed by Powder River County. In February 1900, the Broadus post office was established, named after the Broaddus family. In October 1918, publication of a newspaper, the Broadus Independent (now called the Powder River Examiner), began in Broadus, and is still published today. In 1919, Powder River County, Montana was formed from southern Custer County, and in an election in 1920, Broadus was chosen as the county seat of the newly established Powder River County.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Problem:statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.”). The inquiry “must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Claimants argue that their claims do not arise from the purchase or sale of Tele-group’s common stock because a claim “aris[es] from the purchase or sale of ... a security” only if the claim alleges that the purchase or sale of the security was itself unlawful. According to claimants, a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is predicated on conduct that occurred after the purchase or sale. See In re Amarex, Inc., 78 B.R. 605, 610 (W.D.Okla.1987) (<HOLDING>); In re Angeles Corp., 177 B.R. 920, 926 Holding statements: (A) holding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase sale or issuance of the instrument (B) holding that a partnership agreement that contained prohibitions against the sale or assignment of a partners interest in the partnership without the others consent would be enforced (C) holding that a claim for breach of a partnership agreement because it is based on conduct that occurred after the issuance and sale of the partnership units does not arise from the purchase or sale of those units (D) holding that under 510b a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is predicated on conduct that occurred after the securitys issuance (E) holding that claims for breach of fiduciary duty do not arise from the purchase or sale of limited partnership interests where the wrongful conduct occurred after the sale of those interests Solution:","completion":"Based on the problem and the provided holding statements, we can analyze each option step-by-step. (A) focuses on fraud in the purchase, sale, or issuance. This doesn't fit well with the context of the citing text as fraud is not mentioned. (B) discusses the enforcement of a partnership agreement prohibiting the sale or assignment of a partner's interest. This option doesn't involve the purchase or sale of a security and is unrelated to the context of the citing text. (C) relates to a claim for a breach of a partnership agreement based on conduct that occurred after the issuance and sale of the partnership units, stating that it does not arise from the purchase or sale of those units. This option is closer to the argument presented, but it is specifically about partnership agreements and not securities. (D) states that a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is predicated on conduct that occurred after the security's issuance. This option reflects the argument made by the claimants in the citing text that a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is based on conduct that occurred after the purchase or sale. (E) focuses on claims for breach of fiduciary duty not arising from the purchase or sale of limited partnership interests, where wrongful conduct occurred after the sale of those interests. This option is not aligned with the citing text, which discusses securities and not limited partnership interests. The correct answer is (D) holding that under 510b, a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is predicated on conduct that occurred after the security's issuance. This holding statement corresponds to the citing text and the argument made by the claimants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sophie Howes, left, was trying to breast feed her daughter Connie, right) at a Leisure Centre in Kent when the centre manager said it was 'offensive' A mother ordered to stop breast feeding in a swimming pool because staff found it 'offensive' has received a payout from the leisure centre. Sophie Howes, 27, decided to feed her hungry eight-month-old daughter Connie when she started to get restless. The mother-of-two sat down on the steps of the learner pool and began to breast feed the toddler in a bid to calm her down. Within seconds the centre manager Kim Walters came up to her and ordered her to move after the lifeguard reported that she had been 'offended' Miss Howes reluctantly said she would go to the side of the pool but was ordered to go to the changing room if she wished to continue feeding Connie. The midwife, from Ashford, Kent, said staff made her feel 'embarrassed' and 'humiliated'. She claimed the centre had breached the Equality Act 2010, which provides protection for women wanting to breastfeed their children. And now Miss Howes has received an undisclosed pay out from the Ashford Leisure Trust, who run the Stour Centre, after they agreed an out of court settlement. The centre's management said there had been 'no intention to discriminate' against Miss Howes and said the incident was result of a 'misunderstanding.' They said they 'apologised' for any distress caused. She said: 'I decided to take a stance as I believe no woman should be made to feel embarrassed by wanting to breastfeed their child in public. 'Women have rights to be protected from less favourable treatment and to equal access to facilities just because they want to breastfeed their children. 'It's important that when this kind of thing happens we challenge the practices and policies of services providers to ensure it doesn't happen again to others.' Lucy Angus, from Unity Law, represented Ms Howes and said many women aren't aware of their rights. She said: 'This case is important as it gives breastfeeding mums the confidence to know they can challenge discriminatory treatment of this kind. 'Many breastfeeding mums aren't aware of their rights in the same way service providers, such as leisure centres, aren't aware of their legal obligations. This case helps to raise awareness of the issue from both perspectives.' MIss Howes, left won an undisclosed payout from the leisure centre when she was stopped from breastfeeding her daughter Connie, centre. Ms Howes said her mother Virginia, right, was a great advocate of breastfeeding. A manager at the Stour Centre, pictured, intervened when Miss Howes began breastfeeding her child saying a lifeguard had found the action 'offensive' Stopping a woman from breastfeeding in public is specifically outlawed by the Equality Act 2010, pictured. Emma Wood, chief executive of Ashford Leisure Trust, said: 'Ashford Leisure Trust fully supports breastfeeding at all its sites and understands the legal rights of mothers to do this. The Equality Act 2010 is a piece of litigation that protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. Under the Act it is against the law to discriminate against people who are pregnant or who have a child. People are protected when using a public service - such as a swimming pool in this case. According to the Act discrimination includes the following:. 'On this occasion it was believed there was a legitimate health and safety risk - ie, feeding actually taking place while both the mother and baby were in the water, and a suitable alternative area just a couple of metres away was suggested. 'We do of course apologise for any upset caused. The staff were concerned for the health and welfare of the baby. 'It may be that this concern was misplaced due to a misunderstanding of the situation but it was not intended to discriminate against the mother. 'It is clear that additional training is required and this is being arranged with Public Health for all staff to ensure there is an enhanced awareness and understanding of breastfeeding. We will also be working with experts and professionals to ensure that a suitable policy is produced.' Miss Howes said she is 'delighted' with the result and hopes other mothers won't be discriminated against in the way she was. Miss. Howes, whose daughter Connie is now 15 month-old, said: 'I am really. pleased but I am more pleased about the wider implications of it. 'The implication is that mothers won't be discriminated against in other places. 'My mum is a staunch advocate of breast feeding too and we are both midwifes. We both carried on and tried to make a difference. Miss Howes said she was pleased she won her case because it secured extra rights to breastfeed their children in public (picture posed by a model) Ms Howes, left, reached an out-of-court settlement after she claimed she had been discriminated against under the Equality Act 2010 when she was prevented from breastfeeding her daughter Connie, centre. 'I mean this has been happening all over the UK and I'm delighted to be able to set a precedent. 'I used to think people looked positively at breast feeding but then this happened to me and I heard of a lot of similar cases in the press. 'The feeling I got was that breastfeeding was okay as long as you do it secretly which I don't think is acceptable. 'I think there now needs to be a change in the law and make it a criminal offence to tell somebody they can't breastfeed. 'At the moment if somebody asks a person to leave then what can they do. If it's a criminal law then they can tell the police.'

Ordering your go-to Domino's pizza just got a little easier -- yes, even more so than using your XBox One or Pebble smartwatch. The restaurant chain announced Tuesday that its customers will soon be able to order their preferred pie with nary more than a tweet and an emoji. No, seriously. First you'll need to have an online Domino's Pizza Profile and designate an \\"Easy Order\\" pizza. Next, add your Twitter handle to your account and simply tweet #EasyOrder to @Dominos. Or, if that's too many keystrokes for you liking, simply insert the pizza emoji into your tweet instead. Either way, you'll soon get a direct message confirming the order and a piping-hot pizza shortly thereafter. You can give #EasyOrder a whirl today, though unfortunately the emoji method won't to be available until next Wednesday, May 20th. ||||| Ordering a pizza on Domino's can be as easy as a few seconds spent tweeting. (Photo: Domino's) Ordering a pizza is about to get as simple as a tweet. Beginning May 20, Domino's, the pizza delivery behemoth, will roll out a \\"tweet-to-order\\" system for U.S. customers. Domino's will be the first major player in the restaurant industry to use Twitter on an ongoing basis to place and complete an order. Even wackier: Domino's regulars will be able to order by tweeting only the pizza emoji to @Dominos. \\"It's the epitome of convenience,\\" says CEO Patrick Doyle, in a phone interview. \\"We've got this down to a five-second exchange.\\" It's all about attracting busy, younger consumers. For Domino's it was a no-brainer, with upward of 50% of its sales already taking place digitally. One analyst says it's savvy PR. Domino's will enjoy a \\"burst of publicity\\" as social media buzzes with the news, says Rebecca Lieb, digital advertising analyst at Altimeter Group. In the early going, she says, it also gives Domino's a competitive edge. For Twitter, it's an evolution that the online social network is trying to make from a place to chat about or even advertise stuff to a place where folks can buy stuff. Several familiar retailers, including Old Navy and AMC Theaters, have tested selling items on Twitter via \\"buy now\\" buttons on tweets. Twitter keeps looking for ways to grow and engage — and make money on — its more than 302 million monthly active users. Some 500 million tweets are sent every day. And now, tweet-a-pizza. \\"Our hope is that advertisers will keep innovating this way,\\" says Twitter spokeswoman Genevieve Wong. \\"Twitter is the best platform to be creative like this.\\" Among others that have tested promotions of tweets for buying: Starbucks tried \\"tweet coffee to a friend,\\" and the Miami Dolphins tried an in-stadium Tweet-a-Beer promotion where fans could order beer brought to their seats. But Domino's says this is a permanent option for ordering pizza going forward. Over the past few years, Domino's has built a platform to vastly expand its technology, says Doyle. It has amassed a team of about 250 technology employees at its Ann Arbor, Mich., headquarters vs. about 50 tech employees just a decade ago, he says. \\"We want to make it as easy as possible for people to order from us — and this is pretty darned easy,\\" he says. Among other tech-forward ways folks currently can order from Domino's: Samsung Smart TVs, Pebble and Android Wear smartwatches; Ford's SYNC AppLink, and the voice app \\"Dom.\\" Next?

Protecting your bees from predators can ensure the vitality of your colony and a fruitful harvest. Use the following solutions to keep bee predators at bay: Put up electric barriers or chicken-wire fences to keep bears, opossums, and skunks away. Elevate hives to keep opossums and skunks out of the hives. Place birdfeeders away from hives. There may be a slight gap in time between when you introduce your bees to their hive and plants begin producing nectar. During these few weeks, feed your bees with a 1:1 mixture of water and sugar. Punch holes in the top of the hive and hang small food jars with the mixture from them. This can ensure your bees have nutrition until they can access nectar. Check the hive as often as you like. This could be once between spring introduction and fall harvesting or every day if you prefer. This can ensure your hive is flourishing, building a strong comb, and doesn’t have any pests or other problems. During your check-ups of the hive, look for signs of illness, parasite infestation or other animals accessing your hive. This can help you nip potential problems in the bud before they affect your hive. Some signs of issues with your hive include: Misplaced bars Weakened colony Visible hive beetles or wax moths on the comb Lack of larvae Deformed wings . Take out the long, flat hive frames in the fall. Scoop off the honeycomb and wax into a container or bucket with a hot knife. Then allow the honey to gradually sink to the bottom of the container and remove the wax cappings that remain. This will give you delicious, raw honey to eat and wax cappings you can turn into candles or other items. Set the wax capping on a sieve or filter to strain out bits of the capping from the raw honey. Get an extractor if you prefer to strain your honey into a spigot and keep the wax separate. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the given article would be: To protect bees from predators and ensure a healthy and productive colony, several precautionary measures can be taken. These include installing electric barriers or chicken-wire fences to deter bears, opossums, and skunks; elevating hives for additional protection; and placing birdfeeders away from hives. Feeding bees a 1:1 mixture of water and sugar during the initial period before plants produce nectar can also help maintain nutrition. Regular hive inspections are essential for monitoring the colony's health, comb building, and identifying any potential pests or problems, such as misplaced bars, weakened colonies, hive beetles, wax moths, lack of larvae, or deformed wings. During fall harvest, honey and wax can be collected from hive frames, allowing for raw honey and wax-based products like candles to be created.

Answer a question about this article: The \\"Safe Harbor\\" agreement is a voluntary agreement between the private landowner and FWS. The landowner agrees to alter the property to benefit or even attract a listed or proposed species in exchange for assurances that the FWS will permit future \\"takes\\" above a pre-determined level. The policy relies on the \\"enhancement of survival\\" provision of Section §1539(a)(1)(A). A landowner can have either a \\"Safe Harbor\\" agreement or an Incidental Take Permit, or both. The policy was developed by the Clinton Administration in 1999. Are Safe Harbor agreements and ITPs mutually exclusive?","completion":"Safe Harbor agreements and Incidental Take Permits (ITPs) are not mutually exclusive. They are two separate mechanisms designed to address different aspects of the protection and management of endangered or threatened species on private lands. A landowner can have both a Safe Harbor agreement and an ITP in place, depending on their objectives and the specific circumstances of their property. A Safe Harbor agreement is a voluntary agreement between a private landowner and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Under this agreement, the landowner commits to implementing property modifications and management practices that benefit or attract listed (endangered or threatened) or proposed species. In return, the FWS provides assurances that if the landowner's actions result in increased populations of the listed species on their property, they will be allowed future \\"takes\\" of these species above a predetermined level without facing additional restrictions on property use. This policy is based on the \\"enhancement of survival\\" provision of Section 1539(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). On the other hand, an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) is a permit issued by the FWS under Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA, which allows a private landowner to incidentally take or harm a listed species as long as it does not jeopardize the survival of that species and is a result of otherwise lawful activities, such as land development or agriculture. Essentially, an ITP grants a landowner legal immunity for killing, harming, or disturbing protected species if those effects are incidental and not the primary purpose of the activity. To obtain an ITP, a landowner must create and implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) that outlines measures they will take to mitigate and minimize the impacts of their activities on the listed species. In summary, Safe Harbor agreements focus on encouraging landowners to proactively conserve and improve habitat for endangered or threatened species, while ITPs help landowners manage their properties in ways that minimize harm to those species when it is unavoidable during otherwise lawful activities. A landowner can have both a Safe Harbor agreement and an ITP, ensuring that they contribute to conservation efforts while remaining compliant with the ESA and able to continue their land management activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

United Russiaâs Victory Looks to Be Smaller Than Thought James Hill for The New York Times Members of Nashi, a pro-Kremlin youth movement, held a victory rally in Moscow on Sunday night. While there was little question that the party, United Russia, would win the most votes, given its huge structural advantages and weak opposition, the central question was how well it could continue to sell its message of stability to an increasingly weary electorate, now widely empowered by the Internet to gripe about the status quo. With the results still being counted, United Russia declared victory on Sunday evening. “While the 2010-2011 elections in the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal saw the change of ruling parties, we can now say calmly that United Russia remains the ruling party, and I would to thank our voters for that,” Boris Gryzlov, the chairman of the party’s Supreme Council said. But two exit polls suggested that the party was on its way to losing far more seats than anticipated, potentially redrawing the political landscape, with voters expressing a louder-than-expected message of frustration. Mr. Putin along with President Dmitri A. Medvedev made a brief appearance at a subdued meeting at United Russia headquarters. “This is an optimal result which reflects the real situation in the country,” Mr. Putin said, according to Reuters. “Based on this result we can guarantee stable development of our country.” Mr. Medvedev said, according to Reuters, that United Russia, which had previously held a two-thirds supermajority that allowed it to make changes to the Constitution without consulting the opposition, was prepared to forge alliances on the issues. Fatigue with United Russia has been building for years, and the election had been expected to reflect that feeling. And Mr. Putin’s announcement on Sept. 24 that he intended to swap places with Mr. Medvedev next year seemed to annoy voters. The party’s support dipped, and the Kremlin had recently acknowledged that United Russia would almost certainly lose the supermajority. United Russia currently holds 315 seats in the 450-seat Duma, the lower house of Parliament, and the party had said it could lose as many as 75. While Mr. Putin is still expected to easily win a separate presidential election in March, a steep loss for his party on Sunday would reflect flagging support for him as well. Final results were expected on Monday. The party’s supporters said that preserving the current system, with Mr. Putin in charge, was the only prudent course. Galina I. Popkova, 76, said she voted for United Russia to avoid political paralysis. “I think we need to allow one side to be stronger, so that we will move forward, even if that movement is slow,” she said, though she warned that the government needed to start showing results. “Russians, we are like bears, we are so patient,” she said. “But when our patience ends, then we begin to growl.” Darya I. Mychkina, 96, held a United Russia poster showing the faces of Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev. “How can you not vote for these beautiful men?” she asked. But a growing minority of discontented voters voiced their dissatisfaction in numerous ways: voting for any party but United Russia, spoiling their ballots by scrawling political messages on them or boycotting the election. “Today, I am not voting for someone but against someone, because there is no one appealing to vote for,” said Sergei Tarakanov, 62, who stood in the snow in a leather coat and porkpie hat outside a school in central Moscow where he had just cast his ballot. “So I am a protest voter. Today, I am voting against the party of thieves and swindlers.” The election also seemed to mark a new chapter in Russian cyberpolitics. Throughout the campaign, voters used cellphones to record video of heavy-handed politicking, including bribery attempts, campaign law violations and other manipulations, and to then quickly distribute the evidence on the Web. There were also several attacks on political Web sites on Sunday. Golos, the country’s only independent election monitor, which was fined about 1,000 by a Moscow court on Friday for breaking the law by publishing complaints of campaign abuses, had its Web site disabled by a cyberattack on Sunday morning. Reporting was contributed by Ellen Barry, Andrew E. Kramer, Michael Schwirtz, Olga Slobodchikova, Glenn Kates, Sophia Kishkovsky, Nikolay Khalip and Viktor Klimenko. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"United Russia's victory in the elections appears to be smaller than initially anticipated, with exit polls suggesting the party may lose more seats than expected.

Please answer the following question: This story is about a young man.He worked very hard at his lessons.He was too busy to have a rest.At last, he became ill, so he couldn't go to sleep.Every night, when he went to bed, he closed his eyes and tried to sleep.But the more he tried, the more he stayed awake.

A) he hadn't finished doing his lessons B) he had worked too hard and became ill C) he was worried about his homework D) there was a lot of noise there and he couldn't have a good rest A:","completion":"The young man couldn't go to sleep because he had worked too hard and became ill (option B). From the story, we understand that the young man was extremely dedicated to his lessons and spent most of his time studying without taking breaks for rest. His relentless work ethic ultimately resulted in his illness, which disrupted his sleeping pattern. Despite seeking help from a doctor and attempting the suggestion of counting numbers to help him fall asleep, the young man still found himself awake and restless. This indicates that his inability to sleep stemmed from his exhaustion caused by overworking and pushing his body beyond its limits. While options A (he hadn't finished doing his lessons), C (he was worried about his homework), and D (there was a lot of noise there) may contribute to sleep difficulties in some people, none of these options directly attribute to the young man's main problem. In this specific story, his excessive work and subsequent illness are the primary reasons why he couldn't go to sleep, making option B the correct answer. It is important for individuals to find a balance between work and rest, ensuring they maintain good health and avoid physical and mental exhaustion. Overworking oneself may result in health complications and negatively impact daily functions, such as sleeping patterns. Taking regular breaks, engaging in relaxation techniques, and creating a conducive sleeping environment can significantly improve an individual's well-being and sleep quality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

FA Cup: After being rendered obsolete by the redesign, the 1895 replica was presented in 1910 to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird. Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005. It was duly sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 (£478,400 including auction fees and taxes). The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997. The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation. Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display.

Dr. Victor Von Doom (commonly known as Doctor Doom, or simply Doom) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The son of a Romani witch, Von Doom has been depicted as a supervillain, the archenemy of the Fantastic Four, and the leader of the fictional nation called Latveria. While his chief opponents have been the Fantastic Four, he has also come into conflict with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Black Panther, and multiple others. Von Doom has also been depicted as a superhero, being the third character to take up the mantle of Iron Man and joining the Avengers. On many occasions, Doom's only real weakness has been his arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be the reason for his failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom's continued refusal to accept responsibility for the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may have a better understanding of a situation than he does - with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated. Von Doom adheres to a strict code of honor at all times. However, Von Doom will keep his exact word, which may or may not be beneficial to the person to whom he has given his promise. For example, Doom may swear that he will not harm an individual, but that only means he will not personally harm that person; it does not mean he will prevent others from harming that person. Doom's honor code led him to save Captain America from drowning because Captain America had earlier saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means that he will not attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, for no other reason than the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone's hands but his own. Victor von Doom has been shown to be devoted to the welfare and well-being of his subjects. Once, he even went so far as to let his soul lay bare and be judged by the Panther God of Wakanda, who determined that he genuinely wished for a utopian future where humanity thrived, How was doctor doom involved in physchology","completion":"Doctor Doom is a fictional character and not a real person, so he isn't directly involved in psychology. However, we can talk about how his personality and actions can be related to psychology. Doctor Doom is a complex character with high intelligence and a strong desire for power. He often behaves in ways that show his arrogance, and this can be connected to the psychological concept of narcissism. Narcissism is when someone has an inflated sense of their own importance and a deep need for admiration. Doctor Doom's constant need to prove his superiority and blame others for his failures can be seen as signs of narcissism. Also, Doctor Doom's code of honor and devotion to his people indicate that he has some moral values and can make him an interesting character to study in the context of psychology. His actions and personality traits can teach us about different aspects of human behavior, such as motivation, emotion, and relationships with others. So, even though Doctor Doom himself is not involved in psychology, his character can be analyzed and understood using psychological theories and concepts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite as the 2007 World Footballer of the Year. Brazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football. When AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Kaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just 8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Kaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica. A year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. Throughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite. E-mail to a friend.","completion":"1. Brazilian footballer Kaka won the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award, chosen by 96 football journalists. 2.

She's just landed her first major case as a part of the public defender's office - defending a man convicted of a high-profile murder case that's been all over the news. The man, Jack Thompson, is a struggling mechanic who has been convicted of the brutal murder of a successful businessman, Henry Robertson. The movie begins with the reading of the original verdict – a life sentence for Jack. The jurors, the judge, and the prosecution seem satisfied with the result, and Jack's wife, Emma, and daughter, Sophie, weep inconsolably. Sarah, however, believes that Jack is innocent and vows to appeal the decision. Act II: Sarah starts her quest for the truth. She teams up with a seasoned private investigator, Michael \\"Mickey\\" O'Reilly, to take a deeper dive into the case. While re-investigating the evidence and going through the trial transcripts, Sarah discovers inconsistencies in key testimonies and missing links. The duo uncovers new evidence that points to a possible cover-up by the deceased businessman's relatives and business partners – they had motive and opportunity to frame Jack for the murder. As they dig deeper, Sarah and Mickey face threats and warnings from powerful individuals with their interests at stake. Sarah starts to unravel the buried secrets of the powerful Robertson family, finding out that Henry was involved in a series of illegal deals that involved money laundering and tax evasion, which would explain the motive for murder. Act III: Despite the mounting evidence, Jack's case appeal seems like a long shot. Sarah knows she needs much more credibility to face the influential prosecution team. She decides to take a risk and approaches the jurors who originally sentenced Jack, one by one, attempting to convince them of Jack's innocence and the new evidence. This intense strategy and her unwavering determination gradually affect the jurors' perspectives, raising doubts in their minds. Meanwhile, Mickey is hot on the trail of the mastermind behind the conspiracy and discovers one of the jurors from the original trial, who has a connection with the Robertson family. He collects the final pieces of evidence to prove misconduct in the original trial. Act IV: The day finally comes where the appellate court hears Jack's case, with Sarah representing him. In a passionate and powerful closing argument, she lays out the new evidence, exposes the conspiracy, and presents the misconduct of the jury in the original trial. The appellate court, moved by the evidence and the determination of Sarah's pursuit of justice, overturns the original verdict in a unanimous decision, declaring Jack innocent. The true perpetrators behind the murder and cover-up are arrested, and Jack is finally able to go home to his family. The movie ends with Sarah, her reputation established as an unyielding advocate for justice, taking up another case, while Mickey continues his work as a private investigator, the two remaining good friends and upholding their shared values. Unanimous Justice showcases the power of determination, the quest for the truth in the face of adversity, and the resilience of justice when good people stand up for what's right."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do that, we will move the 12502 to the other side of the equation and divide, like this: 329*f = 12502 f = 12502 ÷ 329 Now, let's do the division: 12502 ÷ 329 = 38 And there we have it!

Hypothesis: A man is driving. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Choose from: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","completion":"The hypothesis cannot be concluded as true if the premise is true. Thus, the answer is \\"no.\\" Firstly, let's break down each premise and hypothesis. Premise: A man is standing with his eyes closed. In this statement, we understand two main points: - The man is standing: This means he is on his feet, and his body is upright. Standing usually indicates a static position, not in motion or movement, especially not one like driving which requires sitting and maneuvering a vehicle. - His eyes are closed: This means he is not visually responsive or receptive to his surroundings. Ordinarily, driving would require open eyes for safety and directionality. Hypothesis: A man is driving. This situation dictates that a man is in control of a vehicle, which involves sitting at the driver’s seat, steering the vehicle, and using various controls like the accelerator, brake, and clutch, if applicable. It also requires constant visual awareness for the safety of the driver, the passengers, and others on the road. Highlighting these factors, the premises contradict the hypothesis in multiple ways: - Standing vs. driving: The former implies a stationary, often upright position, while the latter suggests control of a moving vehicle and typically sitting down. - Eyes closed vs. driving: For the safety of the individual and others, driving requires visual alertness, which is impossible with closed eyes. Therefore, based on these contradictions, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Consequently, it is inappropriate to assert that a man standing with his eyes closed is also driving.

Ian Matthias Bavitz (born June 5, 1976), better known by his stage name Aesop Rock, is an American hip hop recording artist and producer residing in Portland, Oregon. He was at the forefront of the new wave of underground and alternative hip hop acts that emerged during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was signed to El-P's Definitive Jux label until it went on hiatus in 2010. betterPropaganda ranked him at number 19 at the Top 100 Artists of the Decade. As a youth, Bavitz and his family would usually commute to New York City. This had a great impact on him and the way he viewed the hip hop culture. Bavitz began rapping in the early 1990s. He cites Public Enemy, BDP, KMD, and Run DMC as early influences. Bavitz also listened to rock acts such as Dead Kennedys, Fugazi, and Ministry; he was introduced to these groups by his older brother Chris. Bavitz started to play instruments such as the piano and bass at an early age. He then eventually acquired a sampler. While attending college, Bavitz initially recorded and released two self-financed efforts, Music for Earthworms (1997), a full-length featuring underground artist Percee P on two tracks. Bavitz also released a music video to \\"Abandon All Hope\\", which was one of the tracks on the CD. The album sold over 300 copies, largely from a grassroots internet-based promotion at his website AesopRock.com and then-popular web portal, MP3.com. With the money he made from his previous release, he then released his Appleseed EP in 1999 which received critical acclaim in the underground hip hop circuit. His early records were mostly produced by long-time friend Blockhead, and underground producer Dub-L. After his breakthrough success in the underground hip hop and indie rap community, he was eventually noticed by the Mush label and obtained his first record deal in 1999, just a year after he graduated from college. Aesop released his first major album, Float (2000), with guest appearances from Vast Aire, Slug, and Dose One. Production was split between Blockhead and Aesop himself, with one track by Omega One. During this time, Aesop worked at a photography gallery. In August 2001 tragedy struck when Bavitz had a nervous breakdown. The song \\"One of Four\\" on his Daylight EP documents his struggles. did he release any other albums?","completion":"Yes, Aesop Rock has released other albums besides Float. After Float, he released these albums: 1. Labor Days (2001): This album was his third full-length album, and it gained him more attention. It also features guest appearances from other artists and has songs about working-class struggles. 2. Bazooka Tooth (2003): This is his fourth album, where he produced most of the music himself. It has guest appearances from other artists like Camp Lo and Mr. Lif. 3. None Shall Pass (2007): This is Aesop Rock's fifth album, and it features guests like John Darnielle and Cage. It also includes production from Blockhead, El-P, and Rob Sonic. 4. Skelethon (2012): This is his sixth album, where he fully produced the entire album himself.

President Barack Obama waved as he boarded Air Force One -- a smaller aircraft on this weekend's run because of the region's runways -- at Asheville, N.C., after meeting with the Rev. Billy Graham at his mountaintop cabin, and heading for Beckley, W. Va., for a memorial service for teh 29 miners who died there. (Photo by Alex Brandon / AP) by Mark Silva at 9:40 am, updated 2:05 pm EDT President Barack Obama, on vacation this weekend in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, made a house call. The president went to vist the Rev. Billy Graham at his North Carolna home, a mountaintop log cabin, this afternoon before leaving for a memorial service for the coal miners killed in the recent West Virginia mining disaster. Obama and Graham had never met in person before. The White House says the two have long tried to get together, and when they last spoke on the telephone -- when the president called the famed evangelist on his 91st birthday lin November -- they agreed to do so as soon as possible. The president left the Grove Park Inn, where he and his family had spent a brief weekend vacation -- the president played golf Saturday morning, and he and First Lady Michelle Obama played tennis this morning -- at 12:16 pm EDT and headed for Graham's house on a beautiful day in the high 60s, a blue sky hoisting fluffy white clouds. \\"Rev. Graham has obviously been an important spiritual leader for past presidents and for the American people for decades,\\" said Bill Burton, a White House spokesman. \\"He's a real treasure for our country. The president apprecites the opportunity to visit him at his home... ounds like (Graham's health is) pretty good. Sounds like he's got some of the creaks that come with advancing age bu the's still as sharp as he ever was... \\"If's a fair guess that they'll pray together,'' Burton said before the meeting. And pray, they did, Burton said after the meeting, reporting that Obama was extraordinarily gratified to have had the chance for their meeting. It lasted about a half-hour. The visit follows close on the heels of the Army last week rescinding an invitation to Graham's son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, to appear at an upcoming National Day of Prayer at the Pentagon because of comments that he has made about Islam. \\"True Islam cannot be practiced in this country,\\" Franklin Graham told CNN's Campbell Brown in December. \\"You can't beat your wife. You cannot murder your children if you think they've committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries.\\" Shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he had called Islam a \\"very evil and wicked religion.\\" Graham, who said a prayer at the inauguration of President George W. Bush, has said he regrets the Army's decision but stands by his comments. \\"I don't like the way they treat women, the way they treat minorities. I just find it horrific. But I love the people of Islam,\\" he said, adding that some of his work has been in Muslim nations. For instance, Samaritan's Purse, the international charity that he heads, works with Iraqi refugees in Jordan. \\"It's a part of the world I love very much,\\" Graham said. \\"And I understand it. But I certainly disagree with their teaching.\\" The Army, which oversees the National Day of Prayer ceremonies, feared that if Graham spoke at the Pentagon, Islamic militants would publicize his comments, potentially fueling tensions in Muslim nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are deployed. Concerns about Graham were flagged by the watchdog group Military Religious Freedom Foundation, which also raised objections that the Pentagon prayer ceremony had become a fundamentalist Christian event. The president left the senior Rev. Graham's cabin at 1:16 pm EDT today and headed to the airport for a flight to Beckley, W., Va. People were standing along the route of the motorcade and waving. Asked whether the military's decision to rescind an invitation to Graham's son was coming up in today's conversation, Burton suggested that would make the visit awkward. ||||| President Barack Obama told the families of 29 miners killed this month that the task for those left behind is “to save lives from being lost in another such tragedy.” Obama, in Beckley, W.Va., on Sunday, delivered the eulogy at a memorial service for the miners killed at the Upper Big Branch Mine earlier this month. ADVERTISEMENT The president avoided placing blame or discussing policy changes, even as Capitol Hill prepares for hearings on changes to mine safety laws. Obama did, however, repeatedly hinted toward efforts to ensure mine safety remains a priority for his administration.\\"How can we fail them? How can a nation that relies on its miners not do everything in its power to protect them?\\" Obama said. \\"How can we let anyone in this country put their lives at risk by simply showing up to work; by simply pursuing the American dream?\\"Obama listed the names of the 29 killed, and he said the nation has \\"been mourning with you throughout these difficult days.\\"\\"Our hearts ache,\\" Obama said.The president said that pursuing tougher safety standards is one way he and lawmakers can honor the dead.\\"We cannot bring back the 29 men we lost,\\" Obama said. \\"They are with the Lord now. Our task, here on Earth, is to save lives from being lost in another such tragedy. To do what must be done, individually and collectively, to assure safe conditions underground. To treat our miners the way they treat each other – like family. For we are all family. We are Americans.\\"The president made these remarks in a state that voted for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in the 2008 presidential race and that also favored Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary. Obama made the trip after meeting and praying with Rev. Billy Graham in North Carolina, where the president enjoyed a brief vacation.Obama has promised a wide-ranging investigation of the accident, and more broadly said the administration would work with Congress to boost enforcement of laws and reform them. Obama also has said the Labor Department would streamline rules that allow regulators to take action against mines with patterns of safety problems.The president remembered the victims as miners who worked a dangerous job to provide for their families.“All the hard work. All the hardship. All the time spent underground. It was all for their families,” Obama said. “For a car in the driveway. For a roof overhead. For a chance to give their kids opportunities they never knew; and enjoy retirement with their wives. It was all in the hopes of something better. These miners lived – as they died – in pursuit of the American dream.”Obama hailed the community spirit that came together after the tragedy, and he spoke of letters he received from miners and miners' families after the explosion.\\"They ask me to keep our miners in my thoughts,\\" Obama said. \\"Never forget, they say, miners keep America’s lights on. Then, they make a simple plea: don’t let this happen again.\\"Obama was joined by Vice President Joseph Biden at the service, where the president spoke of the importance of mining in everyday Americans' lives.\\"Day after day, they would burrow into the coal, the fruits of their labor, what we so often take for granted: the electricity that lights up convention centers like this; that lights up our churches and homes, our schools and offices; the energy that powers our country and the world,\\" Obama said.The president was set to return to the White House on Sunday evening. |||||","completion":"President Obama visited Rev.

Dillon gets pushed while leaving class and drops the sheet on the floor after the test; when the teacher, Mr. Geirasch (Michael Higgins), discovers it, he informs the class that he will fail all of them if the cheater does not confess. He leaves the task of finding the cheater up to the students, led by Van Kelt, the head prefect. When David confronts Dillon and threatens to turn him in if he does not confess, Dillon unsuccessfully attempts to buy David's silence with money. Just when David is about to reveal Dillon to the other students, Dillon accuses David. Both agree to leave and to trust the rest of the class to decide... Answer:","completion":"Considering the detailed plot provided, a possible question about it could be: \\"How does David Greene's attempt to hide his Jewish background at St. Matthew's prep school further complicate the situation when Charlie Dillon is caught cheating on an important history exam in the movie?\\" In the narrative given, David Greene, a working-class Jewish teenage footballer from Scranton, Pennsylvania, hides his Jewish background upon experiencing anti-Semitic prejudice from his friends at St. Matthew's. This decision becomes particularly complex when Dillon, a fellow student and original claimant to Sally's affections, is caught cheating on a history exam, a serious breach of the school's honor code system. When David spots Dillon cheating, he confronts him and threatens to expose him unless Dillon confesses. Instead of doing so, Dillon tries to buy David's silence. The situation escalates when Dillon turns the accusation on David. This scenario intertwines David's concealed religious background and the question of integrity and honor within the school's system, leading to serious implications regarding prejudice, trust, and the concept of justice within the school environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There has been an \\"abrupt rise\\" in the number of cases in England and Wales as people do not realise the risk, scientists advising the government say. Sausages should be cooked for 20 minutes to reach 70C internally to kill the virus, they said. Although serious cases are rare, HEV can cause liver damage or be fatal. Official government figures show there were 124 confirmed cases of HEV in 2003, which rose to 691 cases in 2013. There were 461 cases in the first six months of this year. Symptoms include jaundice and sometimes tiredness, fever, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Most people will get over the virus, although for some, such as those with an immune deficiency disorder, or pregnant women, it can prove fatal. Prof Richard Tedder, at University College London (UCL), said HEV was \\"very common\\" in the UK - not all cases are noticed or recorded. \\"This virus is taking off within the pig herds from which this country sources its processed pig meat in sausages and pork pies,\\" he said. Prof Tedder said sausages needed to be \\"caramelised\\" - cooked thoroughly - before eating to make sure they did not pose a health risk. \\"It's a question of getting people to change,\\" he said. \\"Everybody knows you can get salmonella from chicken.\\" However, he said, the figure of 1 in 10 sausages presenting a potential risk of hepatitis E infection if undercooked should be interpreted with caution. \\"This figure was taken from a small survey (63 sausages), and is unlikely to be representative of the UK as a whole. \\"Given what is known about the prevalence of high viraemia at the time of slaughter in the UK, a more representative figure would be about 1 in 100, or 1% of sausages, and any risk of infection can be alleviated by ensuring sausages are cooked thoroughly.\\" He said the virus occurred in the animal and in the blood system and warned it would continue unless there was a \\"big change\\" in animal practices, such as introducing different hygiene measures. Dr Richard Bendall, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said HEV was the most common virus passed on through animals in Britain. He said the virus was found in 10% of sausages and processed pork meat. This estimate comes from a study that looked at the pork production chain in the UK. Dr Harry Dalton, also at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said the virus was not just confined to pigs, people had caught it from strawberries irrigated with infected water.

Cultural significance: Tennessee has a rich musical history and is home to several cities known for their contributions to the music industry, such as Nashville and Memphis. Due to its musical heritage, it is possible that a large number of fiddles could be present in the state across various music venues, homes, and schools. 3. Misinterpretation: The human might misunderstand the question and think it refers to the colloquial expression \\"to play second fiddle.\\" In this case, they might interpret the question as asking about a location where a significant number of people might figuratively \\"play second fiddle,\\" rather than considering the literal presence of tens of thousands of fiddles. 4. Implicit reasoning: A human could also choose Tennessee due to the sheer size and population of the state, assuming that a larger area with more people would naturally have more fiddles, even though this is not necessarily true. While these reasons might explain why a human would choose Tennessee as the answer to the question, it's important to note that other options like \\"orchestra\\" and \\"music store\\" could be more accurate, as those places are specifically designed to house large numbers of musical instruments, including fiddles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that Amona must be demolished because it is built on private Palestinian land. But hundreds of activists threw stones at and resisted police officers as they moved in to enforce the court order. Hours earlier, the Israeli government approved plans to build 3,000 new homes at settlements in the West Bank. It is the third such announcement since the inauguration 12 days ago of US President Donald Trump, who has hinted he will be more sympathetic to settlement construction than his predecessor. A Palestinian official, Hanan Ashrawi, condemned the latest approval and warned that chances for peace were being destroyed. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. There are also more than 95 outposts - settlements built without official authorisation from the Israeli government - across the West Bank. Located on a hilltop near the settlement of Ofra, north-east of Ramallah, Amona was built in 1996 on land registered as privately-owned by Palestinians. In 2006, following a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court, nine permanent structures in the outpost were demolished, sparking violent clashes between settlers and security forces. In December 2014, the court ordered the Israeli government to completely remove Amona within two years. But the deadline was recently extended until 8 February. The BBC's Yolande Knell, who is at the outpost, says many of the 50 or so Israeli families who have been living there remained in the homes as bulldozers approached on Wednesday. \\"We won't leave our homes on our own. Pull us out, and we'll go,\\" one settler was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. \\"It is a black day for Zionism.\\" The settlers were joined by hundreds of supporters, many of whom confronted the lines of Israeli police acting on the Supreme Court's order. \\"A Jew doesn't evict a Jew!\\" the protesters chanted as they linked arms. By late Wednesday afternoon, 12 families had agreed to leave and 12 houses had been evacuated, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Seven protesters had been arrested and 200 others had been removed from the area, he added. Sixteen officers had also been lightly injured by stones and caustic liquid thrown at them. Our correspondent says the demolition of Amona has proven highly divisive for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition, which includes members who strongly support settlements. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party, called the Amona settlers \\"heroes\\" and said a bill currently before the Israeli parliament that seeks to retroactively legalise other unauthorised outposts would soon be passed. \\"Thanks to the campaign in Amona, thousands of families will be rescued from being evicted from their homes. I call on the pioneers of our generation, the settlers of Judea and Samaria, to lift up your heads,\\" he said, using the Biblical name for the West Bank. The bill is expected to be approved by parliament next week, but it is opposed by Israel's attorney-general and legal experts say it is likely be overturned by the Supreme Court. Summary:","completion":"Israeli police have clashed with activists while clearing the Amona outpost in the West Bank, following a ruling from Israel's Supreme Court that the settlement was built on private Palestinian land, with a Palestinian official warning that peace chances are being destroyed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He encounters an acquaintance on the train there, Antoinette de Mauban, the mistress of the king's treacherous brother, Grand Duke 'Black' Michael. The day before the coronation, Rassendyll is seen by Colonel Sapt and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim. Astounded by the uncanny resemblance between Rassendyll and their liege, they take him to meet Rudolf at a hunting lodge. The king is delighted with his double and invites him to dinner. During the meal, a servant brings in a fine bottle of wine, a present from Michael delivered by his henchman, Rupert of Hentzau. After Rudolf tastes it, he finds it so irresistible that he drinks the entire bottle by himself. The next morning, Sapt is unable to rouse him; the wine was drugged. Sapt is afraid that if the coronation is postponed, Michael will seize the throne. The country is dangerously divided between the supporters of Rudolf and of Michael. The colonel declares that it is Fate that brought Rassendyll to Ruritania; he can take Rudolf's place with no one the wiser.

For instance, the car could have accidentally driven into the water due to poor visibility, or it could be purposely driving through a shallow body of water to reach another location. The presence of a forest fire in the second statement has not been mentioned or implied in the original description, and therefore cannot be assumed to be the motivation behind the car's actions. Ultimately, without further context or details, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the car is driving across the lake to escape a forest fire or if there is another reason for its current situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation. In Scarpia's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious atmosphere, for which Puccini draws on music from his then...

Answer:","completion":"The 9/11 bombings, also known as the September 11 attacks or 9/11, were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks carried out by the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, against the United States on the morning of September 11, 2001. These devastating attacks resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people and caused significant physical, emotional, and economic impact on the United States and the world. On that fateful day, 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes in a planned and meticulously executed operation intended to terrorize the United States. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were flown into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center complex in New York City, causing the collapse of both buildings and resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians, emergency responders, and office workers. The third hijacked plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense, in Arlington County, Virginia. This led to the loss of 184 lives, including both military and civilian personnel. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was believed to be heading towards a target in Washington, D.C., potentially the White House or the Capitol Building. However, due to the heroic actions of passengers on board who attempted to overpower the hijackers, the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all on board. The statement, \\"Although the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks,\\" is indeed a reasonable answer, but it only provides a small part of the complete picture. In the years following the attacks, the United States and its allies launched a series of military operations to combat terrorist networks, most notably the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 to dismantle the Taliban regime, which had provided safe haven to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. A number of measures were also introduced to enhance domestic security, including the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the implementation of new laws and regulations like the USA PATRIOT Act. The efforts to apprehend Osama bin Laden continued for nearly a decade, finally culminating in his death during a raid by U.S. Navy SEALs at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011. The 9/11 attacks have had a profound and lasting impact on the United States and the world at large, influencing foreign and domestic policy, international relations, and the daily lives of millions of people as the fight against terrorism continues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

The best job in the world's competition finally has a winner, Ben Southall, a 34-year-old charity worker from Britain. He beat 34,000 candidates from 200 countries in an online competition that became something of an Internet phenomenon. \\"To go away now as the island caretaker for Tourism Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef is an extreme honour.

Tourism Queensland deliberately chose the middle of winter of the northern globe to launch the campaign back in January, but didn't expect anywhere near the global response. They think the only countries where people didn't visit their website was North Korea and a few African nations.

This description paints a vivid image of a location that's nestled in a valley or ravine, which is characterized by steep sides and thick vegetation. The comparison to an \\"upside-down iceberg\\" seems to be a metaphorical expression used to emphasize the unique shape and appearance of the formation within the forestry environment.

Given the below context: The film tells of two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the Brazilian military government: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, a transgender woman in prison for having sex with an underage boy. Molina, who self-identifies as \\"she,\\" passes the time by recounting memories from one of her favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a Nazi propaganda film. She weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens her up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over her shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if she succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group. When Molina declares herself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades.

SINGAPORE — In an agreement signed Tuesday in Singapore, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while U.S. President Donald Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea. The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement. Asked if the talks included specifics on the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, Trump said “what they have is substantial.” On human rights, Trump said Tuesday’s meetings only very briefly touched on the topic, but that the two sides would discuss it more in the future.

Pick your answer from: * Wrap fishing line around the main stem, down through the rocks, and poke the end of the fishing line through the side of the fibre pot. * Wrap wire around the main stem, down through the rocks, and poke the end of the wire through the side of the fibre pot.","completion":"Between the two options presented, wrapping wire around the main stem, down through the rocks, and poking the end of the wire through the side of the fibre pot is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. Here's a detailed explanation as to why this method is more effective: 1. Strength and Durability: A wire, typically made of metal, is generally stronger and more durable as compared to the fishing line. This means that the wire is more capable of holding the bonsai tree in place, in the long term. The fishing line, usually made of plastic or other synthetic materials, can degrade over time due to environmental factors, such as sunlight and water exposure. Moreover, fishing lines can stretch or break under load, which would compromise the anchoring of the tree. 2. Stability: Given the bonsai tree's delicate nature and the importance of maintaining its shape and growth, wire offers a more stable anchoring solution. Because it is less flexible than a fishing line, the wire will ensure the bonsai tree remains in the desired position. Conversely, the flexibility of a fishing line could allow the tree to move unintentionally or settle unevenly, thereby disrupting the desired aesthetics and growth pattern. 3. Adjustability: The process of anchoring a bonsai tree often requires frequent adjustments to maintain the desired shape and direction. With a wire, adjustments can be made more easily, as it can bend and retain its new shape without losing its holding strength. On the other hand, fishing lines can slip or become loose when adjusting the anchor, resulting in reduced reliability and stability. 4. Aesthetics: Although this point may not be directly related to naive physics reasoning, it is worth mentioning that the wire used for anchoring a bonsai tree can contribute to its overall aesthetics. Wires used for bonsai trees are often available in various colors and can blend in with the tree's branches, thus not detracting from the overall visual appeal. In contrast, fishing lines are usually transparent or colored in a way that may not be aesthetically pleasing for displaying a bonsai. In conclusion, anchoring a bonsai tree using a wire is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it provides greater strength, durability, stability, and adjustability compared to a fishing line. While both methods may achieve the objective of anchoring the tree, the wire method offers a more effective and reliable solution, taking into consideration the unique needs of a bonsai tree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The report is about experiments which transplant human cells into animals for medical purposes. It claimed that concerns about the creation of talking apes should be taken seriously. It should also draw people's attention to the possibility that the medical research about creating \\"humanised\\" animals is going to generate monsters. A regulatory body is needed to closely monitor any experiments that many risk creating animals with human-like consciousness or giving them any appearance or behavioural traits that too closely resemble humans, the report said. Scientists would, for example, be prevented from replacing a large number of an ape's brain cells with human brain cells until more is known about the potential risks. This has already been done in simpler animals like mice, which is judged to be less risky. Under the new UK guidelines, the power to regulate tests on animals containing human material would be transferred to a body with wider responsibility for animal testing in the Home Office. While there is no risk from experiments currently being carried out in Britain, it is possible that ethical boundaries could be crossed within the next few years if scientists are not careful, the experts said. Professor Thomas Baldwin, a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences working group that produced the report, said the possibility of humanised apes should be taken seriously.

The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture. Which land had fewer soil microorganisms consuming oxygen faster than diffusion occurs? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, when soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, which means that soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. This characteristic is associated with wetlands. Since the Eastern land is covered in wetlands, it is likely to have more hypoxic soils compared to the Western land with rich soil good for agriculture.

What are some of the most beautifully written poems ever? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Determining the most romantic poem ever written is highly subjective, as personal preferences and cultural differences can influence one's interpretation of romance. However, one poem that is frequently considered one of the most romantic is \\"How Do I Love Thee?\\" (Sonnet 43) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The poem is an expression of the depth and intensity of love the speaker feels for her beloved. Here is the poem: How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right. I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. As for some other beautifully written poems, this question is also subjective. However, some classic poems that are widely regarded for their beauty and craftsmanship include: 1. \\"Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night\\" by Dylan Thomas: A powerful poem about the human desire to resist death and live life to the fullest. 2. \\"Daffodils\\" (I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud) by William Wordsworth: A charming portrayal of the beauty of nature and its ability to soothe the soul. 3. \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" by T.S. Eliot: A modernist poem that explores self-doubt, indecision, and the complexities of the human experience. 4. \\"The Road Not Taken\\" by Robert Frost: A contemplative poem about choice, regret, and the paths we choose in life. 5. \\"Kubla Khan\\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge: A vivid and imaginative poem inspired by a dream, illustrating the power of artistic creation. As for the difference between the two questions, they share some overlap but ultimately carry distinct meanings. The first question focuses specifically on romantic poetry, seeking examples that evoke love, passion, and devotion. The second question is broader, asking for examples of beautifully written poems, which could encompass various themes beyond romance, such as nature, spirituality, or personal reflection. While the first question emphasizes the emotional context and content of a poem, the second question emphasizes the aesthetic qualities, language, and poetic technique."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the album released in 1994 by the band from Athens, Georgia? , can you please find it? R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill...

Here is an article: Last week I listened to an episode of Digital Detectives, a great series of podcasts co-hosted by Sharon Nelson and John Simek of Sensei Enterprises, Inc., who spoke at length with attorney and e-Discovery expert Josh Gilliland, author of the noted Bow Tie Law blog. What are the five hottest topics in e-Discovery today? Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f) mandates that parties “meet and confer” in a meaningful manner. Meeting and conferring is extraordinarily important in cases involving e-Discovery and should never be a one-time event, according to Gilliland. One of the central points of procedural discussion with respect to electronically stored information is the form in which ESI is to be produced. Gilliland warns against requesting all metadata lest an attorney be faced with documents with unlimited fields. Cooperation, open communication, and transparency should take the place of gamesmanship, which also means agreeing up front that the parties won’t engage in sanctionable behavior such as producing unsearchable, unusable documents, e.g., static images or others stripped of metadata. Where native file production is expected, the parties should discuss the cost of producing and reviewing any given volume of relevant documents. 2. How Can Small Firms Survive Their Entry Into E-Discovery? It can be difficult for solo practitioners or mid-sized firms to get up to speed with e-Discovery, which is especially problematic when doing so isn’t part of the implementation of processes generally, but rather is a matter of necessity when a case arises. In this regard, Gilliland expresses dismay at a common response from lawyers who practice only in state courts: “I don’t need to worry about it.” Nonsense. I recently heard the same comment during an interview with an attorney who works in a small market, but the nature of whose growing practice will no doubt see him in federal court. Gilliand adds that there is generally a lack of affordable tools for smaller firms, but said that there is now a growing set of desktop document review solutions. Moreover, cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions make review affordable for solo practitioners, as one can scale up or down quickly and on demand. 3. Litigation Holds After Pension Committee In Pension Committee of the University of Montreal Pension Plan v. Banc of America Securities (S.D.N.Y. 2010), Judge Shira Scheindlin, author of the Zubulake cases and one of most highly respected judges when it comes to e-Discovery, addressed the issues of the duty to preserve documents and the penalties for failure to do so. The court held that failure to issue a written legal hold constitutes negligence per se. Judge Scheindlin’s opinion doesn’t end the inquiry, as Judge Paul Grimm’s opinion in Victor Stanley Inc. v. Creative Pipe Inc. (D. Md. 2010) noted that Pension Committee’s “requirement of a written legal hold in all cases, when combined with its holding that gross negligence can gißve rise to a presumption of relevance and prejudice, operates to create a de facto finding of spoliation every time a party fails to issue a written legal hold.” William K. Dodds, Philip B. Yanella & Ben Barnett, Pension Committee–One Year Later (New York L. J. Mar. 24, 2011) (quoting Victor Stanley II) (“[I]f a party fails to issue a written litigation hold, the court finds that it is grossly negligent, in which case relevance and prejudice are presumed. Point. Game. Match.”). Indeed, Gilliland notes that judges are introducing rationality into this bright line rule vs. case-by-case analysis debate, and that failure to issue a litigation hold “is not an instant death sentence.” In Davis v. Grant Park (D.D.C. Nov. 2010), for example, Magistrate Judge John Facciola struck down a motion for sanctions for alleged destruction of ESI on the basis that it is “premature to consider the question of sanctions until discovery ends and the Court can assess accurately what prejudice, if any, the loss of electronically stored information has caused.” There must be actual prejudice. The Pension Committee standard is already evolving. 4. Preservation and Collection of Electronically Stored Information “Put down your knives,” advises Gilliland, who adds that a dearth of case law has left this area of e-Discovery poorly understood. He prescribes what seems perfectly rational absent a rule that states that every hard drive should be produced via bit-by-bit imaging — the process of preservation and collection should be proportional. Thus, for example, for an individual person, Gilliland says that one could produce a target collection of specific folders and emails in a forensically sound manner. The kicker, however, is that no attorney wants to be the test case to argue that target collection is defensible, especially when defending the interests of corporate clients. 5. How To Prove That An E-Discovery Request Will Cause An “Undue Burden” Gilliland believes that McBride v. Halliburton (D.D.C. 1995) might be the default standard here. In McBride, Magistrate Judge Facciola pointed to the court’s obligation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2)(C) to balance on a fact-specific basis the utility of discovery against costs even where said discovery is likely to yield relevant evidence. In that case, the defendant, although clearly possessing greater resources than the plaintiff, had “already spent a king’s ransom on discovery” in the amount of 650,000 before attorneys’ fees. Data collections were located offsite. Overseas employees would have had to ship data over network connections with finite capacity, which could have required an average of two to 10 days to collect an average of 15-20 gigabytes of data per custodian. Then processing, then de-duplication, then searches for relevance and to ascertain whether any privileges could be claimed. The court thus stated: “Without any showing of the significance of the non-produced emails, let alone the likelihood of finding the ‘smoking gun,’ the [plaintiff’s] search demands cannot possibly be justified.” If we can extract a broad principle from this, Gilliland states, it is that courts will ask a number of questions: ● Why will discovery be expensive? ● Where is the data? ● What processes are necessary to review it? ● What needs to be done to preserve it? ● How many hours will it take to review the produced documents? He adds that answering these questions in a manner that weighs against discovery “does not get you a get-out-of-jail-free card.” Precedents exist requiring parties to conduct reasonable review even if unduly burdensome. Gilliland asserts that one of the big factors here is evolving technology. For example, whereas many attorneys feel that backup tapes are not accessible as a matter of right, technology has reached the point where one can go through them at far lower costs than previously possible. When it comes to e-Discovery, one could come up with a list of five, 10, or 20 hottest topics. The flood of daily developments and the speed at which this area of law is developing astound me. There are few things I enjoy as much as learning, and the opportunity to do so from three experts was an invaluable one.

Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine. After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of \\"state\\" and \\"government.\\" It was decided that \\"state\\" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term \\"government\\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many points were scored in total by halftime?","completion":"Title: A Deep Dive into the Halftime Points Phenomenon: Unraveling the Numbers Introduction There's something about the halftime event that enthralls spectators and fans alike during any sports game. It's not just the anticipation of waiting to see which team will come out on top, but also the significant milestone that the halftime score represents. This article aims to answer the burning question: How many points were scored in total by halftime? Step 1: Determine the Sport The first step towards determining the total number of points scored by halftime is identifying which sport we are referring to. This is crucial as different sports have varying points systems and halves. For example, basketball and football have different scoring rules and ways through which points can be earned. Step 2: Analyze the Match Data Once the sport has been identified, we will need to analyze the specific match data to have accurate figures for the points scored. This would involve collecting information on points scored, fouls, penalties or any other occurrences that might impact the points in the game. The source of reliable data can be official match records, renowned sports websites, or other trusted databases. Step 3: Summing Up the Points Once we have the vital information on points scored, we can proceed to tally up the total points achieved by both teams by halftime. We will need to keep track of all the different methods through which points were formed, and the conversion of individual scores to single points. It’s essential to note that some sports have scoring systems where a single score equals several points; this crucial detail must be accounted for. Step 4: Factoring in Exceptions and Special Cases In some sports, certain conditions or events can lead to deductions or additions to the total points scored. Such cases can include controversies, rule breaches, or even amendments by officials. Before reaching the final figure, we must ensure all these factors are taken into account and the total points scored are accurately and fairly determined. Conclusion The total number of points scored by halftime is something that encompasses different aspects of the game and is influenced by the sport in question. By following a step-by-step approach, starting with ensuring the correct sport, analyzing match data, and summing up the scores, we can reach a conclusive total points scored in a specific game. It is essential to remain diligent and detail-oriented throughout this process to provide an accurate and honest representation of the halftime points phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The election course is complicated, and the road to the Oval Office is long. Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party's recommendation; delegates then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences. Before that, however, each state holds a primary election that determines how the state's voters want the party's delegates to vote. Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state. At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year.

Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...

Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more antiretroviral drugs? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Nigel received more antiretroviral drugs. This is because he was infected with the HIV virus, which is a type of retrovirus. Antiretroviral drugs are specifically designed to treat retroviruses, such as HIV, by inhibiting their replication and reducing the viral load in a patient's body. These medications work by targeting specific enzymes essential to the life cycle of the virus, thereby reducing the likelihood of the virus multiplying and causing further damage to the immune system. On the other hand, Manny had contracted a bacterial infection, which would typically be treated with antibiotics, not antiretroviral drugs. Antibiotics work by targeting different aspects of bacterial cells, such as cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, or DNA replication. This helps to stop the growth and replication of the bacteria, ultimately clearing the infection from the body. Thus, due to their distinct medical situations, Nigel would have received more antiretroviral drugs than Manny, as they are specifically intended for addressing viral infections like HIV.

Scenario 1: A woman is picking up a large rock to show her friend, a man, who is sitting on another rock nearby. In this case, the man's presence is connected to the woman's action, but the situation is not conclusive based on the initial premise alone. Scenario 2: A woman is picking up a large rock to move it, since a man is coming to sit on the location where the rock currently is. The man might end up sitting on a different rock when the task is accomplished.

Scenario 3: A woman and a man are participating in a competition, where the woman needs to pick up large rocks and the man has to sit on them. This scenario presents a direct link between the two situations, but this specific information was not provided in the original premise.

Question: This article: When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine. He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \\"She Loves You\\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February; he also used it when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \\"Nowhere Man\\".In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \\"Bebopalula\\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \\"Rocky\\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul, which Harrison nicknamed \\"Lucy\\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \\"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used a Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help!, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who used a Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help! album is George. This person is George Harrison, who was a member of the Beatles and a talented guitarist. He obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and used it during the recording of the Help! album in February of that year. He also used the Fender Stratocaster when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \\"Nowhere Man\\". George Harrison's extensive use of various guitars throughout his career reflects his expertise and passion for music, which contributed to the Beatles' iconic sound and his successful solo career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What have the various models been of?","completion":"The various models mentioned in the article are focused on predicting the impacts of climate change on the Alps, particularly within the context of the 22nd century. These models employ sophisticated scientific data, methods, and assumptions to generate comprehensive projections for various aspects of the Alpine environment. These aspects encompass: 1. Temperature: By analyzing historical data and accounting for factors that influence temperature changes, such as greenhouse gas emissions, these models predict the potential rise in temperature in the Alps over the coming decades. Warming trends may vary depending on emission scenarios, with higher emissions potentially leading to greater temperature increases. 2. Snowfall: Climate models evaluate changes in precipitation patterns, including both the amount and distribution of snowfall across the Alps. As temperatures rise, the models explore how rainfall will replace snowfall at certain altitudes, leading to a reduction in snow cover and an overall decrease in the snow season's duration. 3. Snowpack: With anticipated temperature increases and shifts in precipitation patterns, these models examine the future dynamics of the Alpine snowpack. This includes analyses of how warmer temperatures may change the snowpack's structure, leading to earlier melting, runoff, and overall reduced water storage capacity. 4. Glaciation: The models also investigate the impact of increased temperatures on Alpine glaciers. Projections for glacier retreat, mass balance, and the potential consequences of reduced glacial volume can be estimated by analyzing historical data and incorporating factors such as future precipitation shifts and rising temperature trends. 5. River runoff: As changes in snowfall, snowpack, and glaciation impact the hydrological cycle in the Alps, climate models evaluate the effects on river runoff. By factoring in alterations to precipitation patterns, melting rates, and glacier shrinkage, models predict potential shifts in river runoff volume and temporal patterns that could have significant ramifications on ecosystems, water resources, and human activities. In summary, the various models of climate change for the Alps focus on predicting the impacts of rising temperatures on key aspects of alpine environments, such as snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff, throughout the 22nd century. By examining different climate change scenarios and considering various factors that contribute to the warming of the planet, these models contribute to a deeper understanding of how the Alps may be affected in the future and inform potential mitigation and adaptation strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Louisiana has the third highest rate in the United States of school employees accused or convicted of inappropriate relationships with students, according to data compiled by a former top official in the U.S. Education Department. In 2014, 23 cases were reported in Louisiana, placing the state behind only Alabama and Kentucky on a per-capita basis. LIVE CHAT Terry Abbott answered NOLA.com readers' questions in the comment stream below this story. The numbers come from Terry Abbott, who was chief of staff to Education Secretary Rod Paige for 10 months during President George W. Bush's first term and previously worked as Paige's press secretary in the Houston Independent School District. Last year, Abbott's public relations firm, Drive West Communications in Houston, tracked U.S. news media reports about inappropriate relationships between teachers and students and compiled a database of 781 incidents. \\"Fifteen times a week, a school employee is convicted or accused of inappropriate relationships with students,\\" Abbott said. \\"Fifteen times every week in this country.\\" The incidents run the gamut. Some school workers make lewd comments or grope students. Some send obscene electronic messages or pictures. At the most extreme, school employees have sex with students. That was the case, police say, with two Destrehan High female teachers who are accused of having group sex with a 16-year-old male student. The story made international headlines and sparked a debate on whether society judges teacher-student relationships with a double standard, depending on the gender of the people involved. Of the 23 cases reported in Louisiana last year, 11 were in the New Orleans or Baton Rouge areas, including two involving the Destrehan High teachers, according Abbott's data. The average age of the student involved was 15, Abbott said. \\"A lot of folks, unfortunately when they look at these cases involving educators being sexually involved with students, they look at the cases and say \\"Oh, well those kids are old enough. They know what they are doing.\\" ... They are 15 ; those are children. And that should never ever be tolerated.\\" The 23 Louisiana cases equate to one for every 202,160 residents of the state. Still, Abbott says the number is indicative of an alarming trend: The number of reported sexual incidents involving school employees and students who use social media to facilitate the contact. \\"We don't characterize this as a scientific study, because it's not,\\" Abbott said. \\"But we look at media reports every day in every state, we cataloged every single thing we found and we see a number of very, very, concerning trends.\\" \\"We're seeing way too many cases happening way too frequently. And we're seeing the thing that should worry every parent, ... so many of these cases starting or being helped along by social media.\\" Already this year, Abbott said his firm has tracked six new cases in Louisiana. \\"That's just within the first 22 days of 2015,\\" Abbott said. In most of the 2014 cases around the country, and specifically in Louisiana, Abbott said the use of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Kik, and the use of text messages, play an integral role. He says schools must establish strong policies and rules against employees communicating directly with individual students via social media and text messages. \\"I've been telling educators and media around the country we believe social media is the No. 1 new tool of classroom sexual predators,\\" Abbott said. Abbott said a music teacher in Pennsylvania was recently arrested on charges of sending more than 90,000 social media messages to a 15-year-old student over a 11/2-year period before the girl told her parents. \\"They calculated that this teacher was sending about 300 messages a day to this student. That included videos and pictures that were obscene,\\" Abbott said. Nationally, the percentage of inappropriate incidents involving social media was 36 percent, and in Louisiana it was 39 percent, Abbott said. Louisiana also tracked higher than the national average in the percent of incidents that involved women school employees, he said. In Louisiana, 41 percent of the 23 cases involved women, compared to 33 percent nationally, his data indicated. The numbers indicate that women were more likely than men to use social media in communicating with students, Abbott said. Overall, however, more men than women are formally accused or charged with a crime, he said. Abbott said his research also debunked a commonly held belief, that many of the school employees involved in such incidents were rookie teachers. Nationally, the average age of the school employees who were accused was 32, he said. \\"These are teachers who have been in the classroom 10 years or more,\\" Abbott said. \\"On the average these are not brand new teachers who are real close in age to the students and who don't know what they are doing.\\" On this interactive map, click on a dot to learn more details.

Kimberly Naquin, 26, has been in jail since she was booked Thursday night with carnal knowledge of a 16-year-old girl -- in a school classroom, among other locations -- and prohibited sexual conduct between a student and educator. \\"Unfortunately, sexual abuse is active in all aspects of our society,\\" Sheriff Greg Champagne said. \\"Sexual abuse is not any better now than it's ever been.\\" Naquin, who lives in Destrehan and whose father is School Board President Dennis Naquin, was arrested 15 months after two other Destrehan High teachers, Shelley Dufresne and Rachel Respess were accused of having sex with a 16-year-old male student. Dufresne, daughter of a state judge, has pleaded guilty to one charge in St. Charles Parish; she and Respess have pleaded not guilty in a related case in Jefferson Parish. Champagne said the Sheriff's Office learned of the Naquin allegations Wednesday at 8 a.m. when a 17-year-old girl's relative disclosed the teen had a sexual relationship with one of her teachers. The teen told investigators the relationship began in September 2014, when she was 16, and continued to August. That means Naquin is accused of continuing a sexual relationship with her student 10 months after colleagues Dufresne and Respess were arrested in October 2014. Under Louisiana criminal law, 17 marks adulthood and generally is the age of consent for sex. Teachers are further forbidden to have sex with a student aged 17 to 21. The teen said most of the inappropriate conduct occurred at Naquin's prior residence in Kenner, where police say they are holding warrants to arrest her on 10 more charges of sex with a juvenile. An undetermined number of incidents happened in St. Charles Parish in a Destrehan High classroom and at a Destrehan residence, Champagne said. Naquin was the faculty adviser to Destrehan High's Beta Club chapter. When investigators sought Thursday to question her, they learned she was at a Beta Club convention in Lafayette with other teachers and students, Champagne said. She returned with detectives to St. Charles to cooperate with the investigation. Champagne said the investigation remains open. The school's website says Naquin was a fourth-year teacher of Advanced Placement human geography and world geography. Champagne said her father told authorities Thursday night he was \\"distressed\\" by the accusations and \\"he would offer his cooperation in anyway.\\" ||||| Picking up lunch at a Destrehan Subway on Friday (Jan. 15), Dustin Millet said what many people are thinking about this Mississippi River town of 11,535, just after another teacher was accused of having sex with a student - from a single school. \\"It's crazy,\\" he said. \\"Third one in two years? It's pretty unbelievable that it still goes on.\\" Louisiana already had a bad reputation for inappropriate relationships between school staff and students: In 2014, it ranked third in the United States, counting both convictions and arrests. That included Shelley Dufresne and Rachel Respess, who taught English at Destrehan High until their arrests that fall on charges of having group sex with a 16-year-old boy. Their ranks were joined Thursday night by geography teacher Kimberly Naquin, 26, booked with 12 counts of carnal knowledge of a teenage girl who was one of her students -- including one instance in a classroom. The St. Charles Parish public school system has sterling academic credentials, and this third case strikes at its heart: Naquin's father is School Board President Dennis Naquin, and her mother teaches at Destrehan's Harry Hurst Middle. Law enforcement officials said the latest victim told them her relationship with Naquin started in September 2014, when the girl was 16, and continued until August. That means Naquin is accused of carrying on a sexual relationship with her student for 10 months after the \\"Destrehan teacher sex abuse\\" headlines began circling the globe. Louisiana law generally forbids sex between an adult and a person younger than 17. It strictly prohibits sexual contact between a teacher and a student through the age of 20, and it's very clear how seriously school systems should treat abuse. But the laws and policies do not necessarily include consequences for the higher-ups. Destrehan High Principal Stephen Weber, for example, kept his job after the 2014 abuse came to light. And the state Education Department did not contact, sanction, reprimand or intervene at the school, spokesman Barry Landry said. He would not release Weber's annual evaluation results, saying they were not public information; the 2014-15 results aren't complete yet anyway. Judging from the minutes of its meetings, the School Board did not discuss the Dufresne and Respess case publicly that fall, although Superintendent Felecia Gomez-Walker did reassure families Nov. 5 that the school system had a complete plan in place for \\"precautionary measures regarding the Ebola virus.\\" Instead, local and state officials put the emphasis Friday on individual cases. They said Respess and Dufresne had faced the music -- both are being prosecuted -- and Naquin will now be investigated and treated in the same way. Kenner adds 10 student-sex charges against Destrehan teacher \\"The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education revoked the licenses of two previous St. Charles Parish teachers, assuring these teachers will never again hold a valid teaching license in Louisiana,\\" state Education Superintendent John White said. \\"We take these accusations very seriously and will consider similar sanctions at the appropriate time under Louisiana law.\\" Naquin has been suspended without pay, and school system administrators are conducting an internal investigation, school system spokeswoman Stevie Crovetto said. She would give only limited information, saying these were \\"personnel issues.\\" St. Charles policy, based on state law, requires that school staff learning of sexual misconduct must immediately report it to their boss and the police. If a school employee is accused of a \\"moral offense,\\" the superintendent or designate must investigate swiftly, obtaining statements from all parties by the end of the next working day. Victims of staff sexual misconduct are offered counseling, Crovetto said. It appears that the St. Charles policy is behind the times in one point. The parish prohibits sexual contact between teachers and students who are 17 to 19 years old, whereas the state law was strengthened in 2009 to include 20-year-olds. As for parish-wide efforts to create a healthy school climate, it seemed that Weber, the principal, was doing something. St. Charles school employees take an annual online course reviewing policies and procedures, including those concerning sexual misconduct, Crovetto said, and Weber was among the principals who \\"choose to do additional training to reinforce the details of policy and procedure with faculty each year,\\" she said. Weber did not respond Friday to an emailed request for comment. A Destrehan High senior, who withheld her name because she is applying for college, said the school closely monitored contact between students and teachers. Teachers and students are mostly prohibited from texting each other, she said. When she texts her coaches, they must document it with the office. Louisiana No. 3 for inappropriate teacher-student relationships \\"They definitely have stuff in place. It's not like people are running around contacting teachers,\\" she said. She deemed Destrehan High an excellent school. The sexual abuse \\"wasn't a big school issue,\\" she said. \\"It's just a few individuals making bad decisions.\\" But three teachers in 15 months? Even Sheriff Greg Champagne was puzzled. \\"That's maybe a question for Dr. Phil,\\" he said. . . . . . . . Wilborn P. Nobles III contributed reporting. ||||| DESTREHAN, La. -- It’s another alleged case of sex between a teacher and student at Destrehan High School. This case involves 26-year-old Kimberly Naquin, a geography teacher at the school. Last night she was arrested and booked with carnal knowledge of a juvenile and prohibited sexual contact between a student and educator. Parents at Destrehan High were in disbelief that the school was dealing with a situation like this, again. “I guess they have to do better screenings of the teachers and their backgrounds, security background check like they do at the federal government,\\" said Carmen Ibert, a parent at the school. but I guess you can’t prevent it from happening” “It’s very sad to hear it happened again, especially here at Destrehan where my daughter attends,” Gene Hyorth, another parent from the school. Sheriff Gregg Champagne of St. Charles Parish says the sexual relationship with the female student took place when the girl was 16 and 17 years old “The relationship began in August of 2014, and continued until September of 2015, at which time we understand the relationship had been terminated for some reason.” Investigators say Naquin had sex with the student in a classroom at the high school, a residence in Destrehan, and at Naquin’s former residence in Kenner. This is the fourth Destrehan teacher arrested for having sex with a student over the past ten years. Clinical psychologist Dr. Michelle Moore worries parents will begin losing trust in the school system. “I think all schools in general should really have an in-service with teachers to be able to talk about appropriate boundaries with students, and appropriate professionalism at school,\\" said Moore. \\"I think part of that will sure up parents so that they know they can trust the schools where they’re sending their children to.” Because part of the relation between Naquin and the student took place at her former residence, she is facing 10 additional felony counts in Kenner.

One fresh-faced activist suggests an Easy-Bake Oven. McKenna, 13, is petitioning toy maker Hasbro to stop marketing the kitchen set only to young girls, asking for images of boys to also be placed on Easy-Bake boxes. The Garfield, N.J., eighth-grader, moved to action by her 4-year-old brother’s attempts to cook on top of a lamp’s light bulb, has already scored nearly 18,000 signatures on her petition on Change.org. On the petition, McKenna writes that she found the lack of packaging or promotional materials featuring boys to be “quite appalling.” The girlie purple and pink colors used on Easy-Bake Ovens didn’t help either. “I feel that this sends a clear message: women cook, men work,” she wrote. “I want my brother to know that it’s not ‘wrong’ for him to want to be a chef.” As McKenna points out, many of the top figures in the culinary industry are men -- behemoths such as Emeril Lagasse, Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck and many more. On Hasbro’s website, the Easy-Bake brand is included under Cooking & Baking Games for Girls. To really pound her point home, McKenna uploaded an adorable video where she goads her brother into explaining the trouble with wanting an Easy-Bake Oven (he also hopes for a dinosaur). “Only girls play with it,” he says, while attempting to bake cookies.

Or are they? For the first time in Barbie’s more than 50-year history, Mattel is introducing a Barbie construction set that underscores a huge shift in the marketplace. Fathers are doing more of the family shopping just as girls are being encouraged more than ever by hypervigilant parents to play with toys (as boys already do) that develop math and science skills early on. It’s a combination that not only has Barbie building luxury mansions — they are pink, of course — but Lego promoting a line of pastel construction toys called Friends that is an early Christmas season hit. The Mega Bloks Barbie Build ’n Style line, available next week, has both girls — and their fathers — in mind. “Once it’s in the home, dads would very much be able to join in this play that otherwise they might feel is not their territory,” said Dr. Maureen O’Brien, a psychologist who consulted on the new Barbie set. Consumer surveys show that men are increasingly making the buying decisions for families, reflecting the growth in two-income households and those in which the women work and the men stay home. One-fifth of fathers with preschool-age children and working wives said they were the primary caretaker in 2010, according to the latest Census Bureau data. And 37.6 percent of working wives earned more than their husbands in 2011, up from 30.7 percent 10 years earlier. “Kids are going to grow up with dads that give them baths and drive them to soccer and are cutting up oranges for team snacks,” said Liz Ross, president for North America of BPN, part of the IPG Mediabrands holding company, which recently completed a study on male consumers. “What will go away, albeit slowly, is the image or the perception of the befuddled dad.” The change is having consequences beyond toys. Consumer products have traditionally been marketed to appeal to women, and stores have been designed for women’s sensibilities. Now, some brands and stores are catering directly to male decision-makers. Sears is reorganizing stores to put tools next to work wear, for instance, based on men’s preferences. Procter & Gamble is working on men’s grooming aisles at top retailers, a nod to the fact that women are no longer choosing shampoos or shaving creams for their husbands. With the selling point that it helps girls develop spatial reasoning, the Barbie set, a joint effort of Mattel and the toy company Mega Bloks, is also meant to pique fathers’ interest. “Dad is a bigger influencer in terms of toy purchases over all, and this sets up well for that, because the construction category is something Dad grew up with and definitely has strong feelings and emotions about,” said Vic Bertrand, chief innovation officer of Mega Brands, Mega Bloks’ parent company. Construction sets for girls are a speedy growth category, thanks to Lego’s introduction of its Friends line in January. Despite criticism that those sets were sexist — themes include a beauty shop and a fashion studio — Lego’s chief executive said in August that the company sold twice as many of the sets in the first half of the year as it had expected, and retailers like Amazon and Target have named them hot holiday toys. Anne Marie Kehoe, vice president of toys for Walmart U.S., said that, with the Barbie addition, construction toys aimed at girls will represent about 20 percent of the toy construction category by the end of this year, while last year there were just a handful of products. Research shows that playing with blocks, puzzles and construction toys helps children with spatial development, said Dr. Susan C. Levine, chairwoman of the psychology department at the University of Chicago and co-principal investigator at the National Science Foundation’s Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center. Even controlling for other skills such as verbal and numerical skills, she said, children with better spatial thinking are more likely to eventually go into mathematics, engineering, science and technology. She said that a set aimed at girls could be beneficial, if only because it might increase girls’ likelihood of participating in construction activities. Dr. O’Brien, the consultant on the new Barbie set, said adults had traditionally been “the limiting factor” in why girls have not played with those toys as often. Recently, she said, there has been a shift in attitudes, as parents study research on development and spatial play. “For this particular product, one of the advantages is you can appeal to both moms and dads,” she said of the construction set. During her research, Dr. O’Brien said, she watched a grandfather jump in to explain building principles to his granddaughter, who was playing with the Barbie. Still, the construction set is not exactly dump trucks and dirt. It remains “unapologetically all girl,” said Stephanie Cota, senior vice president of global marketing for Barbie, girls’ brands and games at Mattel. The Mega Bloks building pieces are pink (Pantone 219, the signature Barbie color), and the construction choices are scenes like a fashion boutique, a mansion and an ice cream cart. Each set comes with a small Barbie figure that can be snapped into the scene. Mattel, the world’s largest toy maker, still leans heavily on Barbie, one of its most popular and longest-running franchises. However, pressure to update Barbie has been high — Mattel has introduced Barbies with video cameras and digital cameras in recent years. Yet sales of Barbie in North America through September fell 1 percent, even as sales of Mattel’s other girl brands, like Disney Princess dolls, rose 44 percent. Mega Brands makes just a fraction of what its larger rival Lego does, and had revenues of about 376 million last year. The Barbie brand, which tends to raise feminists’ ire for its overly sexualized dolls, not to mention the 1992 version saying “Math class is tough,” has already taken some high-arched steps toward gender equality. A computer-engineer Barbie was introduced two years ago, for instance, with the support of the Society of Women Engineers. This time, though, the introduction appears to be a response more to market changes than to critics. Girls “don’t necessarily care about, ‘That’s a boy toy; that’s not for me,’ ” said Ms. Cota of Mattel. “Now, more so than ever, girls are looking at what’s fun, what they like.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A 13-year-old activist, McKenna, is petitioning toy maker Hasbro to stop marketing the Easy-Bake Oven only to young girls and asks for images of boys to also be placed on the packaging.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year.

Cards Against Humanity unpacks Donald Trump survival kit Donald Trump has come to Cards Against Humanity, though the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has been the focus of similar card games for several weeks. The maker of fill-in-the-blanks card games, which describes itself as “a party game for horrible people,” announced the presale of its Trump-themed expansion pack Wednesday and promptly sold out of its 10,000 sets. It includes more than just 25 Trump cards: It comes with a full survival kit. The Donald Trump Bug-Out Bag, 25, includes 15 items, among them food rations, water-purification tablets, a hand-crank radio, a gas mask, a harmonica, a Mexican citizenship application, seed packets and a locket with a photo of Barack Obama. As for the cards themselves, they include prompts like “Donald Trump has nominated _________ for his VP,” and answers like “A gnawing sense of dread” and “Whipping lower-class white men into a xenophobic frenzy.” The Donald Trump Bug-Out Bag announcement came after several groups have created their own Trump-related card games styled after Cards Against Humanity. Ad agency Sid Lee announced an expansion pack called “Trump Against Humanity” at the end of April. Toy and housewares maker SCS Direct released a game called “Humanity Hates Trump.” Another, more general, product is the 2016 Election Game, which includes cards that reference other candidates, like Ben Carson and Bernie Sanders. SCS Direct alleged in a lawsuit that Cards Against Humanity complained to Kickstarter about Humanity Hates Trump, resulting in the upstart card game being taken off the crowdfunding site. Cards Against Humanity declined to comment. The company says on its website that the Donald Trump Bug-Out Bag will ship in June. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity, creating a Donald Trump-themed expansion pack called the \\"Donald Trump Bug-Out Bag.\\" Cards Against Humanity is a fill-in-the-blanks card game that self-identifies as “a party game for horrible people.” The introduction of the Trump-themed expansion pack follows other groups that have created their own Trump-related card games styled after Cards Against Humanity. The Donald Trump Bug-Out Bag includes more than just 25 Trump cards; it comes with a full survival kit containing 15 items, such as food rations, water-purification tablets, a hand-crank radio, a gas mask, a harmonica, a Mexican citizenship application, seed packets, and a locket with a photo of Barack Obama. The cards themselves have prompts related to Donald Trump and his campaign. The announcement and presale of this expansion pack prompted the sale of all 10,000 sets offered by the company. The pack is set to ship in June."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who enlisted the help of four producers? ? Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign. Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical...

If we pretend that your toys are data, then disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module, or TPM, are like really cool superheroes. Disk encryption is like a superhero who changes the appearance of your toys so that the bad guys can't recognize or use them.

This happened in a city called Baghdad on October 18. Now, let's look at the options to see which topic this is about. It's not about Sports because there's no game or competition involved. It's not about Business because it doesn't talk about companies or money matters. And it's not about Science/Tech because it doesn't mention any scientific discoveries or cool gadgets.
